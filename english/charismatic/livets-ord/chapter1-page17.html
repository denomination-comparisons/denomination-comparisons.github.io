        <p>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed (Galatians 1:6-9).</p>
        <p>Paul is deeply concerned because he knows what is at stake. In verse 12 he says, For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ. Paul, and believers throughout church history have contended to preserve the purity of the gospel so that it should continue to be God's power for the salvation of everyone who believes.</p>
        <p>The devil hates the gospel. He hates revelation, he hates the Bible and he hates Jesus. This is why he shoots his 'fiery darts' at everything God has said. No wonder the first thing the Bible says about the devil is that he sows doubt on God's word: Has God indeed said ... ? (Genesis 3:1) and he has continued with his scheme ever since. Therefore, it is crucial that we accept the Bible's testimony and view of itself. If we did not have God's written revelation of Himself in the Scriptures, people would never be saved, and the devil knows it.</p>

        <p>Inspiration is the means by which the Holy Spirit communicates this revelation.</p>
        <p>Illumination is the influence exerted by the Holy Spirit on each believer so that he or she can receive, understand and obey what is revealed.</p>
        <p>First Corinthians 2:14 says that the things of the Spirit of God are spiritually discerned or spiritually examined and appraised. Likewise, verse 13 says, ...comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
