        <h2>The Inspiration of the Bible</h2>
        <p>How, then, were the authors of the Bible inspired and how did revelation come to man?</p>
        <p>First, the Spirit of God moved upon a writer. To Jeremiah, He said, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth (Jeremiah 1:9), and similarly, David</p>
        <p>says, The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and His word was on my tongue (2 Samuel 23:2).</p>
        <p>These words, which were often prophecies concerning the future, were written down by the prophets who uttered them. Even the recording of their prophecies was inspired by the Spirit of God. He expressly said to Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah and others, Write in a book for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you (Jeremiah 30:2, see also Exodus 17:14 and Isaiah 30:8)</p>
        <p>When the words were written down, God watched over them to see that they were not altered or lost. In Jeremiah 1:12 He says, You have seen well, for I am ready to perform My word. God safeguards His word on its way from His heart to man's. Why?</p>
        <p>The answer is found in Isaiah 55:10-11:</p>
        <p>For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and do not return there, but water the earth and make it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish what I please and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>
        <p>Here are some things the Bible says about itself.</p>
        <p>1. God created heaven and earth with His Word (Genesis 1:1-3).</p>
        <p>2. God's Word is living (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
