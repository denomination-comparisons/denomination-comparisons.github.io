        <p>4. When He was betrayed and taken captive (Matthew 26:31).</p>
        <p>5. When He died on the cross (Matthew 27:46).</p>
        <p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus obviously considered every word and letter in the Scripture to be significant. In Matthew 5:18, He says, For assuredly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. He also says, Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away (Matthew 24:35).</p>
        <p>Every time Jesus mentions a person, an event or a prophetic utterance in the Old Testament, He takes the record to be true. Never does He question or alter the Scripture. Jesus never doubted the truths or the existence of persons mentioned in the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>Jesus names Adam and Eve as historical persons who actually lived (Matthew 19:4; Mark 10:6), and (Matthew 10:15; 11:24; Luke 17:29). He went on to talk about the Queen of the South (Sheba) who visited Solomon (Matthew 12:42) and referred to the prophet Jonah without doubting his experience in the belly of a huge fish (Matthew 12:40).</p>
        <p>In John's gospel 8:31-32, Jesus says, If you abide in My word, you are My disciples. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
        <p>Jesus is God's Son. He was God "in the flesh", that is, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14). He is the truth (John 14:6), His words will never pass away (Matthew 24:35) and they set people free (John 8:31-32). Therefore, we have to draw the conclusion that everything Jesus says is reliable.</p>
