        <p>Second Timothy 3:16-17 explains, All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. In other words, the purpose of the Bible is to produce mature men and women of God. This implies that one must accept that its authors were led by the Holy Spirit to write what they did in the way that they did.</p>
        <p>Scripture is sufficient. Moreover, it is consistent. Even if many authors over a long period wrote what they received from God, there is nevertheless a single theme that permeates throughout: salvation and redemption. Behind every author there is another author, namely, the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Bible is clear. It is not obscure or muddled but gives a straightforward account of the plan of salvation. If every individual topic in the Bible is fitted into the grand, overall theme—the plan of salvation—the Bible presents precisely what man needs to be saved.</p>
