        <p>self and my experiences, nor by 2) a rationalistic approach where my own limited reason must grasp everything, nor by 3) merely human traditions. The Bible is understood through the illumination of the Holy Spirit and is lived out in the Christian community where we benefit from the ways in which others have understood and practiced the Word of God. We need one another.</p>
        <h2>THE PURPOSE OF THE BIBLE—SALVATION</h2>
        <p>It is vital we understand the purpose of the Bible. The Bible is not designed to provide us with a detailed explanation of the mutual relationship of molecules during creation. The purpose of the Bible is to provide us with an overall picture and explanation of the plan of salvation that can be understood by everyone in every generation, age and culture. Then, they can come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.</p>
        <p>Second Timothy 3:16-17 explains, All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. In other words, the purpose of the Bible is to produce mature men and women of God. This implies that one must accept that its authors were led by the Holy Spirit to write what they did in the way that they did.</p>
        <p>Scripture is also consistent. Even if many authors over a long period wrote what they received from God, there is nevertheless a single theme that permeates throughout: salvation and redemption. Behind every author there is another author, namely, the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Bible is clear. It is not obscure or muddled but gives a straightforward account of the plan of salvation. If every individual topic in the Bible is fitted into the grand, overall theme—the plan of salvation—the Bible presents precisely what man needs to be saved.</p>
