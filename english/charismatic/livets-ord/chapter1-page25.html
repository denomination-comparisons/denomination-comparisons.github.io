        <p>of God." This is an insidious and treacherous statement. On completely arbitrary grounds, anyone can decide which words in the Bible are God's Words and which are not. Such reasoning produces further problems:</p>
        <p>a) It is I, not God, who decides what He has said.</p>
        <p>b) What I take to be God's Word, possibly someone else does not.</p>
        <p>c) What seems to be God's Word today does not tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>Jesus Believed the Bible</h2>
        <p>How, then, did Jesus regard the Bible? To answer this, we cannot look at the opinions of various churches, traditions, movements or preachers. Instead we should discover what the Scriptures have to say about themselves and how Jesus viewed them.</p>

        <p>1. When Satan tempted Him in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11).</p>
        <p>2. When the Pharisees disputed with Him (Matthew 15:1-9).</p>
        <p>3. When He argued with his adversaries from the basis of a single word in Scripture (Matthew 22:43-45).</p>
