        <h2>The Authors—Led by the Spirit of God</h2>
        <p>As we saw in Second Timothy 3:16, the Bible is inspired by God and this is vital. People wrote the Bible, but they were led by God as they did so...for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21).</p>
        <p>All the authors were led by the Holy Spirit. They were people of varying background, education, personality and interests. Among them we find David, the king, and Amos, the shepherd. We find Daniel, the high-ranking official in Babylon, and Peter, the Jewish fisherman. In their characteristic styles of diction, they wrote down what God gave them. These records were carefully preserved and today we have them as the Bible.</p>
        <p>The Bible clearly states that what God says is true. Jesus says of Himself, I am the way, the truth and the life... (John 14:6). Both the authors of the Bible and believers in every age have maintained that God speaks truth.</p>
        <p>In John 17:17 Jesus says, Your word is truth, and David says in Psalm 19:7-9, The law of the Lord is perfect...the testimony of the Lord is sure...The statutes of the Lord are right...The judgments of the Lord are true... In Psalm 119:151,160, the writer says, ...all Your commandments are truth...The entirety of Your word is truth...</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the Bible authors took what they were writing to be true, inspired, God-given and historically and morally correct. Jesus frequently quoted the Bible of His time, the Old Testament, referring to people and places as though they had actually existed and events as though they had really occurred. For Jesus, the Son of God, these things were facts, not myths or legends.</p>
        <p>Whenever the Bible has become the target of harsh criticism, it has invariably been on secularised, non-Christian grounds. Even if so-called 'Christian' theologians have attacked the Bible, they have always done so from a basis foreign to the Bible itself. For Jesus, the apostles and the early church, it was a given fact that the Scriptures were authoritative and reliable, both from a historical and a moral point of view.</p>
