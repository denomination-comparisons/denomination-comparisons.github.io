        <p>In his letter, Jude writes, Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints (Jude v 3).</p>
        <p>In many cases today, classic Christian faith is misrepresented, diluted and distorted. While it is important to continue taking bold, new steps of faith in an intrepid, pioneer spirit, it is equally vital to safeguard the faith, which has belonged to born again believers in every generation. [Page 10]</p>
        <p>In every age, God has worked through His Spirit and His Word in Christ Jesus. Each generation has made fresh discoveries and gained new insights, always founded on Scripture. The Holy Spirit has entrusted precious things to the Church, and while believers have experienced specific manifestations, they have been blind to others. At times, the Holy Spirit has led believers to rediscover lost 'spiritual capital' but at other times, obvious truths have been forgotten, despised or ignored altogether.</p>
        <p>Together, the body of Christ has a fantastic treasury of fundamental truths and spiritual experiences. Before Jesus returns, He intends to reveal and restore all things, and not least the basic truths of the Christian faith. These truths are the beams and the strong bulwark that support the whole 'house' and enable God's glory to be manifested in His spiritual temple— the church. [Page 11]</p>
        <p>I have long wanted to write a concise statement of faith that sums up the foundational doctrines of Christ. There is a need of fundamental Christian doctrine, particularly among young preachers and our Russian brethren.</p>
        <p>This book should not be regarded as a comprehensive theology; it is simply an outline which I hope to improve and develop in the future.</p>
        <p>It is my hope that each foundational tenet of the faith will make the Bible come alive to you and set your heart on fire. I pray that it will warm you, deepen your gratitude, increase your boldness and strengthen your faith. In this way, the next generation will be firmly established in its faith so that the fire can fall on them, too. [Page 12]</p>
        <p>God bless you in Christ Jesus,</p>
