    <main>
        <p>We all have, and require, some relationship to authority. For the believer, God is the final authority. The believer must fully accept that God's Word of living and speaking is the plumb line for life and faith. God has revealed Himself in the Scriptures and in His Son, Jesus Christ. These are therefore the highest authorities for every believer.</p>
        <p>It is here the battle has raged most ferociously. Throughout church history, the authority of the Scriptures has been disputed and attacked, although Jesus, Peter, Paul and the early church all held them to be unimpeachable. Backslidden and defiant worldly rebels have incessantly tried to dethrone God and His Word in an attempt to enthrone themselves. They have rejected the final authority of God and His Word and appointed themselves instead—to their own ruin.</p>
        <h2>Traditions and Experiences</h2>
        <p>To this day, there have only ever been three rival powers competing for the life of man:</p>
        <p>The first is Jesus Christ as Lord and the Bible as God's Word.</p>
        <p>The second is traditions and experiences. These include man's religious traditions, ideas and opinions, religious rituals and an arbitrary religious leadership. Jesus makes this clear when He says to the Pharisees:</p>
        <p>Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: "This people honours Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." ...making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down (Mark 7:6-9,13).</p>
        <p>These tendencies have been evident throughout history. People have modified the gospel and undermined the authority of the Bible. If not with outright scepticism, then with a profusion of myths, fables and traditions which origins can never be traced to Scripture. These traditions are then ascribed an authority equal to that of the Bible and are not uncommonly followed by statements like: "Only priests, the church and tradition can understand and interpret the Bible." Man nullifies the Word of God through his own traditions.</p>
