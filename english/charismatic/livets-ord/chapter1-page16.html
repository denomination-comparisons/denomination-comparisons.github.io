        <p>salvation known to man. God desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).</p>
        <h2>No Gospel—No Salvation!</h2>
        <p>Gradually, God revealed His intentions to mankind. In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul writes:</p>
        <p>...if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which was given to me for you, how that by revelation He made know to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already, by which, when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel, of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power (Ephesians 3:2-7).</p>
        <p>Through hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ, people can be saved and restored and find fellowship with God. The gospel reveals what God has done in Christ to save mankind. Without the gospel, no one can be saved. Thanks to God's general revelation of Himself, man can understand that</p>
        <p>God exists and that He has a plan for each life. But to enjoy fellowship with Him, man must hear and accept the gospel.</p>
        <p>Romans 1:16 says the gospel is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes... This gospel was given by revelation and written down in the Bible. Therefore, Paul is scrupulous about it not being altered or perverted. If the gospel is perverted people cannot be saved. No wonder that both the gospel and the Bible come under attack! Without them, man is lost. Paul says in his letter to the Galatians:</p>
        <p>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
