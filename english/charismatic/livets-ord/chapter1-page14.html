        <p>in writing, truths that were previously unknown to him.</p>
        <p>When God speaks to mankind, He does so with a purpose. He wants to reveal Himself, His power and His will to man, and to grant him knowledge, salvation and fellowship. God does not reveal Himself to man merely to provide general information that satisfies his curiosity. He reveals Himself in order to restore man to Himself.</p>

Only fools suppress the truth (Romans 1:18) by denying what nature is unfailingly telling them: "There is a God."</p>
        <p>The second way in which God has imparted general revelation to man is through his conscience. We read in Romans:</p>
