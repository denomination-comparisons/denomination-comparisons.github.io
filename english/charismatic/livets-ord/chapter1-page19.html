        <p>Man holds something other than the Bible as authority. Man-made opinions and religious rituals are elevated to the same level of authority as the Word of God. These ideas are then inculcated upon the people so that they dare not disobey.</p>
        <p>This is a grave form of oppression. Human traditions drain God's Word of its power, and prevent men from receiving it and being saved. Dead religiosity and human traditions become a substitute for the gospel, enslaving rather than emancipating mankind.</p>
        <h2>The Mind Can Deceive</h2>
        <p>A third rival authority competing with the Word of God is the human intellect. This is the trap of rationalism. Rationalism so elevates human intellect that it replaces God and becomes the final authority. If traditionalism says, “We’ve never done it this way before,” </p>
        <p>rationalism says, “I can’t believe that because I can’t understand it.”  </p>
        <p>God created the human mind to consider, analyse, evaluate, investigate and develop. Man’s mind has enormous potential, but it is also fallible and limited. When Job questioned God’s actions, He responded, *Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding* (Job 38:4).  </p>
        <p>To exalt the human mind to ‘God’ or judge and final authority, is to set up an idol. When man, with his limited intellect, judges and criticizes God and His Word, His plans and His methods, he becomes totally lost.</p>
        <p>Rationalism leads to biblical criticism that questions the Bible on completely false grounds, namely, those of humanistic, secularised thinking. Rejecting everything that it deems improbable or extraordinary, rationalism becomes nothing more than a weak moralistic mix. A Christian believes that Jesus performed miracles, not because tradition maintains it or because his mind accepts it, but because Scripture says it. God has spoken in His Word and what He says is true, however fantastic it may seem to the mind of modern, secularised man.</p>
        <p>In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul says:</p>
        <p>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ be made of no effect...Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe (1 Corinthians 1:17, 20-21).</p>
        <p>Wisdom apart from God is foolishness. God's wisdom may seem foolish to the man in the street, but it has power to save because it is truth. This leads to varying views of the Bible. When people ask, "What view of the Bible do you hold?" or "What school of thought do you follow?" they really mean, "What is your final authority? Is it traditionalism or rationalism? Or is it perhaps, the Bible?"</p>
        <p>In every great spiritual awakening since the birth of the church until today, Christians have consistently believed what the Reformation asserted —"Scripture alone!" God's Word is true, valid and authoritative. That is sufficient!</p>
        <h2>The Purpose of the Bible—Salvation</h2>
        <p>It is vital we understand the purpose of the Bible. The Bible is not designed to provide us with a detailed explanation of the mutual relationship of molecules during creation. The purpose of the Bible is to provide us with an overall picture and explanation of the plan of salvation that can be understood by everyone in every generation, age and culture. Then, they can come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved.</p>
