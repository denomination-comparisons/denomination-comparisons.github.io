        <p>The word tradition is a delicate word and it is easy for some Christian groups to be suspicious of it. Jesus warns us of human traditions that rise up against God's word (Mark 7:6-13). But the Bible also clearly speaks of a true tradition. Tradition means to pass on, transfer, to give and receive in a faithful way. The Greek word for "transfer" is paradosis which also translate into "tradition, teaching" (2 Thessalonians 2:15) and paralambano, "to receive" in First Corinthians 11:23. It was the teaching and revelation that Jesus gave to the apostles that became the teaching of the apostles (1 Corinthians 15:3; Jude 3). It was transferred to them and they received it (1 Corinthians 15:1) and were to faithfully preserve it (1 Timothy 6:14, 20) and equally faithfully pass it on to others (2 Timothy 2:2). This is a living tradition, inspired by the Holy Spirit, who after having inspired the Word, makes sure that it is faithfully handed down from generation to generation. The Scripture is meant to be lived and that life is a life in the Holy Spirit. That means that tradition also means those experiences of faith that Christians in all times have had, based on and in accordance with the Word of God and led by the Holy Spirit. In other words, we do not reject what the Spirit has said and done in and through the church, throughout the centuries, in many different situations and with many different experiences. As you know, everything does not begin with us in our time and it does not end with us and our experiences. Sometimes people have too much of an individualistic approach, as if the Christian life was lived in solitary confinement, where the only things that exist are I, Jesus and the Bible. And that is certainly not the case. We all live as members in the body of Christ and we need the understanding the Spirit has given to others in the body, both in our time and in times past. It is in the body of Christ, in communion with each other and in common obedience to Jesus and attentiveness to the Holy Spirit that we may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height (Ephesians 3:18). No man is an isolated island.</p>
        <p>My understanding of the Bible should therefore neither be governed by 1) an over-individualistic approach where everything is based in my-</p>
