today I'm going to be sharing a really important message of critical message
and this is how to maintain your deliverance
how to stay free and go from glory to glory walking in
the Abundant Life that God has given you amen
so this is very important take notes re plan to watch it again we'll have it
recorded on our YouTube Facebook Instagram everywhere amen so
it says in the word and Matthew 12 43. when an impure Spirit comes out of a
person it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it then it says I will return to the house
I left when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes with it
seven other Spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there in the
final condition of that person is worse than the first this is how it will be with this wicked generation
so the passion translation says uh
it goes back once it's cast out only to find that the
house is vacant warm and ready for it to move back in
so what happens is when a demon is cast out what happens is that the king of demons
and the king of demons the devil is not happy that that demon was cast
out it's not happy that that person is now set free is not happy that he no longer has a grip and a hold on that
person's life so that person cannot glorify God the most and cannot walk in
their calling and destroy the devil's Kingdom this is why this is why the devil sends
demons is to keep people who are children of God from glorifying God the most
because we glorify God the most when we are when we are showing what Jesus has done
on the cross for us which is not just that when we die we go to heaven and
have Abundant Life there but that we that Jesus has saved us here and now saved us saved us from the devil's grip
Here and Now that he has removed our chains he has set us free we don't have addiction
depression anxiety sickness anymore we've been freed from those things
that's what Jesus did and now we're walking an Abundant Life abundant peace abundant joy and abundance in every area
that's how we shine the brightest for God that's what gives God the most glory and that it's our light that leads
people to Jesus Jesus shining the most brightly in US so to be fully free and walk in in that
Abundant Life that should be priority for us if we want to see people saved
that should be the biggest priority that we are making sure that we are free we are walking Abundant Life so our light
can be bright so people can be led to Jesus rather than not being focused on that and like
just speak preaching the gospel preaching the gospel but not carrying the power and not shining brightly
there's such a difference between someone preaching the gospel with the light of Jesus shining through them in
their eyes and the power of God moving through the person because they're free and they're filled
and they're shining bright there's a difference a big difference between that and someone in bondage someone not
carrying the anointing and preaching the gospel amen so I mean you know the devil wants
to keep people in bondage to put demons in people because he hates us he hates people but even more than that he knows
that this is how to keep children of God pinned down from being effective for for God and
destroy the devil's Kingdom so we as children of God need to understand that
the devil does not want us to be free and the devil is not going to be happy
when we've been freed we need to this scripture is powerful because it shows it shows what's going
on in the spiritual realm when a demon leaves in the spiritual realm that demon wants
to come back in the spiritual realm the devil wants that demon to come back and more
because he's the devil's being shamed when a person is freed so now the devil
really wants to shame Christians and God by making it worse for the person than
it was before bringing more demons and more powerful demons so that's where the devil's heads at
so number one we need to know this truth in the spiritual realm we need to know that we are in a battle in the spiritual
realm we need to know that we gotta be cautious we gotta take this
seriously the principle of maintaining our deliverance
we need to take it so seriously because the devil means serious business and we don't want him to win we want to
keep our freedom so we got to be serious about it amen so this scripture shares with us that
that demon wants to come back wants to bring more and more powerful ones and
the scripture it's saying the demon leaves and it looks it's not seen every time it's saying on some
occasions it looks and finds that that that vessel is
vacant warm and ready for it to move back in so basically what that is saying
is that vessel that human inside in the spiritual realm where that demon was it
looks the same there's no change the demon left and then there was no
change it's vacant it's still vacant it's still warm from the demon
it's it's ready it's prepared for that demon to just go right back in there and be comfortable
so when a demon leaves part of taking this seriously and maintaining your your
deliverance is to know that you got to change some things
it's got to look real different inside so that demon doesn't find that
doesn't find it warm vinca and ready but they see I can't go back in there
that's what the demons got to find so this is what I'm going to be teaching
you of how to make sure you're filled it's not vacant and the demon cannot go
in amen [Applause]
and I also want to mention um so witches are the ones which is warlocks
are the ones that send demons so they do witchcraft they've been given power from
the devil they begin giving power to have authority over demons in the
spiritual Realm um to send them to vessels to send them to people
only where they have authority to the only place they have authority to send
demons is when a person is allowing them to come when a person has opened up a
door in the spiritual Realm and that happens when you are you have
not given your life to Jesus or that happens when you have given your life to Jesus you are a child of God you're a
Christian but you have doors open in your life in the spiritual Realm
unknowingly or knowingly that's when there's legal access
in a witch a warlock can see I have authority here to send a demon here because they're allowing me to because
they left the door open now when a demon is sent out when it is
cast out where does it go it mostly goes back to the witches or
warlocks that sent it sometimes they go to the pit
um but as we as we see with Jesus he was concerned with casting them out
he wasn't concerned with killing them all off his job was to cast them out
there was one time when the demons were they were speaking that were in a
they were in a man and they were speaking Jesus don't send us to the pit send us into pigs instead
and Jesus did it well why didn't Jesus say nope you're dying your time is no more
he can do that do that sometimes too that can sometimes be possible but I'm getting deep here in
the spiritual realm Hallelujah but the thing is is that
the devil's allowed to exist it will be different when we go to
heaven and in the new heaven that will be when Jesus returns
that will be different in in heaven the kingdom of the devil is
not allowed to operate at all in heaven
but here on Earth the devil's allowed to exist and have a kingdom
the kingdom of God is much more powerful and has Hallelujah
and now has victory over the devil's Kingdom always that happened when Jesus
paid the price on the cross and Resurrected now the kingdom of God is the Victorious
over the devil always but the thing is is that every human on this Earth that's placed
on this Earth they have free will so the devil's allowed to exist he's
allowed to have a kingdom that's always less powerful than God's kingdom but he's allowed to have a kingdom
and every human on this Earth has free will they're not forced to give their life to Jesus they're not forced to have
a relationship with Jesus they're not forced to go to heaven that's how it is
God gave us all free will so because of that the devil is allowed to have demons
people if they want to have demons they can have demons we're not supposed to get in the Free
Will of that in the way of the Free Will of that of their choice
that's why it's very wrong to be forcing Jesus on people because that's not what brings
repentance the kindness of God brings repentance
so demons are allowed to exist the devil is allowed to send demons out witches are allowed to
operate on this Earth so it's not the time yet we're not in
heaven yet Jesus hasn't returned yet and every all that happens after that where the devil
goes completely down for real for real amen but that time hasn't come yet so that's
why when we cast out demons it's not like I cast you out and I kill you our mission isn't like to kill every demon
on the Earth our mission is to cast them out of the children of God cast them out
Hallelujah cast them out out of those who will come to Jesus
that's that's our job that the Bible calls us to cast out demons not do this
and this and this and this and this to the demons with the demons but to Simply cast them out
so that every person who would come to Jesus would be free of the Demons as simple as that
but we can't do anything about people's free will amen
Hallelujah
so the first oh the end of the scripture that I just
shared with you it says that is how it will be with this wicked generation where
a demon will see that there's a vacant space they can come back and come back with more
passion translation says that's how this will happen to the people of this evil generation
and so what the the reason that that these
demons come back and come back with more are because of two things a person number one is not valuing
Jesus their deliverer what Jesus has done for them
who Jesus is in their life to them they're not valuing
and number two they're because they're not valuing they're not surrendering
their life to Jesus these are the two
big principles of how to maintain your deliverance and then everything else that I teach you you'll be able to do
to be able to maintain your deliverance after you do these two things value your
deliverance value Jesus value your Lo the Lord of
Jesus in your life his lordship and your life and surrender your whole life to Jesus
those are the big big things right there big principles and so when it's talking about this is
how it will be with this evil Wicked generation is talking about people who
receive deliverance and don't value it don't value what God has done for them and they just keep on living life one
foot in the world they don't value their Deliverance enough that they allow people to speak
lies to them they listen to the accuser of the brethren
and they start to doubt their Deliverance because they did not value it
they received Deliverance they didn't value enough to be serious about maintaining their deliverance and so now
they they don't surrender to God and they start to open up doors and so boom this is this is what happens the demons
come back and so then their life seems to be worse and they lost their Deliverance
and so then they go and they listen to jealous and demonic voices
people saying that wasn't really Deliverance you weren't really delivered you actually got worse demons were
actually put in you the accuser of the Brethren says lies like this
and and the wicked and evil generation who doesn't value the Deliverance who doesn't remember really what God has
done for them and and understand it's the doors I opened that led to more demons come back and mean being worse
than before they believe these lies that's wicked that's evil amen this this
happens I've seen this happen where people who have genuinely received Deliverance people who have praised God
I've seen them in my own Ministry see them praise God see them be touched by
God no doubt about it see the joy see the tears and even hear them testify
that God has indeed freed them I've seen them
open up doors allow more demons to come and allow these demonic voices to speak to them
and then to speak against the servant of God that cast the demons out
it is it is a minister it is every ministers
and believer's job but mostly ministers especially responsibility to cast out demons this
is our commission all who believe these signs shall follow they will cast out demons they shall heal the sick or one of this a couple of the signs
and so especially ministers especially five-fold ministers even though we don't see it today but this is how it's
supposed to be and this is what's being restored the ACT church is being restored in this end time Revival
but it really should be a responsibility for ministers to cast
out demons of people who come to their Church who are oppressed by demons
because I mean Jesus Jesus says in the word of God to his disciples to his Apostles you cast out demons he doesn't
say tell the people how to cast out demons out of themselves is because when a person is in bondage
they're really in bondage they they need the anointing destroys
the Yoke they need the anointing a higher anointing where a person isn't in bondage because the anointing can't grow
very much on a person who's in bondage okay so they need a higher anointing to destroy the yoke
that's why Jesus says to the disciples you cast out demons you need to help the people
that are in bondage they can't help themselves in this area you have to release the anointing take the authority
cast out the demon so really I mean this is the commission that God has given us cast out demons so
ministers we have this responsibility and by the way really it's time now now that God is opening up eyes it's not
like deliverance and his Revival his anointing is hidden anymore really any Minister that that they're
pastoring they're leading in their church and they don't have the anointing to cast out demons they should humble
themselves and seek out to the anointing position themselves where the anointing is to receive impartation
really it should be a serious responsibility I was told by God to cast
out demons and I understand the principle of receiving anointing most times it comes through impartation so I
better humble myself position myself so I can receive impartation so I can fulfill the Great Commission that God has commanded me to do
I don't want to be judged by God that I didn't deliver his people and they stayed in bondage
it's a big deal we're representing Jesus and so man we better be representing him
right otherwise people will come in bondage they'll stay in bondage and they'll say I I guess Jesus can't free me
because I went to the church and I wasn't freed so it's a Minister's responsibility to
cast demons out of people who are oppressed
and that's not just done through one-on-one Prayer by that I mean executing the authority and releasing the anointing like just speaking the
word it's happening to many all who are oppressed
so it's The Minister's responsibility to execute the authority to cast out the demons out of the people who are oppressed but it is not the
responsibility of the minister for that person to maintain their Deliverance so they cast The Demon out
it's the person who is delivered it's their responsibility to maintain their Deliverance that's on them
completely 100 on them we do have a responsibility to be preaching these messages like I'm
preaching today and this message that I'm preaching
today will have on video I have a previous maintaining your deliverance that we make sure we send out to every
whenever I do revivals now events we have the emails we email them all the message and we always announce it after
the service is here make sure you watch this because it's so important so this
message will be recorded on YouTube make sure you send this out to all your friends and your family who have been
freed or haven't been freed yet but need Deliverance really everyone they need this this message so this we do have
this responsibility as ministers and as believers who cast out demons of others
we have this responsibility to to equip people to be able to maintain their Deliverance
but it's on them to listen to the message and to meditate on it
and take it in and live it um
just as it says in James 1 21 get rid of moral filth and the evil that is so
prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you which can save you do not
merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says
anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and after
looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like but whoever looks intently into the
perfect law that gives Freedom or we can say the perfect word of God that gives
Freedom or we can say the the Revelation the Rhema present tense word of God
spoken today that gives freedom so this word gives freedom
so those who looked intently to this perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it not forgetting what they
have heard but doing it they will be blessed in what they do so
when you really follow the word of God the word of God written word of God and
the Revelation from the Holy Spirit release the Rhema present tense word of God look intently and do it then you
will be set free and you will maintain your deliverance you will walk an abundant life
amen Hallelujah
so number one you need to value
your deliverance value it and remember it
when God has delivered you it looks different for a lot of people for some people there's multiple parts to it
there's the moment where they actually tangibly felt God or just had this
Encounter With Jesus they felt the demons literally leave them they were pushed down by the power of
God they felt God freed them and then they were filled with uncontainable joy
and peace amen sometimes Hallelujah
sometimes at least that that that freedom and uncontainable joy
leads a person to be jumping up and down and screaming and weeping sometimes
someone's laying here on the Altar for like two hours after God delivered them
because God's still doing a mighty work in them filling them with his Spirit doing a spiritual surgery
um and and then they see the evidence of the Deliverance in their life you know
not just that one-time experience at church and the power but they see now
that they're no longer addicted to the drug or the alcohol or the porn they no
longer have anxiety they no longer have depression they no longer have Suicidal Thoughts they no longer have demonic
nightmares they're seeing the evidence of it so that's how Deliverance looks for some people and then others they
don't have that tangible feeling they're not feeling actually the demons go none
of that but the night after this church service or
the night of or the next day or two days later suddenly they find that they're not
addicted to that thing anymore suddenly they find that they don't have the anxiety anymore the depression anymore
the suicidal thoughts anymore Etc so it's different some people you
know they have also that it's tangible experience with God and sometimes not but both are equally beautiful and both
are equally freedom and and both better be valued nobody can
deliver you from that addiction anxiety depression generational curse of sickness of poverty demonic night
terrors seizures nobody can deliver you from that but Jesus Christ
no doctor no counseling no therapy no witchcraft
no self-help book no Seance no ritual
no worldly meditation nothing can deliver can can get rid of that other
things can cover up and medicate and numb but nothing no one can deliver you
from that thing but Jesus Christ [Applause]
and none of us deserves that none of us deserves that that Deliverance that
freedom that Jesus brings and and for many people that they got
themselves into that situation themselves they opened up the door themselves it's what they reaped none of
us deserves that but this is a free gift that God's given us we didn't have to pay for it we didn't have to jump
through hoops it was a free gift God's given us so
what what is more valuable than that in this whole world
than Jesus saving you and freeing you it's something to be valued and
cherished among among riches and jewels and gold and diamonds and everything in
this world it's something to be valued and cherished and so um
you need to you need to really be intentional to Value it do not see it as
cheap value what God has done value it by
thanking God continually for what he's done for the Deliverance value by meditating and writing down and
watching the Deliverance video if you have it and testifying and even listening to
your own testimony testifying directly after it when you're you remembers everything so clearly and
fresh and watch it or listen to it and make it a practice a habit to thank God every
day thank you Jesus for freeing me from this and from this and from this now my life is like this now I am free I don't
have this anymore and my life used to be like horrible and in bondage [Applause]
make it a practice um because otherwise you're opening up a door to
the devil to stay take your deliverance so you know what I'm about valuing this
is part of filling the inside of you so that the demons see it can't come back
um so Exodus 14 12. God had delivered the Israelites from
hundreds of years of bondage of slavery he did it so miraculously no one could
imagine this could ever be possible that Pharaoh their King who is so
hard-hearted that he would just say Okay millions of you can just leave and I'll have no
workers no slaves at all no one could imagine this is possible in
any way right only by God and God did so many signs and wonders and miracles to
make pharaoh to finally let them go and so there is so much that God did
there were so many signs and wonders so many that they witnessed with their own eyes
yet after they stepped out of Egypt and they're just beginning their Journey
away and beginning the journey towards the promised land they come to the Sea
they come to water and all of a sudden behind them is Pharaoh in his army
and these Israelites say Exodus 14 12. it would have been better
for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert
it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert so listen
you already know that they they did not value they did not value enough what God
had did for them that Deliverance because if they had valued enough that their thinking God continually that
they're meditating their their bringing to remembrance those signs and those
wonders the water turning to Red before their eyes and all the plagues that came
just because God was that was God delivering them you know if they had brought it to remembrance whoa all those
plagues that God did that would have built their faith to be so strong and
they would have seen that water and they would have seen the Army after them and they would have said God I wonder what
you're going to do next God's not done yet with his signs and
wonders right they would not have immediately doubted
and said I just wish I stayed in Egypt
I don't even care about all the signs and wonders I just witnessed looks like we're gonna die now because there's
water here and there's an army behind us it literally shows they weren't that I
mean because this is what happens when you value what God has done for you when you meditate on his faithfulness where
he's brought you from how you've seen him come through in your life when you meditate on that that's what builds your faith
and so when an obstacle comes in your way your first thought is God's Gonna
do a miracle this can't stay I mean I've seen him do so many things in the past and I know
who he is in my life he's faithful so there's going to be breakthrough I believe
[Applause] and so remember in the beginning of this
message I shared with you we have to be aware that the devil is not happy when we receive Deliverance
the devil which if he's not happy that means he's gonna he's gonna attack but no weapon formed against you can prosper
when you're actually surrendered to God and being serious about maintaining your deliverance and serving him
but those attacks are going to come so are you gonna value what God did so
your faith can grow and be surrendered so you're not quick to speak a word of death but you're
quick to please God and speak a word of life and speak a word of faith [Applause]
and so and then you'll have victory
so this is what's going to happen when you are set free be expectant for a tax to
come be expectant to have victory but but be expectant that you're going
to have to use your faith muscle that's grown after your deliverance because you've
just you've just your faith has grown like never before because you've never seen God do such a mighty miracle in
your life than delivering you from the bondage you had for 20 years or something like that right
so be expectant for the the the weapons to come the attacks to come
and be strong in faith and resist them and walk in faith and
believe that that God's bringing you from glory to glory and you're not going backwards
but what happens is if people don't value what God has done and not let their faith to grow they see the attacks
come and they emit they become like the Israelites and they're like it's better to be where I was before
and they immediately listen to the the the devil's lies and they allow him to come back and come
back worse this comes from not valuing
value what God has done for you don't let the devil steal it do not forget and we as humans it's natural for us to
forget things like we have to take intention to remember Life's good and you forget what life
used to be like and then something comes your way and you you forget how good your life is now
compared to what it used to be
so value do what you have to do to Value what God has done for you
anything you don't value you don't you don't keep you lose
so number two surrender to God everything
if you value what God has done for you this is going to help you to surrender
many times what what leads people into surrender is their Deliverance because the bondage was so much torment
and they they had it for so long that when they encounter God's love and
goodness like this to deliver them from that it opens up their eyes to God's love that he truly is worthy of full
surrender of giving my whole life to him he's truly worthy I want to give my life to you Lord I don't want the things of
the world anymore because I just want to please you amen many times it's the Deliverance because it's for everybody
it's going to be an encounter with God an actual encounter an encounter with his power that's going to open up eyes
to his love to enable you to be able to surrender amen so
once you're delivered make sure if you haven't already surrendered to surrender
every part of your life your dreams your will your passions your
selfish Ambitions every single part your relationships your daily life how you
spend your time what you watch on your phone and on the TV everything surrender it to God
amen
in Ephesians 4 27 it says do not give the devil a footholds
so this means that we can this is written to Christians this is written to Believers this is New Testament this is
Paul speaking do not give a foothold to the devil that means an Open Door
that means space it's like leaving the door unlocked in
your apartment or house and even maybe cracked open a little bit that's a foothold that's a place that's
given permission for somebody to just come in an intruder to come in legal access technically
so that's what a foothold is so that this is saying that Christians you have the
free will this is the this is the reason right here why Christians can have demons because we have free will to leave the
door open or not we have free will to give the devil leave legal access or not
it's our choice just because we call ourselves a Christian doesn't mean we don't have free will in this area we
have free will in this area so this is how Christians can have demons when there is an Open Door
sometimes it's your own choice sometimes it happened generationally sometimes it happened as a child and you
weren't equipped children should be equipped with this meat they can take it they can understand it amen sometimes
you weren't equipped you weren't in the house of God where the meat was so you weren't equipped as a child and it happened when you were a child but how
it happens is when there's an open door so once you are delivered you need to
evaluate your life your spiritual life of what doors are remaining open
first of all when you come and seek Deliverance sometimes there's still a door open yet
God delivers you sometimes the door can't be shut until you're delivered for example demonic
soul ties when you have a relationship with someone and there's a demonic Soul tie
there sometimes you've tried to end the relationship so many times but there was
like a force keeping you you couldn't you were able to stick up for yourself you were able to say no to anybody else
but this person you just couldn't it was spiritual there's a force
keeping you stuck to this person so you needed Freedom you needed deliverance from that
demonic Soul tie you needed to be broken by the anointing and so once that was broken now you are free to end the
relationship you're free to say no you're free to set boundaries and you'll find that some of you have found that
that when you're free from demonic soul ties that now you could say no to the person you could end the relationship you could put the boundary
amen also addiction like drugs and alcohol
there's some people that they they throw away the drugs and the alcohol but they'll drive right back to the store
even though they don't want to be addicted they don't want to do drugs or alcohol and they want to serve God but
there's a demonic chain they are in literal bondage so until they need to come to the church
and they need to be free by the anointing that destroys the Yoke and then they'll find they don't have an appetite for the drugs or alcohol
anymore as long as they now keep the door shut
there's a window this is why it's important to shut the door that was open when you were even
delivered like these things because and this can happen with relationships there's like a window a
window of Grace so you so this happens a lot people are free from it from drugs and alcohol and
so they they leave they're they're set free and now they literally don't have a desire or a taste or a hunger for it
at all but they keep the alcohol there and then they think to themselves a few weeks later
wine I think I have just a glass you know it's just a class it's fine I don't have a desire for anymore so I
know I'll be fine just a glass but that's actually an Open Door
and so they take the one glass the drink of the one glass of wine and then they're finding themselves like really
craving another and then all of a sudden that demon came back
and then can go back with more same thing for relationships
um you know you could have this relationship many times like romantically and maybe you've there's so
much history together so much emotional history and ties like of course you
still like love the person but God's telling you not to be with them because you're not equally yoked and they have
demons and they don't want to be free of the demons and so that's just pulling You Into Darkness
if you stay with them and so you're free and then you now you find I I have the
power of God the freedom now to say no to set boundaries to leave the relationship and you do
but then the emotions get in the way after some time and you start to miss the person
and they start to of course the enemy then has a strategy
he waits a week or two weeks or a month and then he gets that
ex-boyfriend ex-girlfriend whoever it is to send you a text I miss you babe
[Laughter] and next thing you know oh
this is me I can just send him a text
and next thing you know you've you demon came back demonics will
take demonic Souls I came right back that's why I say there's a window of
Grace so once you're delivered leave this place and now make sure you shut that
door immediately get rid of all the alcohol all the drugs in the house
and the relationship immediately if that's what God's calling you to do set the boundaries immediate immediately if
that's what God's calling you to do get rid of all the porn on the computer
um unfollow the people on social media that you need to unfollow
delete the numbers you need to delete do it immediately once you're free
or else you're leaving the door open and that's how demons can come back and come back more you have to take it
seriously so this is number one you need to close the doors that were already open because
they couldn't be closed until you were free now you need to close them but number two you need to be serious about
the other open doors in your life that haven't led to bondage yet but will the
devil's coming for them now if you keep them open still because
um how it works with leaving the door open is just like um apart your apartment in your house
or your car you know sometimes sometimes you you might have might have
experienced this I know this happened to me one time like I always lock my door every time for my car but then maybe
there was probably a few times in my life I didn't you know just because you forget or something you're in a hurry and there was this one time I guess I
didn't I I don't I don't know what happened to this day but my car was broken into so I'm like I guess I must
have unlocked it because they didn't break it in but so this is how it is some you can leave the
door open it doesn't mean you're immediately getting a demon but it's very risky
it's not like I have the door open I'm for sure getting a demon but it's risky this is why you should always keep the
door shut so some of you you know you were delivered there was the main thing that
you need deliverance from but then you still have these open doors in your life you're still living lukewarm in some
areas and so once you are free the devil he knows he knows the doors you have open
he hasn't tried in those areas yet he's been content with that one area because you were in bondage he didn't need to go
anywhere else but now he want he's he wants to shame
God and shame you and shame the church so now oh he's after you he's looking
what doors so you need to get serious when you get delivered I gotta be serious I gotta
take my surrender to God seriously so you gotta
take inventory on your life what doors are open
stop speaking the words of death that's a big one stop speaking words of death only Speak
Life only Speak Life start being quiet that's what that's what I did at first when I
started getting this Revelation I was like I'm not going to speak unless it's with intention and it's God's will
so I gotta think before I speak I got to be slow to speak the Bible says that's why I say be quiet be slow to speak
don't talk immediately don't talk just to talk be slow to speak so God can train you to
only speak life so we can train you to be slow to speak and not to speak your emotions real quick
and end up speaking words of death over yourself or other people
um okay so I want to talk about a lot of some of these doors that we really need to be careful of to close so uh speaking
deaf alcohol Drugs porn in the house whatever those things were that could be an open
door for addiction this could also be scrolling on the phone too much being on social media too much
be real with yourself and it doesn't mean you have to get rid of social media in fact some people are
not walking in wisdom too much they'll be like I haven't been watching you Apostle Catherine because I deleted my Instagram
to fast it well that's not the way to go um
oh God will give you the constraint to to to to download the Instagram account just for
when I'm going live and then delete it or you know or check once a day the
notifications when when's the live gonna happen for example or you know Sunday it's a specific time and mark your
calendar don't miss it don't rely on your phone notifications for that time if you really need to fast the Instagram or something
but um God will give you constraints to be able to come because you need to be fed
you need to be fed you need to be fed the word of God and you need to receive the anointing in
your life so this is very important amen
um so bad entertainment be aware of what you're watching
maybe you're watching horror movies or impure movies all your life with no demons coming in but now that you're
free Devil's looking for a place you watch a horror movie all of a sudden you find you have anxiety out of nowhere
so close the doors on the um the entertainment that has an open
door for the Devil the the world the worldly entertainment
um and also the bad influences bad influences people in your life so these
are going to be the people that you've had soul ties with God's not calling you to be hanging out with worldly people he
calls you to love them but not to bring them in close as Jesus only brought 12 close and only
and three really close so he's not calling you to hang out and
be buddy Buddies with people doing the worldly things because that is leaving an open door to
the devil big time that's a big big one so be serious about the relationships in your
life who you're bringing in close and also you really need to be aware of who you are listening to as
I mentioned about these people who who lost their Deliverance because the devil
strategically sends them these demonic voices these voices of jealousy these
voices that are trying to take down a servant of God a Ministry where Deliverance has taken place
and they're always speaking the same thing either it wasn't really Deliverance it's demonic Powers that's
what they're speaking these people they are out there there are many of them so be aware who you are listening to be
aware that those lives will come God is not calling you to listen to everybody
be planted be listening where God has called you to be listening to you don't need to be
listening to Here There and Everywhere be still and receive
the real word of God that God wants to give you not all these Christian Christian voices
where some are disguised and they are really wolves these Christian voices that are coming
with jealousy coming to try to take down the work of God that's a big area that
the devil's coming to try to take people's Deliverance that's where he gets to shame God in the
church the most is when he turns something that's giving
God the most Glory someone who's delivered to now they're speaking against Jesus the deliverer himself
and saying that Deliverance isn't really real in all of that so be aware of who you're listening to
it's not wise to have your ear open to everybody you don't know who's going to be speaking what you don't know who's
going to be speaking good one day and bad the next day so that's why you need
to listen to God with where he's calling you to be planted and listen there listen where God is
calling you to listen to rather than not seeking God and just going let me listen to everything
amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[Applause]
so this is part one today of how to maintain your deliverance you are equipped you've been equipped today to
keep what you've received to keep your freedom to hang on to it and to go from glory to glory walking in Abundant Life
amen Hallelujah
