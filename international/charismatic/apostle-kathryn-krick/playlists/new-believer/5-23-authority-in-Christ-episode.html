hi i'm apostle catherine welcome to
another episode of revival is now
in the last episode i shared how in this
episode i'd be teaching you the next
step of how to fully access the abundant
life that jesus has given you the first
step is hearing the full gospel
receiving it and believing it so
believing that jesus has paid a price
for you to have an inheritance from him
that all he has is yours that healing
freedom and abundant life is yours the
next step into accessing this abundant
life that's already yours
is to walk in authority genesis 1 26 let
us make mankind in our image and let
them have complete authority over all
the earth the nkjv version says let them
have dominion in the beginning god
created humanity he created adam and eve
and when he created them he chose to
give them
dominion
or
authority
over
all of this earth that means that god
didn't create adam and eve and humanity
to be like robots god he's given
authority
to humanity he's chosen us
to rule over this earth
now adam and eve lost that authority
when they sinned and obeyed the devil
what actually happened was the devil was
trying to convince them to give the
authority that they
had already the devil did not have
authority at that point but we are given
free will and so there's repercussions
with our free will when we use our free
will not according to god's will
so that's what adam and eve did they
used their free will and when they did
that they actually handed over authority
to the devil and this is the real reason
why we see all these curses were
immediately thrown upon humanity and
when immediately our great need for a
savior jesus came
it's because adam and eve gave the
authority they had to the devil so jesus
when he came one of the big things he
did on that cross and as he resurrected
from the grave was he returned authority
to
god's children
so that authority that god originally
intended for humanity to have
it's now ours because of what jesus did
when you become a child of god when you
give your life to jesus you receive this
as a part of your inheritance
authority
over this earth over the spiritual realm
of darkness you have authority over
demons over the devil
i have given you authority to trample on
snakes and scorpions and to overcome all
the power of the devil nothing will harm
you jesus tells the disciples this after
they return from casting out demons for
the first time he tells them yes the
demons obeyed you because
i have given you authority now this is
before jesus went to the cross but this
was prophetic of what he had come to do
this is what we would all receive when
we gave our lives to jesus part of that
inheritance that we would have
authority just as the original disciples
did
over
all demonic powers be strong in the lord
and in his mighty power put on all of
god's armor so that you will be able to
stand firm against all strategies of the
devil for we are not fighting against
flesh and blood enemies but against evil
rulers and authorities of the unseen
world against mighty powers in this dark
world and against evil spirits in the
heavenly places so this is a word to
believers to us today
that we are in a spiritual war
every single day
there is an unseen war going on in the
spiritual realm jesus has defeated the
devil
when he defeated the devil the powerful
thing he did of defeating the devil was
taking that authority from him and
giving it to
his children god's children
so the devil does not have authority
anymore that's why we can confidently
say he is a loser he can try to fight
all he wants he can try to attack all he
wants but he is a loser
no matter what
he's still fighting though but the thing
that he is fighting for
is for you to give him authority is for
you to do what adam and eve did this is
why it's so important for you to have
this revelation i have authority in
christ over the devil the devil doesn't
have authority over
me i am the winner through christ every
single day of my life we are in a
spiritual war every day and we can win
every single day but we need to actually
show up to battle to see the victory
happen
you can't be a champion without being a
warrior who laces up their shoes and
goes into the race that's why it says in
this passage in ephesians 6 be strong in
the lord don't relax on the couch in
life
but be strong realize you're in a battle
and let's go to work in the spiritual
realm it says put on all god's armor so
you will be able to stand
firm against all the strategies of the
devil so the devil has all of these
sneaky strategies and all these
strategies this the goal is simple the
devil is the father of lies so he is
lying to you
hoping you will not know this fact i
shared with you that you have authority
over him he's lying to you
hoping that you will be too lazy and not
use your authority over
him
you have to show up to this race you
have to show up to the war and use this
supernatural
weapons the the sword of the spirit put
on the supernatural protection the armor
of god
to defeat the devil the devil knows that
a lot of christians are ignorant and do
not know what is their right as a child
of god the devil knows that a lot of
christians don't know that healing
freedom protection abundant life is
theirs and the devil cannot steal it as
long as they execute their authority and
protect what is theirs
the devil knows it so this is his
strategy to come with these lies lies of
sickness lies of pain lies of lack lies
of anxiety lies of depression he'll
bring them they can manifest physically
these attacks they can come in your mind
they can come in your dreams they can
come in circumstances but you need to
understand that when you see these
attacks
these are weapons
formed against you but the bible says
that no weapon formed against you shall
prosper when you start to see these
attacks come in your life
know that you have authority to stop
these attacks these attacks
do not mean
loss in your life
when you get a diagnosis it does not
mean
oh no the devil won
this attack on my life and i have cancer
now you need to understand that these
weapons formed against you do not need
to prosper you can stop them from
prospering
but you actually have to take action you
have to use your authority to keep these
weapons from against you from prospering
submit yourselves therefore to god
meaning submit yourself to god's will
take his word seriously and do what it
says
believe that by his stripes you're
healed believe the abundant life is your
inheritance believe that you have
authority over the devil
and do what the word of god says
in order to claim this inheritance and
walk in it it's all over the word of god
directions on how to do this the word of
god is so valuable it is not just words
but it literally carries instructions
of how to walk in authority how to see
god's abundant life manifest in your
life
and how to win over the devil every time
how the action of resisting him and
rejecting him and seeing him flee
the word of god is like a blueprint to
walk in an abundant life but you need to
be reading the word of god with true
revelation of the holy spirit not on a
religious way or not reading it as this
is just words i need to read my bible so
i'm just reading right through it but
reading it with revelation
this kind of revelation i'm telling you
right now that these are the words that
lead to true
life
and here's an example james 4 7 submit
yourselves therefore to god resist the
devil and he will flee from you
so you have to submit yourself to god
number one and then number two you need
to resist the devil
resist the devil is an action word
resist the devil is actually an action
word of authority
if you think about
teachers they're in a place of authority
they step into the classroom knowing
that they have authority there that the
children don't have authority over them
they walk with that revelation and they
execute that authority sometimes they
need to speak up and they need to speak
with a firm voice
and
tell the children to stop misbehaving a
president knows he's in a place of
authority so if there's
attacks from other nations he knows it's
his responsibility he can do something
about these attacks these attacks do not
have to
prosper
he can go make a law execute an order
and things really happen and the country
is protected and the enemies are stopped
but the president has to know his place
of authority and actually execute his
authority you need to see yourself as a
person of authority over the devil
that's part of your identity in christ
and many christians are not walking in
this revelation when you don't execute
your authority the devil will just take
advantage of it the devil will just
steal it and he'll be the one in charge
throughout the word of god there's many
examples of
how we're supposed to execute this
authority and we're going to look at
some of these resist the devil and he
will flee from you is one of them to
resist the devil that's executing your
authority
it means the devil is trying to lie to
you the devil is coming with this attack
but he has no authority to win in this
attack you need to resist him though
if you are not resisting the devil
that's the action of accepting him
that's the action of allowing him to
come and continue his attack and this is
where we see
people who now have yokes in their lives
weapons were formed against them
but they
just let them come at them they let them
prosper and when you do that that's the
action of opening the door
and allowing that weapon to prosper and
to just come on inside
and you start to see now
the devil's portion over your life in
certain areas and you might wonder why
how did this happen
in in many cases it's because you were
not executing your authority and you
ended up actually just letting the devil
take over and having authority over you
so the bible says resist the devil and
he will flee from you it's really as
simple as that because you have
authority
when you resist him
it's a spiritual law
he's forced to flee just like how the
police are in a place of authority
and they
when those lights go on the siren behind
your car
you have to pull over there's no arguing
it when you resist the devil as much as
the devil will love to he cannot argue
it
he must obey your authority and he has
to flee
we really need to
see ourselves differently
there's many parts to our identity in
christ
we are children of god
we have a father who takes care of us
our life is in his hands
but we are also the spiritually mature
child of god yes but warrior
who has authority in christ paul
actually calls timothy a good
soldier paul also says
fight the good fight we need to stop
seeing ourselves as just mere christians
when we see ourselves as just mere
christians
church goers just going through the
motions of reading the bible and showing
up to church and praying
we end up being like civilian christians
god said let them have dominion not let
them just be church goers who have no
power so you need to start seeing
yourself as this warrior of christ and
you must stand firm in your place of
authority over the devil always we
demolish arguments and every pretension
that sets itself up against the
knowledge of god and we take captive
every thought to make it obedient to
christ
so this is speaking about how to have
authority over the devil in your mind
this is a big way that the devil is
coming with the weapons lying to you
trying to make you forget your authority
so he will lie to you he can lie to you
and say you should be so afraid god
doesn't really love you you're far away
from god he can lie to you and say
you're not going to make it you're going
to stay poor you're going to die
the sickness is not going away god gives
us this direction of how to take
authority and have victory over the
devil's schemes in your mind so it says
we demolish arguments and every
pretension that sets itself up against
the knowledge of god so this is this
other place where you need to take
action you need to use your authority
you need to be aware in your mind what
is not of god
the thoughts running around in your mind
do they align with the word of god do
they align with god's character and
heart
if not
that's the devil so you need to use your
authority and demolish those arguments
those lies and you need to take them
captive every thought and make it
obedient to christ
so
when i read this passage it reminds me
of police i think about police how
they're taking criminals
captive
they have a job and they're taking it
seriously and they are protecting lives
of people let's say someone is driving
recklessly speeding so they are they're
not going to let that person get away
with that they're going to arrest them
and they're going to take that person
captive they are very serious about
their job and they have authority to
take that person captive
we need to see ourselves like this like
police men and women
over our mind
this mind must be a place
where god's will remains it is a sound
mind it must be a mind full of peace and
joy
and god's thoughts and words only
no other voice is allowed to stay
so
you need to be your own policeman or
woman in your mind and you need to
patrol
you need to be aware do not let thoughts
just
go on and have their way in your mind
when you do that that is not resisting
the devil and that's the action of
allowing them to stay so if you
recognize thoughts that are not of god
lies of the devil
lies about who you are
who god is and
god's plan for your life you need to
reject them and take them captive
you need to make it known to the devil
that he cannot stay there that you will
not tolerate the lies to remain so how
do you effectively reject every lie and
maintain
god's will in your mind well you first
need to meditate on god's word read his
word this is where you get to know his
voice where you get to know
what his will is what his heart is this
is how you can discern between the
devil's lies and god's voice
in the word of god you'll learn that god
never gives you a spirit of fear but he
actually gives you power love and a
sound mind jesus has provided perfect
peace for you
so that means that chaos stress
fear
in your mind that's not of god jesus
provided healing for you so if you have
thoughts i'm sick i'm gonna get sick i
might inherit this disease it's in my
family line sickness is not god's will
those are lies of the devil god has
forgiven your sins and he sees you as
the righteousness of god he never
condemns you it says there's no
condemnation for those who are in christ
jesus so the voice of god is never going
to be shame
judgment condemnation these are just
some examples but this is why it's so
important you to read the word of god on
your own
for you to fully
know god's voice and his will and be so
sharp to be able to discern the devil's
lies versus god's truth so when there's
a certain lie of the devil that's going
around in your mind
you need to look at the word of god and
say what does the word of god say
according to this so if it's fear you're
feeling so much fear about something
specifically look to the word of god
where it talks about fear one example is
is that god did not give me a spirit of
fear but of power love and a sound
mind it also says that those who keep
their eyes on jesus will have perfect
peace
perfect peace is actually part of the
inheritance that jesus provided for you
on the cross meaning it's yours the
devil can't take it you really have this
inheritance of remaining in perfect
peace all the time
so as you read the word of god as you
analyze is this a crime in my mind you
know yes it is you find yes this is a
crime this is the devil's lie
you become like a policeman now uh-uh
you cannot stay what you should do is
first meditate on the word of god get
that truth in you in your heart and then
you can speak because there's power the
bible says the power of life and death
is in your tongue when you speak
this is a big way to execute your
authority so you can speak
fear must leave me
you can say it however you want you can
expand on it it doesn't matter exactly
how you say it but you need to basically
say fear get out
fear you can't stay
every spirit of fear must go every lie
of fear must go however you want to say
it i reject every lie of fear and so
that's you resisting the devil
so he must flee from you
and then begin to speak god's word over
your life
begin to prophesy this is how you're
bringing down god's inheritance of
perfect peace you're you're bringing it
down you're speaking words of life
you're speaking your authority you're
saying the devil's will can't stay it
must go
god's will must come so you can speak
god has given me
a sound mind i look to you jesus right
now renew your mind that jesus is with
you always visualize that he's looking
at you right now it's the truth he is
so
open your spiritual eyes by activating
your faith
meditate jesus is here with me right now
i look in your eyes right now you don't
have to see them in the physical realm
you don't have to have a vision but
you're looking in his eyes in the
spiritual realm by putting your faith
there that he is looking at you
you receive his eyes of love looking at
you his eyes of peace perfect peace
looking at you the bible says those who
keep their focus on me i will keep in
perfect peace
so just close your eyes and just look to
jesus just
spend some time just focusing on jesus
talking to him worshiping him
receiving from him being in his presence
and now you're accessing that perfect
peace the bible says you do have to
focus on jesus
to be walking in this perfect peace to
be staying in this perfect peace so make
sure you're getting to that place of
looking to him
focusing on him you will experience the
perfect piece of jesus coming upon you
dwelling in you replacing in your mind
the spirits of fear
this is what we should do in every area
of our life every area that the devil is
trying to attack the way to see the
devil lose and to have victory
is to walk in your authority to execute
it properly we are called to have
authority over all demonic powers in
this world as the body of christ
so
we are all given authority as soon as
you give your life to jesus but there's
different levels of authority
and the levels increase as you
effectively walk in authority that god's
given you
according to his will that you take it
seriously
that you do it according to god's will
that authority god will increase in you
it is the authority that jesus has given
us that makes demons to go
it's because we have authority over them
through christ
this is one of the biggest reasons why
we don't see many believers casting out
demons today in the body of christ
it's because they aren't walking in
authority at all they aren't walking in
authority over their own spiritual lives
so how could god increase their
authority to cast out demons how could
demons even take them seriously when
they're not taking authority over their
own spiritual life if you want to cast
out demons if you're praying for that
you have to start here you need to first
be this victorious warrior in your own
spiritual life before god can entrust
you with more authority to be dealing
with higher levels of demonic powers so
now that you know you have authority
it's time to live in this
every day renew your mind as you wake up
in the morning
i have authority over the devil today
over every strategy that comes my way
i'm going to execute my authority and
the devil must obey as i execute that
authority over him i'm going to show you
right now an example of what walking in
authority over the devil looks like
demons do not stand a chance when we
walk in our authority in christ every
demon here your time is up i declare you
to go

authority over every scheme of the devil
you are victorious over the devil every
single day you are not lazy but you are
strong you are empowered by the holy
spirit and you are a man or woman of
true authority in christ
demons must obey you in jesus name i
speak this anointing to come upon you
now
and fill you with new levels of
anointing and authority
i declare that the devil would see you
differently from today that he would be
afraid of you that he would know he's in
trouble
because he cannot get away with anything
from today
you are executing authority over him and
you will have the victory over him every
single day from today in jesus name i
execute the authority that jesus has
given me now over all demonic powers in
you and i declare every demonic power
holding you back from walking in
authority must go i declare every spirit
of religion
every lie of the devil that makes you
feel insecurity and weak
and not like a good enough christian i
command all of those lies to go in jesus
name
i declare every spirit messing with your
mind and keeping you from reading the
word keeping you from spending time with
god and keeping you from focusing when
you read god's word i declare all those
spirits to go in jesus name i declare
you will read the word of god and you
will get revelation from the holy spirit
you will hear god's voice and i declare
the fire of the holy spirit to fill you
now with a hunger for god's word with a
hunger to obey god with a fire for jesus
and to be in his perfect will in jesus
name
