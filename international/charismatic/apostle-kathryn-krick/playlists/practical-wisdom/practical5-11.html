0:07
God anointing what we are called to do
0:10
is
0:11

0:14
others freely you have been given freely
0:18

0:20
Bible says so our job is purely to

0:31
and the truth that saved us that opened
0:33
our eyes the anointing to release that
0:37

0:38
people we have to protect that we can
0:41

anointing Above All Else guard your
0:49
heart from everything you do flows from
0:51
it guard your heart above all else for
0:54
it determines the course of your
0:57
life so it's very important
1:00
to not let the devil bring you
1:06
down
1:08
this revival is the most exciting thing
1:12
in the entire world what God is doing
1:16
what he's about to do what he has done
1:19
what he's doing in this revival what
1:20
he's about to do is the most exciting
1:23
thing in the whole
1:25
world and it's like the greatest victory
1:28
that the body of Christ has seen in
1:31
generations and
1:33
generations which is therefore the most
1:35
Victory and joy that we personally have
1:39
seen in our whole lives this is the most
1:42
exciting thing this is more exciting
1:44
than all of your worldly dreams coming
1:47
true not worldly in a bad way but like I
1:50
don't know your your dream of a career
1:52
your dream to have love and have
1:54
children and a house and whatever these
1:57
good beautiful dreams it's it's even
1:59
more exciting that all of them coming
2:01
true if you're spiritual you you realize
2:04
how exciting this is how how eternity
2:08
changing this is changing the whole
2:12
world this is making history in heaven
2:16
hallelujah hallelujah this is great
2:18
victory over the devil after so many
2:22
generations he's he's had this
2:24
stronghold of religion it's victory time
2:28
Hallelujah and so our lives should be
2:32
full of zeal passion excitement
2:35
joy for all that Jesus is in our own
2:39
personal lives but also like
2:41
specifically what he's doing like this
2:44
revival the the the the millions of
2:48
souls that will be saved healed
2:49
delivered and millions of of Believers
2:52
who've been stuck in bondage and stuck
2:54
in a lukewarm life because they've never
2:56
encountered the power of God their eyes
2:57
will open up they will encounter God's
2:59
power this is so exciting so really like
3:03
the spiritual way to be is to live every
3:05
day in this joy and excitement and
3:09
Zeal every day like that's how we should
3:12
live and that's living in the truth and
3:16
the more we live this way the more God
3:19
can use us the more that there is inside
3:21
of us to release guard your heart for
3:24
whatever you do flows from it and this
3:27
is this is not that complicated to
3:29
understand if you are down if you are
3:31
thinking about dark things if your mind
3:34
is set on negative things you will not
3:37
have much
3:38
energy you will not have much joy and if
3:40
you have to go be joyous and loving to
3:43
someone it's a huge effort and you
3:46
absolutely would not be able to to pour
3:48
out what you could have if you had your
3:50
mindset on good things and you and you
3:53
had joy and energy because of what you
3:55
were doing in the spiritual
3:57
realm you you know this you experienced
4:00
this it's not mind-blowing what I'm
4:02
saying but this is this is powerful this
4:06
is wild to think about that we get to
4:09
choose how much God can use us we get to
4:12
choose how how much can flow from us and
4:16
Advance God's kingdom by what we are
4:20
meditating
4:21
on by how we are choosing to guard our
4:25
heart and so you got to realize I've
4:28
seen this in my own life you you have to
4:30
realize that the devil is after your
4:33
heart like he's trying to bring he's
4:37
trying to bring down the excitement he's
4:38
trying to bring sadness he's trying to
4:40
bring depression he's trying to bring
4:42
attention towards what he's doing you
4:45
have to always remember that he will
4:46
lose always no matter how scary it looks
4:49
no matter how scary the Pharisees look
4:53
no matter how much they're painting you
4:54
in a bad light or something the devil
4:57
will always lose always we have a
5:00
guaranteed Victory it's not like on
5:02
Earth we don't really know who's going
5:03
to win the race we know we have the
5:06
victory
5:08
Hallelujah okay
5:10
so grasp this reality grasp the
5:13
spiritual truth it is stupid it is not
5:17
smart it is not wise at all it is
5:21
foolish to believe the lies of the
5:26
devil to let his attacks against the
5:30
anointing and you get you
5:32
down that's
5:34
foolish because it's not it it it's
5:37
there's no point to
5:39
it there's no point to it it does
5:42
nothing for you it does nothing for you
5:44
for good to worry for no reason you have
5:47
the
5:50
victory there's so much good to focus on
5:53
there's so much work of God to focus on
5:55
there's so much God wants you to be
5:57
doing to focus on instead of that
6:00
so be aware of this scheme be aware of
6:02
the scheme of the devil to deceive you
6:05
to distract you and to destroy your
6:10
heart beware of these schemes to deceive
6:13
you to distract you and to destroy the
6:17
peace and joy in your
6:19
heart these are the main schemes of the
6:23
enemy against the anointed ones against
6:28
those doing the work of God and
6:32
destroying
6:34
religion all right so be aware of these
6:38
things and I I speak this
6:41
prophetically because the more the move
6:44
of God Goes Forth the the the more Angry
6:50
the devil
6:51
gets be expectant but don't be troubled
6:55
by attacks be expectant for them say oh
6:57
of course of course this is the sign
7:00
we're doing powerful things this is the
7:01
sign of great Victory Hallelujah and the
7:04
devil's going to lose again this attack
7:06
the devil will not win
