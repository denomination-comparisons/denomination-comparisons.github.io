0:00
God lives in this body and so we
0:01
shouldn't just be living however we want
0:05
but we should live with that intention
0:06
it's the same thing as if the house was
0:08
like a mess and Jesus was coming over to
0:10
stay at your house you would get the
0:12
best house cleaner to help you I mean
0:14
you would work so hard to make sure that
0:17
when Jesus came he felt comfortable and
0:19
it wasn't dirty it wasn't sloppy but it
0:21
would be clean and nice and so Holy
0:24
Spirit lives in us we should care for
0:27
our Temple for that house that God lives
0:29
in so that it's healthy so that it's
0:31
functioning well you don't need to
0:33
unnecessarily eat things you hate do
0:35
what you need to do to be eating healthy
0:37
look for protein on the plate and
0:40
vegetables have fruit just make sure
0:42
you're eating a balanced meal and you're
0:45
being intentional about it it's okay to
0:47
have sweets sometimes but it's not okay
0:50
to lack self-control it's not okay when
0:53
you have a sugar addiction and you're
0:55
feeding it so when you're noticing that
0:57
you're needing to have sugar several
0:59
times a day that's an indicator that
1:01
there's a sugar addiction and so
1:04
renounce it and start having
1:06
self-discipline just because it's
1:08
offered to you you can have self-d
1:09
discipline and not take it it's okay to
1:11
have sometimes but it's about moderation
1:14
and it's just so important that you're
1:16
not doing it because you're like I just
1:18
want it I just have to have it eating
1:20
well you'll find that you'll feel better
1:22
and even eating it once you start doing
1:24
it you'll find you you'll eat something
1:26
and you you feel like this is healthy
1:29
and this is good for my body and you
1:31
feel good but then when you eat
1:33
something bad you already feel like oh
1:36
this is not good for my this is not good
1:38
for me you all of you starts to feel it
1:40
just start making the intention making
1:42
the intention and be smart about it with
1:46
finding things you enjoy you become
1:48
transformed you become transformed just
1:50
it's it's it's a s it's the same
1:52
principle of doing anything for God at
1:55
first it's hard at first it's difficult
1:57
at first it's a stretch at first your
1:59
flesh is strong wrong but the more Godly
2:01
you become you actually desire you
2:04
naturally desire to do these Godly
2:05
things and you don't desire to do the
2:07
things of the world at all that you used
2:09
to desire so you need to just start
2:11
taking that step make that intention so
2:15
God can transform you
