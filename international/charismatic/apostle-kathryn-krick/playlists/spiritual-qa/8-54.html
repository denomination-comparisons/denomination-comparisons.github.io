can discernment be perverted by jealousy 100%
0:06
absolutely the Bible says that the pure in heart shall see God the pure in heart shall see God so the pure in heart shall
0:13
hear God's voice seeing God also means hearing God's voice recognizing what he
0:18
is speaking recognizing whom he is speaking through whom he is moving
0:24
through recognizing his Works recognizing his miracles his
0:30
deliverances his healings um that's also the meaning of
0:36
seeing God seeing God means all of these things and so um when it comes to
0:44
Discerning different people if they are if whether it's um leaders or whether
0:52
it's people of influence whether it's people who don't have really a big influence but are believers
1:00
everyone has their own opinions people speak different things so when you have
1:07
a pure heart this is how you have the right discernment this is how you can recognize this is God speaking this is a
1:14
work from God Etc so for example if it's just um any believer and they are
1:21
speaking something you can discern if this is God behind what they are speaking or not as you grow in wisdom
1:28
and discernment you can see God in someone or not you
1:34
know you can see like if this person is really walking with the Lord or not you
1:40
can see if this person is in you know following that voice of
1:46
religion is more like a Pharisee or if they have a pure heart
1:51
and are truly following the spirit of God um and then also when it comes to
1:57
Discerning leaders in the body of Christ Discerning Ministries Discerning um good
2:03
fruits versus versus bad fruits is God really with this person is this really the work of Jesus when you have a pure
2:09
heart you will have discernment the pure in heart shall see God so how to have real discernment from God you need to
2:16
have a pure heart what's an impure heart a heart that has selfish ambition so an
2:21
impure heart is a heart that has selfish ambition a heart that has um Pride a
2:26
heart that has jealousy that is an impure heart a heart that has
2:34
hatred a heart that wants bad for somebody
2:39
um a heart that is selfish so when you
2:44
have those things that's an impure heart the pure in heart shall see God the pure
2:50
in heart shall have discernment shall really hear God leading you shall recognize where God is recognize his
2:57
voice um but the devil is the ultimate deceiver
3:04
deceit comes through lies that's how deceit comes so he the devil tries to manipulate people with his lies he tries
3:12
to deceive people by his lies so what happens is when you are allowing these
3:17
things in your heart it's like you are agreeing with the
3:24
Enemy I mean if you are keeping these things in your heart these impure keeping now
3:30
we all are in a spiritual war where the devil can put thoughts in our mind
3:36
jealous thoughts hatred thoughts selfish ambition thoughts but we have the choice
3:42
to reject them or to keep them we have that choice we have that
3:47
Authority and so when we reject them when we say ew I don't want that thought of jealousy I don't want jealousy in me
3:54
I don't want to be jealous about somebody or ew I don't want selfish ambition in me I don't want self
3:59
selfishness in me this this strong desire I have all of a sudden now of
4:04
selfish ambition I don't want that in me ew no I reject it when you do that you
4:11
are disagreeing with the devil you are saying I do not want to be
4:18
a part of you devil I do not want your influence in my life I don't want your voice in my ear um I don't want any part
4:27
of you I I don't want any part of your agenda I don't want any part of your
4:33
heart of your impure heart devil that's what you're saying okay and you're saying I want God's heart I want God's
4:41
agenda I want God's plan I want God's will I want to be Godly um when you reject these lies of
4:50
the devil these thoughts of impurities when you reject them okay so the thing
4:55
is is that a lot of people they are not reject ing these things they they are
5:02
not rejecting the jealous
5:09
thought you know they they they see somebody jealousy jealous come jealous
5:15
thought comes and they they stew on it they feed it they accept
5:22
it when they do that this can be selfish ambition too they you want something
5:29
you're thinking about it how much you want something in a selfish way um you're thinking on it thinking on
5:35
you're accepting it and then that's becoming even more in you okay so the more you're ex like not
5:44
rejecting the devil's thoughts the devil's lies the more you are going to his
5:53
side he's the ultimate deceiver I've heard the story this a
5:59
Satanist say an ex Satanist say how the devil would tell him like I'll give you
6:05
love I'll give I'll love you and that was part of the reason why this person
6:11
would follow the devil is because this person didn't have that from like parent
6:16
parents growing up um and so we believe the devil's lies so you have people like this that
6:24
are just living in deceit you have people like this that don't start out blat wanting to do evil but they listen
6:34
to The Devil's lies they accept the devil's lies and then they become in they they start to live in deceit they
6:40
they start because to hear God is it you know is not just for
6:46
everybody you have to make the choice to hear God you have to make the choice to be spiritual you have to make the choice
6:53
to be strong spiritually reject the devil's lies and be so adamant so
6:58
surrendered so obedient I want God's will over my life completely I want to be completely obedient to God you have
7:05
to be so serious about that and when you do that your spiritual ears open to hear
7:10
God's voice you are giving permission for God to reveal himself to you and he becomes
7:17
revealed to you his ways become revealed you have understanding you remember how Jesus would teach in Parables and he
7:23
would teach when he was teaching his disciples he would one time he was saying like these Pharisees they have
7:29
ears but they don't hear so I could teach and teach and teach and teach and spend so much time trying to teach them
7:34
but they will never hear they will never hear they will never really hear what
7:39
I'm saying and so he's saying that this is the Pharisees Choice it doesn't matter what I speak it doesn't matter
7:46
how much I try to explain it they will never be able to hear me because of their choice to not hear
7:52
me so it it's a choice to be able to have ears that can hear God eyes that
7:58
can see God the pure in heart shall see God it's a choice to be pure so if you make the
8:05
choice to keep on allowing impurity in your heart um you're you're what you're
8:12
doing is you're opening the door and giving excess to the devil to feed you more and more and more lies and
8:19
now when he spoke the lies before you wanted them I don't mean you but I'm saying
8:25
like when people do not reject certain lies like this like jealousy selfish ambition Pride when they don't reject
8:32
those lies they're they're they're wanting them they they are wanting them
8:40
technically they are technically wanting they're technically wanting to not be pure like that's their
8:48
choice so they're they're actually in the spiritual realm technically they're saying I want the devil to speak to me
8:55
and I want the devil's lies to be truth I want the devil lies to be my truth like I
9:00
think this is true I think this is right I think this is um good this is what I
9:06
want is the devil's lies like that's what that's what they're saying as an action of keeping hanging on to the
9:14
devil's lies and not rejecting them and so they start to go in this place of
9:20
Deceit they start to go in this place of Deceit and they can go further and further down this rabbit hole and this
9:27
is where you have people that are so sure of things um but they're completely
9:32
wrong they're saying thus says the Lord God has sent me to do this and it's doing a work of the devil
9:38
actually it's it's bringing destruction um it's trying to divide
9:44
God's Kingdom for example people can be so adamant and sure of sounding sure and confident of this but it's because
9:51
they've accepted the voice of the enemy and this has just become their lifestyle
9:56
this has become their Doctrine now this has become there what they think
10:02
is good the good thing to do for their life you know so to answer the question
10:07
can um what was the question can jealousy Cloud discernment I think it was
10:12
something like that pervert discernment yeah absolutely like the
10:18
more we are are are stand firm to accept God's truth only the more we have
10:24
Crystal Clear discernment the more we can accurately hear God's voice
10:30
and then the opposite is true so that's why it's so important for believers to
10:35
um recognize this truth and not just listen to anybody that says thus says the Lord and says that God has sent me
10:43
to do this and you know it's so important because you need to know as a Believer there are those who are
10:48
surrendered to God and there are those who are not there are those who are pure and have chosen
10:54
Purity and have done the steps to choose Purity they've rejected the devil's Liv they've picked up their cross they've
11:00
surrendered and there are those who do not there are those who have chose the path of lukewarm there are those who
11:06
have chose to not reject the devil's lies there are those who have chosen um
11:11
the impure way the impure heart so important you realize that so that you
11:16
don't get confused or deceived um out of people's confidence
11:22
or Zeal just like Saul who became Paul look how zealous Saul was that the
11:27
followers of Jesus deserve to be killed that they were Blasphemous they were Heretics they were false prophets look
11:34
how zealous he was right but he was completely wrong his eyes were completely
11:40
shut Jesus opened up his eyes and he repented and he became Apostle
11:47
Paul I've had freedom from so much Hallelujah but I'm still struggling with anger and irritability especially when
11:53
I'm weak in a weakened place from sickness lack of sleep or hormones how
11:59
do I have
12:09
victur I first want to say that we need to have you need to have Grace for
12:15
yourself as a human as a human when we are tired like
12:24
when we've been through really hard things
12:31
you know we are not really ourselves
12:36
sometimes ourselves is who we are our true self is who you
12:41
are um on a good day on a good day when you are
12:49
um when you are full of energy when you are full of joy when Lots when you're
12:55
not passing through a storm when you know when things just all these
13:03
horrible things aren't like happening to you or something like the way you are
13:09
just so excited to like praise God and you you just you just feel so zealous to
13:18
love on people and you just have so much natural energy and strength the way you are like that
13:25
that's that's the real you that's the real you and
13:32
um God really spoke this to me one day and it really helped free me from
13:39
condemnation and helped me to be more confident in God's love for me and who I
13:45
am in Christ it it it it helped me be more confident in my love for God as well
13:54
because like on I would notice that on mountaintops
13:59
I naturally just like wanted to shout on rooftops about God's faithfulness and his goodness and then um in valleys or
14:10
in in hard waiting Seasons I still loved God so much and I still was obeying him
14:17
and serving him but I didn't feel like the same exact way as I did on mountain
14:22
tops inside I didn't have this like wild
14:27
energy um of like praise praise praise but I was choosing to praise God I was choosing to
14:33
love God I was choosing to be obedient but I didn't have as much is like that wild enthusiasm and I remember I would
14:41
see these patterns and then one time the Lord really spoke to me and he said the
14:46
real you is you on a good day you know don't like the the the that Zeal that
14:54
passion that fire that's the real you and so on other days where you don't feel feel that way naturally don't see
15:01
yourself as like oh this is who I am now or this is who I've become or something
15:07
um or I've lost my fire don't see yourself that way um have Grace and
15:14
understanding that you're going through hard things and you're a human Jesus was sweating blood in the Garden of
15:21
Gethsemane um and this was before he went on the cross this was just
15:27
like going through the person ution that he was at that time and just knowing how
15:32
Judas betrayed him and knowing prophetically what was to
15:37
come that's a lot he was going through that's a lot that was going on in his
15:44
mind it's a lot and so he was sweating
15:49
blood because like of of this heaviness um before even he was being
15:57
scored whipped in the prison um and put on the cross it
16:03
was before that you know that he was going he was really in a valley and
16:08
going through such intense time where because he's a he's a human he was
16:15
um he was sweating he was um sweating blood
16:21
uh and saying Lord take this cup if you can but above all let your will be done
16:27
so that was like a human moment and he there's nothing wrong with that prayer because he said above all let your will
16:34
be done he was just being real like this is difficult and I would prefer to not
16:40
do this but but but but above what I prefer let your will be done so that day
16:46
was different than a day where the will of God is fun and you're like preaching to everyone like the will of God is the
16:53
best thing in the whole world look at how God's blessed me like that day of
17:00
preaching is very different than that day in the Garden of Gethsemane you know
17:07
and um so like I what I I say that to say is that
17:14
like you need to First have Grace on yourself in terms of the feelings Department
17:21
um and just have Grace on yourself when things are tough when things are hard um
17:28
God has for you Jesus went through these hard things he has compassion he has
17:33
understanding the reason why I'm first saying that it's important you have Grace because that's an important step
17:40
to to grow stronger to even be Christlike in your weaknesses to be
17:46
Christlike still when you're tired or when things are hard that you can still make the choice to be
17:52
Christlike you have to first be so grounded in God's love for you and seeing yourself rightly
17:59
um and also like in those times of weakness to know God's with you and he
18:06
understands and he has compassion for you and he's going to help you still be obedient to him still um serve serve him
18:14
well and represent him well to be looking at him rightly like that that's
18:20
how you gain the the power and the strength um and so to make that it's
18:26
important to make that intention to make that practice when you find it's like a a weakness day
18:33
or you're really tired or things are hard that you in the morning like in the
18:38
beginning of the day if you're just going through something just recognize I need more of God's help
18:45
today to be obedient completely to be Christlike to represent him well and so
18:51
Lord I Look to You and I ask you to help me and I receive your power your strength and my life and I know I can do
18:57
all things through you who strengthens me um that's how you can can gain that
19:05
strength and um and to not see that that that God's
19:12
just like looking at you judging or something because that's what happens sometimes in weakness places maybe a
19:18
mistake happens maybe you're not like you don't respond as Christlike as
19:23
usually um and what the enemy will want to do will some many times do is bring condemnation
19:30
and what what what's not good to do is to allow that voice of condemnation to
19:36
just continue to show up anytime there's a a time of weakness because then it'll just be like a spiral
19:43
by listening to the voice of condemnation you're doing the opposite of turning to God's voice and hearing his voice of love hearing his voice of
19:49
compassion and understanding and being proud of you so um whatever area it is
19:56
that you find your a weakness in still and and then when when there's those weak days you you find that you are not
20:03
Christlike or you make a mistake in this area you sin in this area renounce that
20:08
renounce you know renounce that you know on on hard days that I give this sin or
20:15
I give into this I renounce that and that will not happen again because I believe and I receive that God
20:23
is with me and I receive his help I receive his strength um and so it's it's really just
20:30
having that belief that that you can do it that God can help you and rejecting the devil's lies and making that
20:36
intention being proactive about it how to be more consistent I feel like
20:41
sometimes I don't reject lies quick enough because I don't even realize they're there for a minute like if I'm
20:46
focused on something else like listening to a teaching um well as long as you're
20:54
focused on God and like listening if you're listening to a teaching and you feel like you didn't reject a lie after
21:00
like it was there for a minute it's okay you know you don't it you don't need to feel like religious
21:06
about it or or like you like there's something you have to attain of perfection um when I say reject those
21:14
lies I'm not saying like you have to reject them the second you hear them I
21:21
mean yeah reject them the second you hear them but it's not something like if
21:26
it took you one minute for until you rejected it you've lost the battle no no
21:31
no no no no no no no no no no no no no because um I mean it's it's really powerful to
21:39
reject the LIE whether it's the second it pops in your head or if you were just
21:45
focused on focused on a teaching for example that's a beautiful good thing and you realize a minute later oh that's
21:51
a lie you reject it then that the the important thing is like once you have
21:57
that revelation This Is A Lie reject it reject it that's
22:03
the important thing you know it's so important that you don't um be turning in
22:11
this walk of a walking Dominion walk of authority life that we're doing as
22:18
something religious you know it's important that you don't turn in you know it's important you don't turn the new wine teachings to old wine it's
22:27
important you don't allow the enemy to try to infiltrate that in to the
22:34
teachings you know it's so important you you abide by this understanding of God's
22:40
grace of God's love of God's compassion and that he's not a religious
22:46
like dictator and just watching over you with like a like a judge um have you
22:52
done this perfectly um but he's looking at the heart so important you abide by
22:57
that thinking how do we act polite when we know the enemy is speaking through
23:03
someone I usually reject it in my mind is this enough um yeah I mean if you are in a place where I don't know like the
23:09
workplace or maybe with family you're an area where you're just like close to people who are speaking um by the enemy
23:18
enemy speaking through them um just renew your mind to see them with Jesus's eyes to see that they are a beloved
23:24
child of God they truly are to have God's heart for them remember how Saul
23:30
was transformed to Paul so to have that those eyes that perspective that even
23:35
though this person is allowing the enemy to use them right now God still has a
23:40
plan for their life if they choose it God still wants to save them redeem them and even use them mightily in the
23:47
kingdom of God that's God's plan for their life so I will choose to have this perspective of love for this person and
23:55
um Renewing Your Mind of how we are called to love our enemies um so you
24:02
know just renew your mind in these times if you're if this is a struggle if this is hard like in the moment renew your
24:08
mind with these things and that will help you to number one
24:13
just not speaking negative words towards them uh and to be able to be loving to
24:21
them still being polite when repenting is it important to
24:27
apologize to the person you sinned against or is it more about your changed heart posture towards
24:34
God so this just depends on the situation basically if you have hurt
24:40
somebody if you've caused damage to somebody you should apologize to them
24:45
because this will help bring healing to them you know
24:50
um you know I mean if you are used if if you did spoke a negative word you know
24:58
about somebody or just did a negative action towards someone that can cause hurt that can
25:05
cause pain that can cause um stumbling block sometimes for
25:12
somebody it can be a trauma um sometimes the enemy can move
25:18
through trauma and bring oppression you know and so it's important to not take
25:25
lightly uh if you've caused some sort of harm to another person one negative word
25:32
can really the enemy can really move through one negative word many times you know somebody's not
25:40
trying to be used by the enemy and they really love God but they speak a Nega they choose to speak a negative word and
25:45
the enemy hops on it and the enemy really uses that and you don't know what's going on in
25:51
the other person's life maybe that word really the enemy really worked hard
25:57
through that word and um cause struggle in their life through that word
26:03
insecurity uh fear things like this
26:08
so when you realize like if if this was you like if you caused harm to somebody
26:14
any way in any way you spoke negatively to somebody
26:19
um the action you made was negative when you realize that and you feel sorry and you repent
26:27
you should AP oliz to them so it can bring healing to them so that the
26:32
enemy's lies can be exposed and rejected out of their life because maybe there's
26:37
maybe you know that negative word the enemy's really tried to push on them that like it's true you know and so just
26:45
that word of apology um can really free them can do a
26:52
big a great huge thing in the spiritual realm for that person
26:58
so um and and then this is another side note like if there's some people that
27:04
speak negatively online about people say things that are not true say things that are judgmental
27:10
um say things about ministers Ministries negatively online um that aren't true that are
27:18
judgmental and so God is absolutely 100% calling that
27:24
person to repent publicly and to say that they were wrong publicly and to
27:30
apologize publicly because that will help help it's the
27:36
same principle it will help uh clear the damage that was caused by The Lies by
27:43
the negative words help people to know the truth see the
27:48
truth um and so yeah so that's the one side but then if you have been thinking
27:56
negatively about somebody you know maybe it was like jealousy and
28:03
the the devil came and and
28:08
um was trying to make you jealous of somebody and you didn't reject those those thought those thoughts but if you
28:16
never acted on those thoughts you you you don't necessarily have to like tell the person that can
28:22
just be something you repent before God because it it was just there in your heart and didn't
28:29
come out but many times when we keep things in our heart for a while the Bible says that what's in your heart
28:35
it'll come out of your mouth so sometimes
28:40
um you know if a person is thinking negatively about somebody in their heart they'll start to act negatively towards
28:46
that person so in that case you know you should apologize you can also share I was dealing with thoughts from the devil
28:53
about you and I wasn't rejecting them and it was causing me to like treat you wrongly so I apologize and I repent and
29:00
I reject those lies of the devil and this is who you are and confess the truth about who they are you can do that
29:07
um you know you don't have to like go into all like these huge details if that's the case of things in your heart
29:13
that you if you didn't act on all the things that you know were going on in your heart but maybe if it was just a
29:19
preliminary thing where there were things in your heart you were thinking negatively about somebody but it wasn't
29:25
for a long time so fortunately it didn't lead to negative actions towards that person in most cases you wouldn't need
29:33
to go to the person and tell them all that was going on in your heart um you can just repent to God about
29:47
that but it also just depends I mean sometimes you can feel convicted sometimes the Bible says confess your
29:53
sins um publicly so I mean it's not like it's bad had ever to in most cases to
30:01
confess like man I've been sitting in this areas I just want to confess this I just maybe want accountability you know
30:09
so you shouldn't feel like it's like wrong to confess things it's just about
30:15
knowing what I'm sharing is like to not feel like you like something religious
30:20
or that you haven't really repented if you're not telling all these people or telling the specific person's a thought
30:27
that you had about them many times like but like if it's
30:34
your spiritual leader many times it's important to be like fully honest and
30:40
like you need you need freedom in this area so to confess that is to be fully
30:45
open and fully honest and say I don't want any of this in it's it's like part
30:51
of being open before God because God uses vessels and you are uh submitted
30:56
planted under your spiritual leader so so it's it's an area of surrender to God
31:01
to be honest and and say like I need help I need this power of God I need
31:07
freedom in this area um as God uses vessels as God uses your leader it's
31:12
good in those cases many times to be honest and to just confess and to not to
31:17
to to to Really make it a Firm Stance devil I don't want this anymore in my life a person received freedom but then
31:24
their life went turned into immediate refining fire this person lost their job
31:30
is now depressed because of that I believe and has back pain so um there's
31:37
a cost to becoming a disciple of Jesus there's a cost uh the cost is part of the cost is
31:44
refining fire because we don't become more like Jesus and transformed and a
31:50
usable vessel of him without the refining fire without going through hard things without God allowing the enemy to
31:57
attack back temporarily for us to defeat that battle and rise above it um and
32:04
come out stronger you know that's a cost you think about when you when you look at
32:10
the story of David and all he went through to be who God called him to be to be a follower of God disciple um he
32:19
went through such ridiculous things like the one he had blessed so much Saul
32:28
trying to kill him taking armies out to try to kill him just because of
32:34
jealousy God allowed that this was the cost this was part of the cost of being
32:39
a follower of God this was part of the cost of being whom God had called him to be as anointed king Joseph was thrown in
32:46
the pit by his brothers to die was then sold to slavery was then lied on by a
32:53
woman and then thrown in jail because the lie was believed and God allowed all of that why
32:59
because that was a cost David and Joseph they came out Victorious through it all
33:05
these attacks were temporary I mean these hard things they had to go through were temporary they were temporary it
33:11
was something they had to pass through it was a battle they had to fight and win fight the good fight of faith and
33:18
win and um there was reward that come that came
33:24
with that and there is Heavenly rewards that come with all of this so um the disciples they were persecuted
33:32
they were most of them were martyred before they were martyred they were persecuted so much
33:40
worse than we are persecuted today for the most part that the their
33:45
level of pers persecution the hard things they had to go through was so
33:51
much worse you know we deal with negative words lies towards us but they
33:58
dealt with being physically imprisoned being beaten um being told they literally
34:05
cannot speak the name of Jesus we have freedom of religion here and for the
34:11
most part Mo most people have freedom of religion in the world um so but that was the cost of
34:20
being a disciple and and I posted this today actually Jesus says count the cost
34:26
like it's powerful he says count the cost to becoming a disciple there's you got to pick up your cross and it's
34:32
powerful it's a powerful scripture because it's like saying like this is where true life is when you
34:39
give your life to Jesus true life true Abundant Life this is the only way only place that there is freedom Abundant
34:45
Life peace Joy contentment and salvation where you will go to heaven when you die
34:52
for eternity and you'll have relationship with God which is what brings you this contentment and peace
34:57
and joy um this relationship with God here and now like this is the most incredible
35:04
beautiful life and the only li like the only way of true life actually is surrender to Jesus but like you also
35:12
need to understand there's a cost to it it is so worth it anything with value has cost we are willing to um spend tons
35:20
of money on a an apartment to rent or a house to to buy um a car hard to drive
35:29
close to where we are totally willing and down with it like we're totally fine
35:36
with we're not like furious at the waiter for giving us a bill you know I
35:41
mean we're we we've counted the cost we count the cost we pay the cost we move
35:47
on we don't fret about it we don't get angry about it we don't get upset about it so um yeah I was really meditating on
35:56
this scripture lately how like we get the most amazing life
36:02
with Jesus but there is a cost but the cost is so little compared to what we
36:07
gain through Christ and it's so worth
36:13
it it's so worth it you know I mean it's it's like if you go this is probably a
36:20
silly example but like if you have a really good meal and it's like maybe it's like it's a meal that's
36:30
expensive but it tastes like so good like so much better than the cheap meals
36:36
that you usually have are you going to like complain to the waiter when he comes are you going to say like how dare
36:43
you charge me this much I've never charged this much for anything in my life like all the other restaurants
36:49
they're charging this amount like no you know it was worth it it had
36:56
value you counted the cost you chose to go to this restaurant that is more
37:02
expensive because for a reason because you wanted better tasting food and so you can peacefully pay the
37:09
bill and not be upset about it not be angry about it not cause a fuss right and so um it's kind of a silly example
37:17
but this is our life with Jesus like the life we gain we we don't many times we
37:23
take it for granted and we don't realize the alternative if we don't surrender to Jesus the alternative
37:28
is hell is torment is bondage is sickness it's it's awful and is an
37:36
eternity of hell and then surrendering our life to Jesus so we do have to go through persecution we do have to go
37:42
through those battles we do have to go through UND difficult times unfun times but it is so worth it the C the cost is
37:49
expensive but it's not that expensive compared to what we gain like it is
37:55
expensive it is it is expensive it it is a big
38:01
cost but it's it's small though like it's worth
38:07
it it doesn't even match what we gain you know and this is a perspective we
38:14
don't have as Believers a lot of the time and the enemy can deceive people so
38:20
easily when things get hard through Battles Through refining fire that God's
38:25
allowing the enemy can comes with this deceit like making you forget what he's done for you making you disvalue it
38:32
trying to get you to disvalue it and trying to feed you with lies
38:39
like where is God you know things like this um that's a scheme of the devil to
38:47
pull you away from being a true disciple so
38:52
uh it's really empowering to think about
38:58
how little the cost is compared to what we gain and how how it's even a smaller cost than the disciples the apostles
39:05
that went before us have paid doesn't change the fact that it hurts sometimes that it's not fun that
39:12
it's very uncomfortable sometimes that there may be tears sometimes doesn't change that fact but man it's worth it
39:20
and so there is a cost there is a cost the refining fire it's tempor orary it's
39:28
temporary it's not staying like this life is not staying like this you're in the middle
39:35
of the battle right now but Victory is coming you're in the middle of the battle right now but Victory is coming
39:43
this two Shall Pass Hallelujah can you please expand on how
39:49
refining fire increases before breakthrough
39:55
comes so
40:02
you become promoted in the spiritual realm you God lifts you after you have passed
40:14
tests job was lifted to receive double than what he had before
40:21
in terms of blessings after he was tested
40:28
so being you know because the Reason God lifts you which lifting looks like an increase
40:36
in influence for his glory to reach more other to reach others for his name so he
40:45
can use you to reach others and um lifting also comes with
40:51
blessings like that's a way of lifting is blessings and rewards like what hope
40:58
experienced you see Joseph Joseph and David when they were once lifted to that
41:03
place of being King and being second to the king
41:10
um it came with both that influence so that God could use them to reach more
41:16
people but it also came with blessings and rewards so that was lifting but when
41:25
both of their cases the lifting came came not it be they had they had
41:32
to they had to be going through they had to go through spiritual
41:37
tests to really rise up in the rank spiritually like when you when you go
41:46
through a battle a testing a battle that God uses as a test so battle is like the
41:53
Devil comes and attacks you many usually it's through people lots of times it's through people attacking you Devil comes
41:59
through somebody God allows it to attack to attack you now the devil's trying to
42:05
stop you but God the Bible says God never allows you to he doesn't allow Temptations to
42:12
come that you cannot that you cannot overcome so God is smart he knows this
42:19
kind of battle that's coming this kind of attack from the enemy he knows that because of your heart and because of how
42:26
he's molded you in the past coming to this point you'll be able to have victory over
42:32
this you will it's still up to us we still have the free will but God has given us what we
42:40
need so God then allows that attack then you have Victory and once you have
42:48
Victory what's happened is you've gone through something different you've gone through something you never gone through before you've gone through something
42:54
more difficult and and and you doing that and having victory means that you've choosen
43:00
Faith choosen obedience choosen humility chose chosen surrender and you've done these things in a a new way a higher way
43:09
a different kind of way because of this hard thing that came but you still chose Faith you still
43:15
chose humility you still chose obedience you still chose surrender you still chose to be obedient in all things
43:23
including staying focused on what God has called you to do do the work of God stay strong be fir stand firm in the
43:30
word of God believe the word of God confess the word of God uh not choosing to not doubt okay so you've done all of
43:37
these things in a new way you've done you've exhibited faith and surrender in
43:43
a new way and so with that it's like you've you've defeated a more difficult
43:50
battle and with that you become higher in the spiritual
43:56
realm you've become [Music] um stronger spiritually you've become
44:02
stronger in faith uh and and so you are more of a leader you're more of a leader that can
44:09
be entrusted with more influence that can be trusted with more blessing because you have to be ready
44:14
for the blessing so the blessing doesn't Crush you so that you receive the blessing to bless
44:20
others you know um you receive the blessing and don't take pride from it but become humbled even more
44:27
right so um then the lifting comes so David Joseph they went through those
44:37
attacks after choosing God they chose God already they love God already they
44:42
were serving God already they were going through things already David was going through fighting the Lions and the Bears
44:49
and then he went through fighting Goliath he was going through things so they were already on this Faith Journey
44:55
they were already passing tests they were already um climbing up you know growing stronger
45:03
spiritually and then came the biggest attack of them
45:09
all then came the biggest testing of them all now they were ready for this because the greatest lifting of all was
45:16
about to come so that there had to be the the biggest
45:22
battle the biggest testing that they were now prepared for so
45:27
um that's what's going on in the spiritual realm that's what's going on in the spiritual
45:34
realm that's why there's the the most [Music]
45:39
um Warfare refining fire before the biggest breakthrough it's all planned by
45:45
God you know you it's and it's part of shaping you it's part of transforming you I know the attack I had gone
45:53
through persecution I went through three years ago totally shaped me totally
45:58
transformed me totally totally transformed me totally took me higher
46:04
spiritually in terms of like made me have more faith and I've literally seen the evidence of it now because now going
46:11
through in these days ever since going through persecution I literally feel
46:16
different I literally feel different I literally can feel more faith in me I
46:23
literally can feel more strength I literally can feel feel more peace and joy than I did before going through
46:30
similar things hallelujah how did that happen that happened through the transformation that happened through
46:36
that refining fire of that previous battle so I became literally a different person I became stronger I became more
46:43
like Jesus glory to God that literally happened um Hallelujah and so that it's
46:51
like how God lifts how God transforms how our Faith grows how we
46:58
become more like Christ how God releases blessings when you realize this and this
47:04
is all throughout the Bible like it's very clear it's nothing like super profound what I'm saying it's really all
47:11
over the Bible but the thing is is like you have to see that the Bible is for us today you have to see that this is these
47:17
aren't just like stories that will make make a good movies um this this is for us today this
47:25
is an example for us today this is what we can expect for our lives
47:34
today this is a part of counting the cost and what has
47:41
strengthened me so much especially in recent recent times of battles recent
47:46
times of persecution the thing that strengthened me the most has been counting the
47:54
cost has been renewing my mind with that
48:00
scripture like I've chosen to be a disciple I have to pay the cost God has this great plan for my life
48:07
God has this big assignment for my life that requires a bigger
48:14
cost it's worth it though but but it's okay so that really helps me to not hear
48:22
the devil's lies and to see it for what it really is and to not be selfish why
48:30
do I have to pay this why is this happening to me this is unfair how can this be happening to me
48:37
this is so not fair it helps to not like take things personally and be um selfish
48:44
honestly because I signed up to pay the price when I said yes to Jesus to
48:51
becoming his disciple and also when I said yes to this calling when I said to
48:57
this calling I didn't sign up for an easy ride to the calling I signed up for a bigger cost
49:05
God's like Catherine I'm calling you to pay a greater cost as my disciple than
49:10
others will I'm calling to pay but this is this is the deal it's but it's worth
49:16
it and I'm going to be able to do great things through you and and bless many lives and bring many people to Kingdom
49:23
but this is the truth it's a bigger cost for you you than others like we need to
49:30
um know that word that Jesus speaks you know take it to heart take it to heart
49:37
this is part of being a disciple okay okay Lord okay Lord and so when it comes you
49:44
say okay this is paying the price time okay I signed up for this willingly so
49:51
therefore I will not complain I will keep my joy I will keep my peace and um
49:58
I won't throw a fit for paying the cost I won't be silly and and throw a
50:05
fit throw a fit at the waiter how foolish would somebody look at pay and sometimes you see that happen
50:12
right in real life you say you see people complaining over things like maybe the food wasn't cooked properly
50:17
how they wanted it or something and they throw a huge fit and they look foolish right like mistakes happened or maybe
50:24
there's miscommunication like we we um we need to grow up and um be
50:31
respectful towards God right and you know not complain for things um that are
50:40
actually intended for our good and that God has been clear to us about and that
50:45
we have agreed to and signed up for amen it should be exciting to pay
50:51
the price too because it's like when you pay the price when you swipe the card
50:57
for the clothing then you get the clothing
51:03
right um when you you know when you pay
51:08
the rent then you get to go in the house when you pay for the car then you get to drive the car away so you paying the
51:15
price is a sign of the blessings coming and God's will being done in your life
51:20
that it's coming you're getting very close Hallelujah and um
51:27
and also like every time that I've seen uh attack of the enemy like the most
51:33
severe kinds of attacks of the enemy persecution every time it has been
51:40
um in a time where the like the enemy was so angry
51:47
at what what God was doing through me it
51:53
was very clear it was very clear like it was like oh of course he's he's very angry
52:02
because of do got is open because of the testimonies and the Miracles taking
52:08
place because of growth because of growth in Min the ministry different
52:14
things it's it's been very obvious to see the timing of things the timing of
52:21
attacks and so to see it with a godly perspective is to see
52:28
Hallelujah the devil's mad There's real damage being caused to
52:34
the devil's Kingdom The Works of the devil are really being destroyed God's kingdom is advancing
52:42
rapidly so much so that the devil is losing his mind is I mean is losing it
52:48
trying to do whatever he can to try to stop it
52:54
Hallelujah that should be humbling encour encouraging exciting and
53:02
humbling that's you know we are that's why you know that's one of
53:07
the reasons why blessed are those who are persecuted for Jesus's
53:15
sake part of the reason you're blessed is because the persecution comes when
53:22
God is able to really use you when you are really being a vessel a
53:29
powerful vessel for God that is when persecution
53:35
comes so that's a great joy That's so exciting and it's also humbling it's
53:42
also humbling that wow it's a wakeup call like God is really able to move
53:49
through me and destroy the devil's Works glory to God
53:57
I Joy I take joy in the insults I take joy in the persecution then praise
54:03
God hallelujah when people around you at work do not
54:09
receive Jesus's move in his Revival do I just love them and be who God called me to be and not bring it up until they ask
54:17
yeah I mean I I share about this a lot um so I encourage you to watch other subscriber q&as cuz I address this a lot
54:25
just how to be the light in the world how to love with gentleness and kindness
54:31
and not be pushy or religious you know I shared this a lot so I encourage you to check out past subscriber Q&A they're on
54:36
my YouTube you can see them all just for more about this but I'll just share right now shortly um yeah I mean share
54:46
first of all your social media is such a powerful tool because this is like where you get to really share your
54:53
heart and it's your personal page so you don't need to feel like you need to please somebody through your social
54:59
media page you shouldn't you should be pleasing God through your social media page and this is a big place where you
55:06
can showcase your faith and you can really be loud and proud share share
55:13
share what God is doing and people will see and um people won't
55:20
get mad or offended if you're posting so much well I mean what I mean is they
55:27
will not feel like you are trying to shove Jesus down their throats because they understand that this is your
55:35
personal page your your social media page is kind of like your your house your room you can decorate it how you
55:40
want like the outside of your house you can paint it how you want people may judge you for it people may not like how
55:45
you painted your house but it's your house you know you don't need to you you
55:51
should be unashamed of how you express yourself with your house
55:56
and so in your social media page you should feel unashamed with how you express yourself and you should see it as an obligation from God responsibility
56:04
to shine your light there and just share what God is doing this is a place where you have influence where you have a
56:09
voice and if people don't want to hear it they can unfollow you they can defriend you if they want but this is
56:16
your place to speak the truth of Jesus and share what he's doing but then when
56:21
it comes to relationships um it's just in workplace it's just important to shine your light
56:27
with wisdom so the biggest way we shine our lights is by being loving by being Christlike and and showing the love of
56:34
God to them showing our joy showing our peace speaking with kind words not gossiping
56:40
Etc and that will be attracting and so those people that feel attracted to you
56:46
attracted to Friendship attracted to well I mean I don't mean just if they
56:51
feel attracted to you that you should like hang out with them all the time I talk a lot about boundaries a lot so check out my videos on that you can I
56:58
have a playlist called relationships where I talk about boundaries and all of
57:03
that I won't get into that right now but but what I mean is if someone feels drawn to talk to you more at work for
57:08
example um because you're shining your light now this is a time where you know they're opening up and they are Desiring
57:15
to hear more about your life more about what you're interested more about your passions more of what made you who you
57:20
are why you're so joyful and everything and so now you could be sharing your testimony sharing about um what God is
57:27
doing sharing about Jesus but um to start out with you can as people
57:34
are you know open to it you can share your testimony and share about what Jesus is
57:41
doing in his Revival now and if people are don't want to hear it you know then
57:49
be respectful and don't shove it down their throats but keep being the light keep shining keep shining on your social
57:55
media you know but yeah you shouldn't be pushy and forceful and keep bringing things up
58:01
if someone is very against very resistant but it should but don't let
58:07
that influence your personal life don't that let that influence your light don't let that don't like for example like if
58:14
you had a shirt about God's power or something you know don't be uh oh like
58:21
feel like bad about wearing it to work or something like that you know don't be afraid about what you post because of
58:29
some people that follow you they don't they're they don't want to hear about Jesus don't let it affect that but I'm
58:36
just talking about in terms of bringing things up and conversation everything you do not need to be like shoving it to
58:41
them you shouldn't be that was like forceful um and not gentle if they've been resistant at one point do we stop
58:48
talking to someone when defending the work of God just with wisdom um it's
58:55
different every situation really walk with wisdom with the Holy Spirit
59:02
um basic a big in indication of what that wisdom will look like is as you've
59:10
spoken what is you've defended as you feel you should have in the proper way
59:18
um to the extent that you should have and the person doesn't want to listen um
59:24
and it's turning into just back and forth is turning into a real
59:30
argument before it turns into that actually is when you should stop so um
59:38
it is important to defend the work of God um but we are not called to like keep
59:45
exerting so much energy to like one person to try to convince them when they
59:53
don't have ears to hear so usually it will not be a long time of going back
1:00:01
and forth in most cases thank you Jesus
1:00:06
Hallelujah well I declare for every single one of you today who has brought prayer requests here who has sickness or

1:01:35
condemning lie of the devil religious lie of the devil that's aimed at its

1:02:53
God to me to to you to the Revival Army God is going to use this for good
1:03:02
God is intending it for good this is going to be the devil's biggest big big big time regret and mistake in Jesus
1:03:09
name there's a lifting God is bringing through this as what I shared today
1:03:14
actually answering a question there is a lifting coming so that way more people
1:03:20
can come into His Revival and encounter his power encounter his love receive
1:03:26
freedom and healing and salvation this is what God has planned and the devil is
1:03:31
being used as a catalyst of this just like he was in the times of David just
1:03:36
like he was in the times of Joseph just like he was in the times of Jesus when they put him on a cross that was the
1:03:43
Catalyst for us to be saved and for Jesus to be resurrected praise God and so this is
1:03:52
what is happening so I I I I I I pray for your eyes to be opened up more as
1:03:57
Elijah Elisha prayed for his servant for the his eyes to open up to see the army that was with them was so much greater
1:04:04
than the Army coming against them may your eyes open up more so that you can
1:04:09
be stronger spiritually and be as I described as I shared earlier even as I
1:04:15
shared about counting the cost as I shared about the the real godly perspective that through persecution
1:04:22
through attacks from the enemy we really should have joy we really should have peace peace we really should have this
1:04:28
um awareness of like yes of course this is happening this is what I signed up for this is the cost but this is a good
1:04:34
thing this is what's coming then this is what's coming then is the calling for my
1:04:39
life for our life for Revival expanding this is what's coming this is nothing
1:04:44
but a good thing let this Revelation enter your heart more for your own
1:04:50
personal life and for the for the Revival Army for the work of God let
1:04:57
this Revelation increase in your heart so that you can truly be a part of what
1:05:05
the enemy intended for evil God intended for good so that you can actually be
1:05:10
walking in more joy more peace more anointing be lifted spiritually be used
1:05:17
more powerfully for God in Jesus name
