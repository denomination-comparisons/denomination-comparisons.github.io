Intro
0:00
how do you know when to declare or command and when to request for example for pain to leave and or healing to come
0:07
over myself two Sundays ago I actually taught on that in depth the G praying
0:13
the Jesus way praying in the new wine way so watch that for an indepth
0:20
teaching and explanation on that but I'll just give you a quick summary right
0:26
now to answer your question the main way that God releases Miracles is through anointed vessels that's what we see in
0:32
the Bible through Peter through Paul that people would come under Peter's Shadow for example and when they
How to seek healing and freedom
0:39
did the power of God would move through Peter and that power of God would touch them heal them deliver them we see
0:47
five-fold ministers throughout the Book of Acts um praying for the sick and they
0:52
were healed casting out demons raising the Dead uh and so that's really our
0:59
direction of how to seek healing and freedom is to seek God's kingdom to seek
1:04
where God has established his servants where he's placed his anointing his high
1:10
level anointing and Authority because the high level anointing is needed in many cases to deal with these demonic uh
1:19
cases you know that are um stronger demonic Powers so God calls you to be
1:28
planted in a church where God's power is is where his kingdom is where he has
1:33
anointed his servant to be a leader and release this anointing so when you are
1:39
planted at a church where God's power is for example if you are planted at fivefold church it's like you are coming
1:46
under Peter Shadow every week multiple times like the subscriber Q&A today and
1:52
the usual weekly lives and um also uh flourishes events throughout the week
1:59
any any time you come in person or come online it's literally like you are
2:05
positioning yourself under Peter's shadow of today and the anointing will
2:12
overshadow you will touch you will come upon you and will bring healing and deliverance so it's so important for you
2:18
to understand God's ways of how he releases his power of how he brings about the Miracles sure he can move
2:24
outside of that principle and you know just release a healing without a vessel
2:31
but that's kind of the exception like that's it's it's like his main way of
2:38
releasing his power and doing Miracles is this way through a vessel in his kingdom government and so
2:46
he wants us to seek his kingdom he wants us to do things his way to adhere to his principles rather than be like well God
2:53
you can do anything and so for me make me the exception like do something
2:58
different now for me no he wants us to be humble and obedient to his ways um
3:05
because only he decides when he moves outside of his main way you know uh so
3:13
it'll be more of like a surprise type thing if if he does it outside of his main way not something that we're
3:18
supposed to like demand you know um so that being said we're supposed to have
3:24
this understanding like how God's releasing the power how he's releasing the Miracles and and it's it should be
3:31
this like simple childlike faith we have like I'm coming under the shadow of apostle Peter of today like I'm coming
3:36
under the shadow of where God's power is truly being released and therefore I
3:41
must be healed I must be free simple and just knowing this is God's will for you
3:47
by his stripes you are healed healing and freedom from demonic oppression is already has already been given to you
3:53
now it's just about accessing accessing it so it's not like you're having to convince God and requests and requests
3:58
and requests from him to heal you he wants you to have this Faith this is your portion this is what he wants for
4:04
your life now you just need to do what he says to do to receive it believe and
4:09
position yourself where the go where God's power is moving so the proper way to pray is to for these Miracles is to
4:18
um well thank god like thank you Lord that you've given me this gift of healing and freedom it is mine is my
4:25
inheritance I thank you Jesus that you paid the price for this that you endured those stripes you endur those whippings
4:30
those lashes that led to me being healed by his stripes we were healed I thank you Jesus and I receive the healing and
4:37
freedom you gave me God loves those prayers because it's it's Faith it's um showing that you really believe in his
4:44
word you really believe in the power of what he has done you know you're not taking it lightly what he has done you
4:51
believe that he endured that scoring and the purpose of endur enduring the scoring and the you believe he went on
4:58
the cross and sacrificed himself for us and shed blood for us and you value it
5:03
so you thank him and then you say I believe I believe I will receive I will
5:09
receive what's already been given to me by you God as the anointing as the power
5:14
of God touches me pray that way as you before and as you are coming to church
5:21
or coming to the live stream and that is Faith you know that's the faith of the
5:26
woman with issue of blood where she reached out to touch Jesus's robe you know she's like I believe that when I
5:33
touch his the Hem of His robe the anointing will touch me so it's like that and that's what released the
5:39
healing he says because of your faith you were healed so you know for you to to be in the same way I'm going to touch
5:45
the robe and the meaning of that is I'm going under the shadow I'm going positioning myself where God's power is
5:50
being released through this vessel you know through my leader if it's the church you're planted at it's a prayer
5:57
of with faith that releases am mirales and that's pleasing to God and so then you come and it's now just about
6:04
receiving just letting the anointing touch you if you're not seeing it manifest right away you he wants you to believe
6:12
you already have received and it's going to manifest fully and sometimes he like
6:17
releases the anointing and to do some one thing in you but not to do other
6:22
things but he releases the anointing like later that week or the next Sunday
6:27
to do more things you know it's a process so it's this balance of um you
6:33
know thanking God that he for sure healed you even though you haven't seen the manifestation yet but also if
Receiving more anointing
6:38
there's a lot of Deliverance you need uh if there's a lot of healing you need also have that awareness of it's
6:43
important I seek and I'm going to receive more in the area of healing and freedom today you know not just one and
6:49
done like I went one time and God healed me of everything and I just have to see it manifest now for some you may you
6:57
know you may have tons of layers and so wants you to have this expectancy of I'm receiving more anointing today to
7:03
receive more healing that I need and you might not know all that God has done
7:09
that's okay like you don't need to know oh what what has already taken place but I will see it manifest later and what
7:17
still like God's going to put more of his anointing on to heal you know you don't need to like figure it all out but
7:24
God wants you to have that childlike faith knowing if you if you needed you know a lot of healing Deliverance of a lot of
7:30
things he wants you to have that faith knowing I to I have received God has done a miracle in my life or many
7:36
miracles he's done healing he's healed me freed me and I will see it but also I need to keep positioning myself to
7:42
receive more so God can continue doing this work in me amen hallelujah and then once you
7:50
find that you're totally free totally healed it's totally manifested he still wants you to be in that position that
7:57
heart position of um heart posture of I need more of your anointing I need more of your anointing to touch me today
8:05
to do miracles in my life like in terms of CH transforming my heart and things
8:11
that I don't even know I need right like maybe you have things from your past and
8:17
maybe you have old wine and just things that you went through with abuse in the past or something that you didn't know
8:25
was um like blocking you spiritually from having understanding in the
8:31
spiritual realm or maybe it's like blocking you from having full peace and
8:37
joy and contentment like maybe there's things you you know healing and deliverance you need but you didn't know
8:43
you needed because you never tasted total freedom before right and so you
8:48
know but you're coming expectant Lord I know I need you I know I need more of your power so I come expectant for you
8:56
to do a work in me so sometimes you'll know exactly what it it is you need God to do for you sometimes you won't but
9:02
you come with that childlike heart I have felt boldness to share what we've learned this year but I keep worrying
Sharing what youve learned
9:08
that I will teach too much and go out of order or misrepresent 5f is this the
9:13
enemy or fear of God so you know you know what you're sharing is very
9:19
important to do it's very good to do it's spreading the good news uh but you just need to walk in wisdom so it's
9:26
really just this balance walking in wisdom balance like for
9:31
example when you have people in your life friends family
9:37
co-workers that are o o Open opening up like where they
9:43
want to uh learn how you've changed like
9:48
maybe you're talking and just sharing how you've experienced so much more intimacy with God and transformation in
9:55
spiritually in your life and you've grown strong stronger
10:00
you've grown stronger in your faith more than ever before maybe this kind of conversation you're having with somebody
10:06
maybe they haven't been to 5f yet or something for example like if you're planted at 5f
10:12
church for example uh so yeah maybe they're like You know open to learn
10:19
maybe they asked a question for example like why are you how did you grow closer to God and maybe your answer a big one
10:25
of your answers is how you were freed of old wine and your eyes open up about how
10:31
to pray spiritually and not religiously you can totally share that
10:36
like share what you've learned you know share that knowledge that you've
10:41
received but it's important you share like where you've received that from and
10:47
really encourage the person watch this teaching like what I'm sharing with you has come from a teaching so you can
10:55
learn and understand a lot more in this teaching and there's many many teachings I
11:02
encourage you to go on the YouTube and and what there's like the Revival army
11:08
training playlist you know the how to have a relationship with God playlist and then also Rel I think there's a
11:15
relationships podcast as well like that has a lot of
11:20
boundaries you know soul ties things like this teaching on those so that's the way of wisdom to
11:27
share what you've learned how you could be going out of order maybe is to
11:36
like really teach publicly when God hasn't sent you to do
11:42
that like to maybe go live and teach in a in a way of like a public Ministry
11:50
type thing so by doing that without um
11:56
being sent by God or if you are planning somewhere that you you know you do that
12:02
without asking your spiritual leader like is this okay or what's the right order or I'm feeling this on my heart
12:10
what's the what is your direction advice about what I'm feeling about this urge
12:15
to teach and everything like that so you know not doing that that would be going
12:21
out of order but to just be like sharing from your heart what you've learned
12:26
that's that's going to be a great way of planting seeds of shining your light
12:32
because um you know people will be really curious that I mean it's a great way to be planting seeds you know
Planting seeds
12:38
conversations like even this year like how did your how is your year in 2024 as
12:43
we're looking into the next year right how are you were reflecting on this past year and maybe you'll share with someone
12:49
it was the best year of my life why because of all this you know or I grew closer to God like never before how well
12:57
a lot of it was teachings that I learned like my eyes opened up and you can share a little bit um that's great that's
13:05
amazing that's a an amazing way to plant seeds and to shine your light it's a
13:11
great way to shine your light because some people they're they're seeing your light shine so bright and they're or
13:18
they're like longing to have a relationship with God a good relationship with God
13:23
intimacy with God and then you're sharing this and you're sharing how and their eyes are like open opening up like
13:30
wow you know just as you're sharing a little bit of teaching and that's going to be drawing them to Jesus that's
Can you clarify order
13:37
they're attracted to your light amen can you clarify order if someone in five
13:43
have asked for prayer yeah so as I shared it's so important that we encourage people to be spiritually
13:51
mature and in the new wine rather than cowering to religion or cowering to
13:57
what's pleasing to man and you know and so there's going to be some people that
14:03
maybe it's you know there there's so much wanting things the old way there's so much
14:10
wanting one-on-one prayer or something you know but like God is releasing his
14:17
his anointing as the servant of God executes the authority and so it's not
14:22
one-on-one prayer that brings about a miracle it's when a true servant of God is Anointed and they execute their
14:27
Authority and then that anointing moves upon everyone who is
14:34
there receiving and so that's what happened in the times of Peter for
14:40
example we don't see any example of people needing to have one-on-one prayer
14:46
you know like we don't see any example in the Bible of there needing to be a really like like Jesus Jesus was
14:52
ministering to thousands we don't see him assigning his disciples to be like
14:59
like praying oneon-one as he was praying for the masses because that wasn't needed it's
15:05
not God's way it's God God's way is that he anoints a servant of God and the servant of God executes their Authority
15:12
and that powerful anointing goes to everybody so it doesn't actually make sense to like send another person to do
15:19
a one-on-one prayer with somebody when the anointing is already been released upon them and the Miracle has already
15:25
taken place and I know the the latter way I mean the way that I just just that way
15:32
is is like what's most common but God is bringing the new wine restoring the new wine right
15:39
now so um we don't see Jesus having to spend like 10
15:45
hours you know going through like a line of people to get one-on-one prayer you
15:51
know of thousands of people no because he God is so big we don't need
15:58
to do one-on-one prayer for each person it the anointing touches everybody with
16:04
the word Jesus declared the word to the Centurion Soldier servant without being in the presence of the servant without
16:10
physically without doing a one-on-one prayer without even touching and that Faith as Satan Soldier had that he Jesus
16:18
only needed to speak a word really pleased Jesus he was really so in awe of his faith and was so happy he was so
16:25
happy with that Faith because he was able to do what God's called him to do he was
16:31
able to release that Miracle quickly efficiently
How to receive the anointing
16:36
easily because that Faith was there he didn't have to go travel just to get
16:42
there to do a one-on-one prayer you know so anyways you have in church today of
16:47
course people sometimes being resistant to receiving the new wine or maybe it just like makes them feel better like I got
16:55
the one-on-one prayer so maybe now I'll be healed you know but we have to stand strong and be
17:02
obedient to receive and value this new wine God's
17:07
ways so I just shared previously like the for the first question in this this
17:12
live I just shared how to actually pray how to receive your Miracle so you apply
17:18
that to when someone asks like if they if they are at five of church if they're
17:24
planted at five of church for example and they you know say they need prayer from you or something you know you can
17:31
remind them the power of God was released upon you this Sunday this
17:38
Wednesday this whatever that anointing touched you and miracles have taken
17:44
place so let that Miracle manifest in
17:50
your life I know the power of this anointing the power of our God and I
17:57
know that the word will not return void you know the great thing you can do is
18:02
to encourage them in to encourage them to have faith that's the great way you
18:09
can help them because we need to have faith to receive what God has for us we
18:15
can't do it any other way we can't like manipulate God we can't do it another
18:20
way so you really need to have a heart to help other people you know not to do
18:25
something that's going to temporarily please them God has called you to execute your
18:31
authority to pray over the sick to cast out demons in your own domain in your own spiritual territory so it's kind of
18:39
like when people came under Peter's Shadow all those that came under his shadow that was Peter's spirit that was
18:44
his domain and it says all were healed so when people came under his domain
18:51
those words couldn't return void those Miracles had to take place there wasn't
18:56
something else that had to be done and so when you come to the church that
19:02
you're planted at you are there to receive anointing you're there to
19:08
receive the anointing to heal you and deliver you you're you're there to receive equipping to be a mature
19:15
Victorious servant of God and you're there to receive impartation of anointing to be able to cast out demons
19:23
and heal the sick in your own spiritual territory your own domain domain and so
19:30
your own spiritual territory and domain is going to look like the workplace for example or People You Meet who God leads
19:38
you to plant seeds in and they open up to you and then he may lead you then
19:43
to pray healing over them or command demons to leave them for the average
19:51
believer the normal believer that's not a five full Minister it's not going to look like for the most part casting
19:57
demons out all day every day it's going to I mean the big area of that taking
20:04
place is going to be in the church but we are all the all these signs shall follow all who believe they shall cast
20:10
out demons they shall heal the sick so it's important for you to understand that because some people can try to
20:16
think they think that like they're supposed to be looking exactly like five full ministers but we have different
20:22
callings and so the believer's job is to to evangelize to be the light to attract
20:29
people into the kingdom and to come into the kingdom is to come into the church
20:35
to come into the body of Christ um where people are equipped and healed and
20:40
delivered the main place is the church so the believer's job is so much the
20:46
majority of it is to be the light to attract the Lost in the world plant
20:52
seeds and invite them bring them to where the powerful anointing can touch
20:58
their lives so you have anointing and you are releasing that anointing upon the people but we're supposed to you're
21:04
supposed to be humble to know your calling like when you're not a fful minister to know that this person they
21:12
need more than what you can give them you know they need that equipping
21:17
of from the fful ministry in the church and so it's important you're
21:24
humble in that area too when it comes to fellow believers who are planted where you're at you know it's important you don't like
21:32
try to be just like um Your Leader like take their you know take their place
21:38
like what their position or something like that but understand like humbly understand your role in the body so so
21:47
much of your role is actually going to be to encourage other believers encourage other believers rather than
21:56
um harm them by bringing religion you know or harm them by pleasing man
22:03
pleasing man or woman instead of God because that is harmful you know that's
22:09
confusion um to do things out of order to do things in the old wine way
22:14
religious way that's like actually going against what is being released and
22:20
taught at the church your planed at so you should have the fear of God in this you know you should have the fear of God
22:27
that you only want to help build never scatter or bring confusion
22:33
but you only want to help build build the Believers and build the work build
22:38
the house of God how can I be more patient in the wilderness season um I'm
The refining fire
22:44
going to have a video about that actually coming out this week or next week um but I also encourage you I have
22:54
a playlist on YouTube called um secret of the anointing playlist and there's
23:01
one message I don't remember what it's called but I don't remember the name of it but it's either
23:07
called the refining Fire or the Wilderness I forget the name of it right
23:15
now but um or the cost I think I was wearing I think I'm
23:21
like wearing a pink dress and my hair is in a bun I think I'm like I'm like remembering visually like what it what
23:29
you know I was wearing that day of what I was preaching that but that's going to be a message that will help you as well
23:35
um also I just refining fire okay cool also
23:41
um I my Walking In Miracles ecourse there is a teaching on that as well and um a
23:50
secret of the anointing book there's like a couple chapters on that I'm just
23:57
sharing this because um I want you to really be equipped as possible and I have this is one of my big messages that
24:03
I've shared on in different ways but also
24:10
um a couple days ago I posted a little five minute video that you should watch
24:16
as well or and rewatch I was like watching it and was even encouraged myself like it was just a special holy
24:23
moment on the mountain with God and I just I loved I love to like rewatch it myself because it just took me back to
24:30
that Holy moment but I've been thinking a lot about patience in the wilderness lately especially because there's been
24:37
promises I'm I wouldn't say I'm in the wilderness most people would see that I'm in the promised land but I see it
24:43
more as um I remember the Israelites uh when they finally entered the promised
24:50
land you know even though they entered the
24:55
promised land there was still so much work to be done to really claim and enjoy the promised land and enter it
25:04
fully like if you read in the word like right after they enter the promised land
25:10
the walls of Jericho to come down they have so many battles they have to fight
25:15
there's all of these armies that don't want them to like they're already
25:20
occupying the territory right and they don't want to just easily leave and give up the land that rightfully belongs to
25:28
the Israelites by God God gave them this land you know they have to fight these
25:34
battles and they win battle after battle after battle for the first time that I when I read that those whole stories in
25:40
the scripture when I was actually you know enter the promis land you know of
25:46
like Revival like it really touched me like I really really related to it you know
25:52
like how you expect like you enter the promised land and then everything's there at one time in the promised land
25:59
like and it's like you're on the beach you know and it's butterflies and
26:07
rainbows right but it's ey opening when you read the scripture to see that they
26:12
were finally there but there was still so much work to be done there's still so much of a fight in
26:20
the spiritual realm fighting the good fight of Faith to be done to really claim and enjoy and see more of the
26:28
promised land so there's all these different territories of the promised land there's you know they go to one
26:33
different territory and they fight this one battle and then they're then able to claim that territory so there's so many different aspects of the ter you know
26:39
promised land that they're not able to like claim or enjoy yet because there's
26:45
a fight first and so I really related to that and um so yeah so so so even though
26:52
I'm in the promised land um there's so much more as I always say in this revival we it's just the beginning it's
26:59
just a very small percentage and so there's big prophecies over my life and in this revival that my spiritual father
27:07
prophesied like pretty much from the beginning that first year 2016 um some of them I have not seen yet
27:15
but they are coming to pass in God's perfect timing and then there was many new prophecies that he prophesied right
27:23
after the Revival broke out in 2021 and I heard these
27:29
prophecies I had the expectant heart
27:34
that they were going to happen immediately and
27:40
um you grow in wisdom as you walk with God and as you walk with
27:47
um or you you you you learn H re about receiving prophetic words I've learned
27:53
that it's so important we because the prophetic words are usually not given the exact time is when the
28:00
prophecy will come to pass and God of course doesn't want the prophet to say like this will happen but
28:09
it will be a very long time for now like God doesn't usually want the prophet to
Receiving prophetic words
28:15
add that because a big part of the process of
28:21
becoming the process of becoming the person you need to be to
28:26
receive the promise is the Journey of Faith which is not
28:33
seen not seen but believing so God really I've learned this like I've
28:40
learned that God like wanted me to believe these promises would come any
28:50
second and he knew they were actually going to come way later but he he wants that because he
28:57
wants my faith to grow because that's going to stretch the
29:03
faith you know like not really knowing when it's going to happen but believing it's going to happen soon but soon is
29:10
different with God than it is with us you know a day for God is the Thousand Years
29:15
so and a thousand years a day but like he wants you to have that
29:21
expectancy but no clue when it's going to happen but so much expectancy because
29:27
that breeds Faith Like That breeds because it doesn't happen right on I have some
29:34
expectancy I think it may happen today I really think it's GNA happen today and it doesn't happen today or it doesn't
29:40
happen this year and but God wants you to not let that get you down not let
29:48
that make doubt come in you he wants that to that disappointment
29:54
to not lead you to complain and be babyish and babyish
30:01
towards God and babyish in general so that's what I've really learned I've really learned that about God how like
30:09
he knows how to refine Us in the area of faith in the area of patience he knows
30:14
how to do that in a big way is you know delivering This Promise delivering this Prophecy with Zeal instilling expectancy
30:23
in us and wanting that expectancy to be in us like the wom the virgins who kept
30:30
their lamps burning they made sure they had oil for when the bridegroom came and he delayed but they made a priority to
30:38
make sure they're ready they're prepared even though he was delaying we still got to be prepared we still got to be ready
30:44
he's for sure coming we don't know when could be any second we got to be prepared God really wants us to have
30:50
that in our hearts he wants us to live in faith every day so if we that means
30:55
there's there's there's unknown things unknown timing of things right that have
31:00
to be there for us to really be walking by faith living in
31:06
faith yeah so I've learned that about God and so you know I've been thinking a
31:13
lot and God's been speaking to me a lot about the Wilderness recently and and
31:18
being patient and um the big thing is you need to you need to just remember who God is
31:26
and and never forget who God is like renew your mind with his faithfulness renew his mind with his goodness renew
31:33
his mind renew your mind renew renew renew renew renew because on the Mountaintop Seasons all these things are
31:40
happening blessings are happening and you're like wow God is faithful wow God is
31:46
good wow God is so amazing you feel it so strongly but then
31:53
in a different season when you're in the valley when you're in the waiting his goodness and faithfulness this hasn't changed at
31:59
all but many people tend to forget many people tend to
32:06
forget and it's it's um disrespectful to
32:11
God honestly because we have the word we know we got to go through the process we got to go
32:17
through the Wilderness like God's not trying to trick us like it's right it's right there for us to
Going through the wilderness
32:25
see he you know he's shown us like you the promised land doesn't come immediately you have to go through a
32:31
process you have to go through waiting you have to go through the finding fire like God has spoken this to us very
32:37
clearly but when the Wilderness comes we're it's like we it's easy to forget what God has
32:46
revealed to us and who God is so that's a big thing
32:51
because you know the devil can start speaking condemnation like oh maybe it
32:57
hasn't come to pass pass yet the promise because you're not doing enough oh you're feeling like really longing for
33:03
the promise oh you're not grateful enough like the devil can come in all these ways but the way you can have
33:08
Victory is if you can renew your mind to who God is his character his heart you know that
33:15
he's the truth is is that he's allowing this to happen for your good he's not punishing you with this this is for your
33:24
good he wasn't punishing job he did this CU he loved him he allowed these things to be the devil to
33:31
take these things away from him the thing those so many things blessings because he loved him he wanted to bless
33:37
him with even more and he wanted to lift him he wanted to give him honor anybody
33:43
who's written the Bible like as a person of Faith Like job they have more honor than anybody in the world right aren't
33:50
they the most honorable people in the world they're the most famous for good
33:55
like God lifted them for good like it's not bad thing to be famous like to be known for something good to inspire
34:02
people to inspire many many many many many many many many people you have to be known to be able to inspire many many
34:08
many people so like anyways job is just lifted at such
34:13
this such of this high place of honor but you don't get to be lifted at this high place of Honor by being
34:19
Ordinary by being average by being an average Believer by not going through
34:24
anything hard no you know these people in the Bible they're Heroes of Faith to be a
34:31
hero a leader an example you got to be different above the norm which means you
34:38
got to be willing to endure difficult things a big difficult thing that we got
34:43
to endure is the waiting the Wilderness yeah
34:49
so that was a hard season for a Joe but it was temporary and the way God lifted him and
34:56
honored him and blessed him that far surpasses what he went through I bet job would say I would he would do
35:03
it all over again you know it was just a short season compared to the rest of his life and for all eternity for thousands
35:11
of years and for all eternity he is lifted he is an example
35:18
he's a leader for billions upon billions upon billions of
35:24
people right so you know going through hard things and God is doing it for your
35:32
good and he's doing it for the world's good for to help other people he's
35:38
allowing you to go through something hard so that you can come out on the other side and say it's possible with
35:44
God you can be strong and it was temporary only and it was worth it
35:52
seeing the promise fulfilled touching God's heart being able to be a powerful
35:58
vessel for him of him it was all worth
36:04
it so you know that's the godly perspective and that is a that's a
36:09
perspective that's going to help you get through the Wilderness the biggest thing is we just
The wrong perspective
36:14
have the wrong perspective many times we are just we are focused on the negative
36:20
we are focused on what we don't have we are focused on the fact that the promise hasn't come to pass yet we are focused
36:27
on what we've done man we've waited so long we've done so many great things but God
36:32
hasn't given us this yet we're focused on what am I missing what am I doing
36:37
wrong and all of that's a waste of time all of that's a distraction all of that's what the enemy wants all of that
36:44
is a ploy like you focusing on that is a ploy of the enemy to take you off
36:51
track so um you know it's very important you know to take the spiritual knowledge
36:56
that I'm giving you and meditate on it a lot you know really
37:01
get it in you because then you can catch yourself you can catch the enemy you can catch the enemy you can catch yourself
37:07
you can catch your own thoughts you can catch the devil in your thoughts you can catch yourself just being emotional you
37:13
can just catch yourself and say hold
37:18
on I know better I know better I am I'm not going to look to the
37:27
negative anymore that's not the mind of Christ that's not God's perspective that's not
37:32
the right perspective and this is going to lead only to destruction it's going to lead to more impatience it's going to lead to it's going to lead me farther
37:39
from God because I'm going to start getting bitter towards God I'm going to lose my trust in God some I'm going to
37:44
start doubting and also I'm going to start being prideful entitled because you because you're so focused on I've
37:50
done all these things like how come it's not happening yet I'm seeing other people be blessed and I'm seeing other
37:56
people that you know I feel like I've been doing even more like good things for God than them but like they're being
38:03
blessed with these things and I just don't understand and then if you but you're if you're just focused on those
38:09
things it's going to lead to Pride it's going to lead to entitlement it's going to lead to a skewed perspective of God
38:15
seeing God is like not giving you what you deserve and stuff you see how how dangerous that is
38:25
how you being there can be this trap can easily lead you to discontentment
38:31
doubting God not Desiring to spend time with him wanting to fill voids now
38:38
because there's a void since you're putting your eyes away from God you've lost the
Dont fall for the trap
38:43
peace right so um that's like the biggest thing I can share with you is like don't fall
38:49
for the devil's trap you know remember God's perspective and remember how easy
38:55
it is to fall for that trap when you're emotional like when when the enemy sends
39:01
a spiritual attack in your moment of weakness your moment of vulnerability like how the devil came towards Jesus
39:07
Jesus was you know Jesus was so hungry he was 100% human 100% God so he was
39:14
fasting he hadn't eaten for 40 days and now the devil is saying turn this Stone to bread and so on a normal
39:20
day that would not be tempting at all but on that day it was tempting Jesus
39:27
overcame but it was tempting you know and so like you got to understand that when
39:34
you're in the waiting season when you're in the wilderness when you're in the refining fire You're vulnerable you know
39:40
it's an area of weakness and so the enemy wants to hop on that he wants to
39:47
um he wants to like fill you with the wrong perspective honestly he wants to fill you with the wrong
39:52
perspective so just like knowing that right there is really going to help you if you value if you can take this to
39:58
Heart it'll help you like snap out of it it'll help you you know cuz emotions can
40:04
feel so like truth sometimes right like if your thoughts are so in one way it can
40:13
it can feel like truth like reality but it's not God's word is the
40:18
truth and sometimes our feelings are not aligned with that and many times the devil strategically influences our
40:26
feelings comes in our thoughts thoughts so um yeah I mean I just feel so much
40:32
joy sharing this with you now because I I know that this is like serious meat and serious equipping
40:40
that you know I've gone through this what I'm sharing with you right now I've gone through it I've gone through it over several years I've gone through it
40:47
several years in I've faced this kind of thing and it's like I feel like what I'm
40:53
sharing with you I've gone through it so you don't have to if you can really value what I'm sharing with
40:58
you amen amen hallelujah Audrey says thank you for the
41:04
encouraging video post to remember where we used to be that was beautiful yeah you know that's just yeah if you haven't
Prophecies
41:11
seen that I posted it two days ago it's um you it's like a sunset behind me I'm on a
41:16
mountain and um that's just to add on like what I shared in that video that's
41:22
what's that's to that's like an add-on of what I just shared right now you know um that's that video was sharing so much
41:28
of like the perspective thing that I'm talking about like returning there was such a good perspective shift for me
41:35
honestly you know because I have so many promises that haven't come to pass yet that I thought would H would come to
41:40
pass um in 2021 there's so many there's so many and I mean there's like probably
41:47
there's several like different prophecies that I haven't like shared publicly because I the Lord's not
41:53
leading me to this is for me to keep to myself but there's like several prophecies that I believed would I didn't know the
42:01
exact time or day but like in your heart you feel I think it will happen like 2021 or maybe 2022 you know and um
42:09
there's a there's a lot like a lot of different ones like more than a handful not just one none of them pretty
42:16
much well no well kind of well well definitely like the the arena I will say
42:21
the arena the in Philippines for sure that one but um what I'm trying to say
42:26
is most of them I thought would happen in 2021 2022 and it wasn't God's timing
42:33
yet so like you know several even even when you're in the promised land when there are other Pro prophecies that
42:40
you're hungry for for to wait for years you know it's not always easy so my life isn't always you know um perfect every
42:47
day it's not always you know it's not always like
42:52
it's it's it's mostly easy to be content but it's not like every single day is easy to be a 100% content in the
43:00
emotions and sometimes the enemy will send attacks you know in the minds to all of us he does so to go to that that
Being content
43:08
Mountaintop it was such a a blessed holy moment time of God to help me have even
43:14
more the mind of Christ um his mind his perspective you know it's like we really
43:21
have to be intentional to remember the blessings God's given us you know because God has has can give you like so
43:28
many blessings and change your life years ago but then years passed and maybe you know not much has changed in
43:36
terms of other dreams coming to pass but like
43:42
it's it can be easy to forget how much God has blessed you with when it's been years you know or like maybe you wanted
43:50
to have a baby or something for so long and now the baby's like five or
43:55
something and so maybe it's not going through your mind so much like I used to
44:01
long for this child for years and now I have this child like
44:09
that is not going to naturally come through the head like that the mind you know years later but man we we got to
44:19
Value these blessings even when years pass by you know that takes intention
44:25
it's not going to happen automatically and I'm reminded of that story of the Israelites when they passed through the
The Israelites
44:31
waters when they passed through the waters and when God opened the waters
44:36
they put stones down in remembrance of what God did
44:44
there in remembrance of how he did that miracle for them and opened the seeg so
44:50
that they could get to the promised land and so why do they put stones there well
44:56
really the spiritual meaning is you know what God has done this mass
45:02
of blessing it is so big lest we never
45:07
forget it may we never forget this may we never disvalue this this is so big
45:14
what God has done it's like we have to take intention we have
45:20
to put these Stones down and we have to make a priority to go back to these
45:26
stones and Visually look at them and see and remember you know and so for me
45:34
to go to the mountain where I used to those of you that didn't watch this the video watch it after because you might
45:40
not know what I'm talking about now but um I used to go hiking on this on this
45:45
Mountaintop in Burbank California I used to live North Hollywood for from 2013 to
45:54
2021 and um so there was this hiking spot 10 minutes from where I lived and I would hike
46:01
there every after every church service for a while during Co times and um I
46:08
just have these memories of walking there and just believing in God and like it's been years I'm waiting for the
Hiking with God
46:14
promise but I trust you God like these prayer walks you know I remember doing that on the mountain it's really
46:19
peaceful there's like hardly anyone there and um and I actually made a video
46:25
one time when I was full of so much joy because 20 20 people showed up at the Park and
46:33
God moved in power through prophetic Ministry this is when I only saw a couple people be healed ever end in the ministry and I never saw a demon cast
46:40
out before it was only prophetic anointing moving which was big and powerful and amazing but I'm just trying
46:45
to share with you like where it was in that season it wasn't like it is now and so the the prophetic Ministry was
46:51
touching people so powerfully they were crying and that following day I was so
46:57
full of joy I was so grateful I just remember it so vividly
47:02
and I was so full of joy and feeling so close to God that I had to share a video
47:09
about how to have intimacy with God because I remembered that that day I felt so close to God and I was so full
47:14
of joy and I remember that I used to struggle having relationship with God and so that day I remember like I need
47:20
to record this video and teach people you know how they can feel close to God and be close to God and have real
47:26
intimacy with God and and so I recorded that video and it went viral I didn't expect it I'm like I'm like just in my
47:33
tank top no makeup we don't need makeup Hallelujah but I didn't expect it to
47:38
like go viral I'm hilariously in like a tank top and but
47:44
um and yeah so I posted it and it went like so viral even to this
47:51
day and um but I know like part of the reason it went viral was because I was
47:57
I was so in the mind of Christ I was so in the right perspective you
48:03
know and um yeah so anyways I went back to I went back to the the mountain and
Go back
48:11
I'm like just remembering that day how I was so blessed and
48:19
grateful for God touching people like a handful and that seems so tiny now
48:26
compared to one guys doing so it was just really humbling and so um yeah I
48:31
encourage you all to go back do what you need to do to go back go back physically
48:36
if you can it was really special for me to go back physically it was like returning to the stones and um but you might not be able
48:44
to go back physically that's okay but maybe you can look at pictures you know from the past maybe
48:50
you can look at a journal that you wrote you know you know do what you can to
48:58
return to those stones you know do like because to change your perspective is a
49:05
big thing it's not a small thing like to really get that mind of Christ in
49:10
you is not a small thing and and and I share that so you can know it takes effort it takes spiritual effort it
49:17
takes discipline it takes intention to be grateful to be
49:23
contentment to be humble to not be
49:29
entitled amen what can you do spiritually when people you live with are constantly talking negatively about
49:35
you to the point where you feel like it's been affecting your relationship with God so there's going to be certain
When your light makes demons angry
49:41
times there's going to be certain times like in your living space and in your workplace
49:47
where your light is going to make people mad because of the
49:53
Demonic oppression they have now if a person is open to
49:58
Jesus even if they have demonic oppression your light won't won't bother
50:05
them won't make them mad your light will bless them now there can be some people
50:11
who love God but they need deliverance and so in a moment they the demon leads leads them to speak something mean to
50:17
you or something like that but for the most part someone who who is open to
50:24
God who loves God but they need demonic you know their your light will bless
50:30
them but but people who are not open to God it's like the demons are really
50:36
controlling them like like so for a a Christian who has one demon or two
50:42
demons or three demons those demons are controlling certain aspects of them so it's addiction that the demon is
50:49
controlling that aspect if it's rage it's controlling
50:54
that aspect but not others you know but if a person is not a Believer and
51:00
they're not open to God it's like the demons are really like controlling kind of like all of them you
51:06
know so the demons are like I mean do you see when people come to church and
51:13
um do you see how people look at me demons in them look at
51:20
me I've never seen that kind of hatred before and anger in my life
51:28
as when I've as as how I've seen demons look me in the eye like I've never seen
51:34
it anywhere like it's it's wild demons hate the anointing the light
51:44
in you because it's what expels them and prohibits them from doing the job they're sent out to do it's what gets
51:51
them in trouble with the devil yeah so um
51:58
yeah I have a lot of people that I hear from a lot of people that are like they say that my voice annoyed them
52:07
or the way I look annoyed them and then but then God LED them to keep like
52:13
watching sometimes and then they were set free and then they realized now it was like the demons that didn't like how
52:18
I talked it was the demons that didn't like my eyes you know and even today that's why
52:24
I don't take a personal when I there's all these these Pharisees and everything there's so many Pharisees it's hilarious
52:29
I never expected this to be the attack of the Pharisees but the Pharisees so many times say there's something creepy about her eyes or something
52:36
or how she looks or her expressions like they'll say hilarious things like this
52:41
but it like makes so much sense you know it's they genuinely feel this way because it's the demons feeling this way
52:48
in them so we don't take offense to it amen we we want to make demons angry
52:57
that means that we are powerful in Christ Hallelujah so you got to be aware of that that there's going to be certain
53:03
people that are going to be mean to you for no reason when you have the light in you there's going to be people like in
53:08
the workplace or your home um especially where God is leading you to get a new apartment if that's a
53:16
possibility or find a new job because simply that like for if it's a job it's
53:23
a workplace you're at where like like all the people or most the people are not open to God and your
53:30
light is so bright that you are you are making them so angry at
53:36
you now that's not going to be all the time that's not going to be most of the time it's just going to be once in a
53:41
while so if you find you know um obstacles at work I
53:47
don't I don't mean for you to quickly think you have to find another job no no no because God um uses these things as
53:55
refining fire um a lot of the time but I'm just saying like if in some circumstances it could
54:01
be that the majority of the people are very against God where you're at perhaps
54:07
they're not open at all and they're just constantly like abusing you you know
54:13
like being mean to you for no reason in that situation God would want God would open up another door and it would be
54:20
better because it's going to be a reward because if you are shining your light so bright for him is making
54:26
this to take place the people to be mean and everything that means that you've done
54:33
well that means that God wants to reward you so you need to have faith and seek
54:38
and believe that God will open up for sure will open up a door and a Better Door amen and so for people you live
54:45
with it's kind of similar as what I just said but actually a little bit more different because God really wants you
Finding a roommate
54:52
to only bring people in very close in terms of like having like personal one-on-one
55:00
conversations for a long time and spending quality time with for a while like he wants those type of people to be
55:08
equally yolked it says in the Bible do not be equal unequally yolked and that's not just talking about marriage in that
55:13
scripture actually it's talking about in general so basically you have to protect
55:20
you have to protect yourself spiritually you don't want to bring in the the wrong people close and then they have lots of
55:26
doors open to the enemy and the enemy uses that person for in terms of living
55:33
situations you are bringing the person in close I mean lots of times you could just like go to the room and sometimes
55:39
that can be okay if the person's like respecting that boundary so it's not like you absolutely have to find a
55:46
roommate that is equally yed with you I don't mean that at all actually that can be difficult sometimes when you're in a
55:52
pinch needing a roommate so it's okay it's it's best if you can have a Believer as a roommate but you don't
56:00
need to like make sure they're perfect but you need to make sure you're really putting up boundaries but if it's in another situation where a person's
56:06
really not respecting boundaries then it's very important to look for another apartment to look for
56:12
another place if that is possible so if that is not possible like
56:18
if you are under 18 or maybe you're over 18 but
56:23
you're looking for a job you don't have the finances yet and everything like that then you need to trust that God is
56:29
protecting you and God is giving you extra Grace he's giving you more grace in this circumstance than he would give
56:34
someone whom he's telling them to like leave this apartment but they're not
56:40
right so like if you're if the provision isn't there yet or you're under 18 for
56:48
example you know you you have to stay and you know like God's that's God's will then right that's God's will so you
56:56
know in God's will is where his grace is so in that circumstance you can trust
57:02
that God's giving you extra Grace Extra Protection and he's going to use it for good he's going to use this as a
57:08
refining fire he's going to use this to mold you so it's the refining fire is
57:14
never comfortable so other people they have refining fire different ways they
57:19
have amazing living situation but they're having a different kind of refining fire but for you you don't have
57:25
a good living situation but that's what you're refining fire is so uh but also
57:31
you need to know what's temporary for sure when it comes to living situations because this is your daily
57:37
life it's very important you know you you're living with the right people
57:43
where the enemy can't use the people to hurt you you know so that's absolutely
57:49
God's will for every single believer eventually you know depending on your
57:54
circumstance depending on the timing so anyways live in that it's important to
58:00
live in that spiritual knowledge to know this is
58:06
temporary this is temporary God has has amazing living
58:13
situation for me like whether it's by yourself or with good roommates yada yada y whatever that's my future for
58:22
sure amen so that will help you just be strong put your armor of God in if
58:29
that's where you're at right now put your armor of God on and fight the good fight of faith and stay strong and lean
58:36
on Jesus Keep Your Eyes on him and he will help you he will give you all the strength you
58:42
need how to know when you have a friend you should bring in close well time is a
58:47
good test I mean I it's it's it's never wise to like let all guards down immediately just because like this is
58:54
talking this is talking about like fellow Believers so it's it's different from Servants of God because um like
59:03
with a servant of God God can really show himself and show lots of
59:09
fruits very quickly you know and can and and it's very important that
59:14
you are planted where God wants you to be and are being equipped like this is
59:20
urgent so God can speak this very quickly like show you the fruits really
59:25
quickly but when it comes to fellow
59:30
Believers it's important to give time to not go by
59:37
signs you know like to not quickly jump into signs like someone says God gave me a dream that you're um
59:46
supposed to be the person I bring in really close for life or something like
59:51
you know if someone says that that's a very like huge directional prophetic
59:58
word and you're not supposed to take huge prophetic directional words from
1:00:04
anyone but your spiritual leader or leaders because well first of all that's
1:00:10
God's order and number two many people they're not called to be
1:00:16
prophesying directionally if they're not called then anything's possible if you're not called
1:00:21
you don't have the grace to you don't have the grace to be like this is a word from God I know this is
1:00:28
not my own dream I know this is not the angel of Light this is a word from God it's like you don't have the grace for
1:00:36
that like for that kind of like discernment to then give the prophetic word when God hasn't given you when God
1:00:41
hasn't called you to prophesy a directional word we receive Grace where
1:00:48
in God's will like where he's calling us we can't just go do something over here that we want to do but God's not going
1:00:55
to God's Not calling us to do that and he's just going to be like okay here you go you want to operate as a prophet okay
1:01:02
here you go here's all the grace I give to my prophets cuz you want to do this here you go that's so silly if you think
1:01:08
about it God doesn't do that and so that's where people get in trouble because they go outside of God's will they do what they want they do how they
1:01:14
feel and God's not going to like be manipulated and that's that's the where the angel like can operate so yeah so
1:01:23
the the best thing you can do is just like give time like like you
1:01:28
know you don't have to let let all your guard down don't let all your guards down like
1:01:37
observe someone's fruits and that when it comes to fellow Believers you won't
1:01:42
see like immediately it takes time and then there's you know the pressure
1:01:49
reveals things like the when the fire is turned up it reveals things people can hide things you know so um that's the
1:01:56
way to walk in maturity in that to not rush it it's not that we need to have one to three or more very close friends
1:02:03
in our life at all times there will be times where God calls you to a solitary season even you you see David like with
1:02:11
with just God and him in the Valley of the shadow of death there's going to be sometimes where it's an isolated time of
1:02:19
you and God that that's just the season you're in where God hasn't ordained you
1:02:25
to bring in anyone in super close I don't mean that for every single person
1:02:30
there could be a time there could be every single season there is at least one person who you're very close and
1:02:36
that's how God wants it you know it just depends but I just want to say that don't feel like you have to force it
1:02:42
don't feel like what's important is that you're not isolating yourself like you're not like I just want to be alone
1:02:49
I don't want to be hurt anymore that's when it's a problem um because you're doing on your own accord but if God is
1:02:56
like just wanting it to be you and him in terms of very close intimacy for a season then
1:03:03
that's that's good that's what God wants so you don't so what I'm trying to say is Don't force it and look with the eyes
1:03:10
of wisdom give time you don't need to let all your guards down right away you shouldn't let all your guards down right
1:03:17
away and people have good Hearts many people have good Hearts but it's a process of transformation you know it's
1:03:24
a it's a process and so it's important that we're not seeing
1:03:31
everyone is like perfect and just letting our guards down just CU someone says they're a Believer you
1:03:38
know just because they're excited about Revival you know people are going
1:03:43
through through a process of transforming so um just walk in that
1:03:48
wisdom she says there are no new wine people near me very long season of
1:03:54
solitude over here she from upstate New York which is where I'm from and I never met a single person when I was there
1:04:01
that that had encountered God's power that had known about demons manifesting and being cast out of people that were
1:04:06
knew about baptism Holy Spirit I never met anyone and I went to a college where
1:04:12
I was so involved with the Christian Community there hundreds of them there I never met anyone whose eyes were
1:04:21
opened in this way until I moved to LA so anyways the the Lord is leading me
1:04:26
right now to to declare over you and Upstate New
1:04:32
York and the surrounding areas that this revival fire should
1:04:39
spread must spread let eyes open up let this
1:04:45
religious um Cloud over people's eyes be lifted and let hunger come in jesus'
1:04:54
name in jesus' name let Fire come and I speak
1:04:59
this to every one of you that are in dry places that are in significantly dry places small towns I came from a very
1:05:06
small town and um I know that's how it can be there too you know like a lack of
1:05:12
eyes opening up and the um the love of
1:05:18
just the love of just staying where you're at in Tradition and lack of openness to
1:05:25
the new so I speak that over all of you that are in small towns all of you that are
1:05:31
in dry areas maybe you're in big cities but they're very dry where you feel like
1:05:36
you haven't found anyone in person that their eyes are opened up
1:05:44
spiritually it's time going into 2025 it's time now for this to
1:05:52
change it the the Solitude season is over and this this area in the area of
1:05:58
being the only one in your town or your city that you know of that their eyes are opened
1:06:06
up God is going to be moving so powerfully as you unite together with
1:06:12
others in your own cities and towns in person
1:06:17
to expand this revival fire this is what he's going to be doing powerfully in
1:06:23
2025 so and I'm sure Lear more of this for the prophetic word of the year but I this is why I'm led prophetically to
1:06:30
speak this over to you Julie the last shall be first the
1:06:36
first shall be last God has graced me
1:06:42
to um you know be in the a last type of
1:06:48
place you know where it was so dry right the chances of
1:06:55
I opening up and everything would be small for me statistically or logically for my eyes to be opened up and
1:07:01
encounter God in power and everything so I declare the L shall be first over you
1:07:07
I declare a a special igniting a fire in your area and
1:07:13
that people would be drawn for you to receive this good news to receive this
