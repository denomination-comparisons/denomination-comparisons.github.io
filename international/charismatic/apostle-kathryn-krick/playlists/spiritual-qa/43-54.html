what is the spiritual key to stop bed weding in my boys Deliverance I've actually seen
0:07
several children uh be freed of of wetting the bed and
0:14
um just by just by either coming to where God's power is like at fivefold church
0:19
and receiving the anointing that destroys the Yoke or watching online just like here and so to renounce and to
0:28
position yourself where the anoint is and so I'm this is um a form of renouncing just like even
0:36
bringing this question uh here on this live right now so I detach your children from that and
0:43
I declare every spirit that is bringing this kind of Torment this type of
0:51
Torment in the night must leave them in jesus' name and I declare from now they
0:58
will not wet the bed I declare they will be able to wake up and use the bathroom
1:04
and have no more of these issues again in Jesus
1:09
name amen explain how to control the
1:15
tongue so you first need to really uh receive this word of God and take the
1:21
word of God seriously how it says the power of life and death is in the tongue and you know just the this the times in
1:28
the word where God talks about how we shouldn't curse and we shouldn't um
1:35
like curse God's name and that we should only speak life and we need to just be
1:43
reverent to that word of God number one number two beyond that even beyond the simple
1:52
obedience to God's word you must have this Revelation believe this word of God
1:58
and meditate on it this truth that your tongue really has so much power that you
2:05
really do have authority God's giv you Authority and one of the biggest ways to
2:10
execute your Authority is through your tongue is through the words you speak and so when you use your tongue
2:18
for good and you're declaring God's will you are literally executing your
2:25
Authority and you are literally helping to bring God's Kingdom more upon this
2:31
Earth and you are literally on God's Revival Army uh and you are really make
2:39
taking ground truthfully you really are doing such powerful things like in your
2:45
own spiritual life but even in general in this whole kingdom of God you are doing such powerful things when you're
2:51
using your tongue for good and and really walking in your Authority with your tongue but that also means that you
2:57
can't be speaking bad because you have bad words uh words of death because you
3:03
really do have authority in your tongue so it's it's it's an action of giving
3:08
the authority to the enemy when you speak words of death things that don't align with God's
3:15
Will and um it's it's opening doors so it's like when you open up a door that's
3:22
what allows the devil to bring attacks and bring oppression um and so
3:30
that's the action of giving him authority to do these things upon your life
3:37
so meditating on these truths is really the most important thing you can do if
3:42
you want to tame your tongue because everything flows from what you're thinking
3:48
about uh as a man thinketh as a man or woman thinks the Bible says so he is and
3:56
the Bible also talks about what comes out of your mouth stems from what's in
4:02
your heart what's in your mind so when you really get this into
4:07
you into your heart and your mind by meditating by choosing intentionally to renew your mind meditate on these truths
4:14
on the word of God on the Revelation that I've shared right now that comes from the word of
4:19
God you will change like you will be living in a different reality than you
4:25
were before you will be living in a different reality that the world lives in you will be living in a spiritual
4:31
reality God's reality you'll be spiritually minded so
4:36
you're like living your life like in a different realm than everyone else
4:42
spiritually minded spiritually thinking uh and so you'll be living in
4:48
this Revelation it's like you it's like this is the action of making of of of of of opening your eyes more and keeping
4:55
them open by meditating on these truths it's like you're keeping your your eyes opened so now you're staying continually
5:02
in a state of seeing in a different realm seeing in the spiritual realm not
5:07
just seen in the spiritual realm um like during a
5:13
message like a message right now you know where you hear a truth and you're like wow yeah that's true wow but then
5:21
you go back to real life and you step out of that realm of
5:28
this the spiritual realm and you step into the natural realm and just you're thinking nothing but the natural realm
5:33
realities instead of the spiritual realm realities uh so yeah so you need to
5:38
change you need to change your mind renew your mind and get your eyes to stay open up and then everything else
5:46
will flow from there your your your tongue will match your mind and so I remember like when I
5:54
really took this Revelation seriously it wasn't hard to change I
6:00
automatically became very quiet at first because number one I wanted to make sure I wasn't just carelessly speaking
6:07
because I was in a habit before of not being so intentional so first of all I
6:12
wanted to make sure I was really like cautious of what I was saying that I
6:17
wasn't saying anything bad any words of death anything carelessly that was number one and then once I had
6:24
disciplined myself and changed and gotten things out of my vocabulary I don't I don't really mean like um like
6:32
Square words they weren't in my vocabulary but I mean like um just simple things like maybe I'm afraid of
6:40
this I'm worried about this uh just simple things like that I I just stopped
6:46
saying those those types of words got them out of my vocabulary and just and then the next step was to change how I
6:52
spoke and and speak more life and speak more intentionally and speak with
6:57
authority so instead of I'm afraid I'm worried I don't say those things I feel those feeling maybe i' feel those
7:03
feelings but I would declare the opposite you know I declare um this will
7:10
be okay this will work out God is with me I am strong I'm courageous I am
7:17
Fearless things like that um yeah so
7:22
that's the biggest part about taming your tongue is getting your mind there first in the right
7:28
place and and staying in that place if we repeat what people tell us for example in the healthcare realm is that
7:33
speaking death we have to report What patients are saying Etc sometimes a patient says they are
7:40
unwell um and I say you are well and they look at me like I'm
7:47
crazy yeah so this is the thing like we are
7:52
in the physical world and we have physical bodies in this world and
7:58
doctors are are a good thing doctors are helping the physical body and ministers
8:05
and us in the spirit and th us Believers of God who are walking in the anointing
8:11
we deal with a spiritual realm which is the bringing the greater healing the
8:18
lasting healing the complete full healing by bringing the Gospel of Jesus
8:25
and bringing his kingdom to this earth the kingdom has come near to bring this complete healing uprooting
8:32
everything so the physical um healing that that that doctors bring they do
8:39
good and lots of times of course there's other things that we know aren't the
8:44
like you know let's say like there's a lot of drugs that are like really addictive and so many people I mean I've
8:49
heard stories you know of people getting so addicted they end up over doing right and um it's not like it's the doctor's
8:57
fault or anything but it's just like the the way that PE that that the that
9:04
physical doctors help the physical body it's imperfect it's there's problems it's not perfect
9:12
like the healing that Jesus brings you know um but that's not to say we just throw away doctors and the helping of
9:20
the physical body um for one thing a lot of people haven't come to Faith In Jesus
9:25
yet and but yet we still want people to be helped and without if they don't want Jesus if they
9:31
don't have faith that healing usually from Jesus usually isn't going to take place and so there's a time and place
9:38
for physical for doctors to help the physical body um and it's also not to
9:46
say that even when one is completely spiritual that we throw away doctors completely and we never go to a doctor
9:52
it's not to say that either but it's to say that we believe that Jesus is our
9:57
healer 100 100% we believe that we can go to Jesus for everything we we don't
10:04
we don't believe that there's one thing that well Jesus can't heal I need to go to the doctor for that no our faith is
10:09
that Jesus can heal everything um but that still even when our faith is that
10:14
strong it doesn't mean we throw away doctors um completely and we never do
10:20
anything um for our physical bodies in terms of like Health Care you know um so
10:28
you know it's important you don't think like um wrongly or like badly like it's
10:34
like like doctors in the healthcare system are like bad or something it's important you don't think that way and they are doing a lot of good and they're
10:40
helping people helping the physical body um so so um anyways like when you are in
10:49
the Health Care system and that's where you are and maybe God has one there they
10:55
can be a light there God can have them there for a purpose but at the same time it's like you your your field is the
11:03
physical um area and you know you can't force faith on people so you just kind
11:10
of have to you have to realize where you are and it's okay you know if that's
11:16
one's calling um but sometimes God May convict one like they really understand
11:22
the power of life and death in the tongue and it's really they feel just so much conviction that they feel this
11:27
isn't their calling there because they feel so passionately um to bring more of the spiritual Truth uh and be more
11:36
focused on the spiritual health God will call people to that too but others God can call to be there as a in the Health
11:44
Care system as a doctor and and and shine his light and sometimes maybe
11:50
minister to people I I've heard testimonies sometimes that people will you know sometimes patients will be in
11:56
desperation and there's like no answers a doctor can give and everything and sometimes uh like a nurse will like end
12:04
up talking with the the person and introducing them to God actually there was a story of I
12:11
remember this gentleman who was in the hospital really sick I forget what was
12:17
wrong with him but he was really sick and a doctor follows or a nurse follows
12:22
um fful Church follows my Ministry and told him about this Ministry my Ministry and he
12:30
started watching and he literally received Deliverance I actually prayed for him oneon-one and he received
12:35
deliverance and healing and then he started then he was out of the hospital and he came to 5f so there's beautiful ways that God can um you know use people
12:44
where they feel like limited but still there's opportunities for God to use them like a situation like
12:52
that so to answer really the question about like sometimes a patient says they're unwell and I say you are um
13:00
it's you know it's okay to go the physical route because that's the lane
13:05
you're in but be o if that's a if that's a nurse or a doctor but just be open to
13:12
these opportunities to share with a person spiritual truths um if they are
13:20
open not against their free will but if they are open how can we make sure we're not
13:26
eating in a religious way so your eating should just be with moderation I mean like you're eating
13:34
when you're eating you should generally be thinking like I want to eat healthy today I want to eat healthy I want my
13:41
meal to be healthy for every day most days or every day I want my meals to be
13:47
healthy now that doesn't mean you need to go on an extreme and like not eat
13:53
bread or something it doesn't mean but when I say eat healthy it doesn't doesn't mean like
14:01
only vegetables and like a really lean protein and a little bit of healthy
14:07
carbs or something for every meal I don't mean that I really when I say eat healthy I mean like your like your your
14:16
main meal like let's say like dinner or something let that um really uh nourish
14:24
your body like let that be uh like protein Let Let There Be
14:30
vegetables and I'm not a nutritional expert but you know all the things that let there be
14:38
fruit in your diet once in a while too like the things that really nourish our bodies that it's important to have a balanced diet in um make that
14:47
intention so and then and then you know you can have sweets but let it be like
14:53
very much in moderation and just be cautious that you're not going to the
14:59
point of out of self-control lacking self-discipline in the area um and do
15:07
you have an addiction and eating too much of it so um just be aware you
15:12
know probably having soda like every day
15:18
is not a good thing you know and probably just be you don't need to have like soda and um dessert and like load
15:28
on the sweets if you have sweets let it be like moderation not overload for example
15:36
um and then of course you can have a day here and there where you where it's not
15:43
as healthy maybe but that it's more of a rare thing and so that kind of general
15:48
rule just making that intention of I want to nourish my body I want my body
15:53
to be healthy I know that what I'm putting in my body really matters it's going to really have an effect on my
16:00
whole body and on my ability to even serve God the best way I can um and so that be your intention and
16:08
then also number two moderation so that you're not you you
16:13
don't need to be like hardcore and obsessive and like I can't eat this you
16:21
know that's where it might start to be religious or obsessive if you're getting in that area
16:28
so um really that you shouldn't have to think about food that much it like you should get to that place where you're in
16:35
a um habit of nourishing your body and
16:40
then occasionally like if you feel like oh maybe that sounds good this like
16:45
treat this sweet or something you can have it once in a while but you're not like um stressing like oh I don't know
16:53
if I should have this like you should get to this place where you're not like thinking so much about food but you've
16:59
trans you've you've transform you've been transformed where you know um you
17:05
know what you should give your body you know and when I say like you shouldn't be thinking too much about it that's I'm
17:11
what I'm saying is don't be religious CU if you're being religious you're like it's that same thing of like I have to
17:16
read um exactly this amount of the Bible today and read this I'm out pray for this amount of time and you're you're
17:22
like thinking too much about the you're obsessing over um like perfectionism
17:28
when there isn't even a that doesn't even exist you know it's flowing with the holy spirit with
17:34
everything and at the same time we are made in God's image and he gives us and he and and there's some choices we make
17:42
like it's not like God is saying eat this and then eat this and then eat this but God has made us in His
17:49
image and we can make he wants us to make choices on our own good choices he wants us to make good choices how can we
17:57
test our motives to be sure our hearts are fully pure not seeking any glory for ourselves and truly only wanting the
18:03
Lord to get all the glory well God will actually take you through tests and there's like a lot of
18:10
tests that we go through in this area a lot of um opportunities to for God to
18:15
test us and for us to test ourselves as God tests us like to see what our hearts are and that's usually when pressure
18:22
comes or waiting waiting period as well and when you come to a place of
18:29
two different things when you come to a place of like people not really noticing or seeing like what you're
18:35
doing um and maybe like you're doing powerful things for God but it's not being noticed it's not
18:42
being seen in these times it's a temptation of
18:48
uh humans to like really hunger for people to see
18:55
we feel like look what look what I'm doing I'm doing really good things and um I want Applause for this like that's
19:03
human nature so that thought comes to most most people um and it's not like
19:10
it's a bad thing it's like just like a n um it's just natural you know it's
19:17
natural um and it's not like it's a bad thing until we like act on it and let it
19:22
take over and so there can be times maybe you're being hidden by God you're in a waiting season
19:28
you're working hard you're doing so many things for God and maybe um even you're
19:34
having persecution come at you at the same time or it's like the opposite of what you should be
19:41
getting and in those times you might have start to feel these feelings like
19:47
people should see what I'm doing this isn't fair um but in those moments like
19:53
when you start to have those feelings that should be really a moment of looking to Jesus and like realizing
20:00
oh I'm having these feelings but you know what God sees and I'm doing this for the audience of one and so this
20:07
audience of one God Jesus he's here and he's seing and he's seeing it all and he's so proud and that's all that
20:14
matters it doesn't matter what other people think it doesn't matter about other people's Applause it doesn't matter and you know you you you look to
20:22
Jesus in these moments and then you renew your mind and then you should feel
20:27
peace then that's a good testing I'm not saying that it it means
20:33
it's easy but you should have peace and you shouldn't go in the other direction
20:38
where you you you find yourself really hungering approval from people um a
20:47
lifting um you know it to be seeing what you're
20:53
doing you shouldn't start obsessing and Desiring those things like more
20:58
but you should go the other way you have those moments where you're feeling these things it doesn't mean oh you have a bad heart when you're feeling these things
21:04
but it's what you do with it because it's human nature it's it's it's not
21:10
it's a weird thing to be doing you know many amazing things for God and working
21:15
hard for him and no one sees it and you feel like you're going in circles and
21:20
you feel like um there should be reward not in like a um weird way but you know you
21:28
just feel like God should reward you you know and it doesn't happen and it's just
21:33
human nature to feel like feel weird about it feel a little bad about it you know that's not it's
21:39
not it's not like oh you have a bad heart no it's what you do with it and so
21:45
in these moments I've had these moments I look to Jesus I renew my mind and I feel peace and I feel contentment and I
21:50
also feel conviction in those moments like you know this is just for the audience of one remember this and
21:58
um trust God it's his timing his promises are going to come to pass you
22:04
don't have to worry and also there will be Vindication you don't have to worry
22:09
there God will um bring Justice you don't have to worry um all of that you
22:16
know I I I I feel conviction renew my mind and then I it transforms you and
22:23
then I feel peace but other people when you don't have a good heart you become
22:30
you go the other way you become obsessive and people start acting out trying to force things um trying to be
22:36
seen doing things to be seen and everything so that's how you can test
22:43
your heart you you have tons of opportunities to test your heart sometimes it's every day sometimes
22:49
especially if you're like in a waiting season you have that opportunity pretty much every day because I know in the
22:54
waiting season it's sometimes it's like every day that thought comes to you of like I feel like I'm in a waiting room
23:00
and oh man I just can't wait till it's time but I have no clue when it's time
23:06
and I know that feeling it's it it can pass your mind every day um so you have
23:12
a lot of opportunities but it's what you do with it that's how you can know have peace have peace it's still it's still
23:18
okay to hunger and sometimes you know feel like o this is hard The Waiting um
23:25
this is hard the the place of being hidden it's okay to feel those feelings but you should have peace and
23:31
contentment through it all yeah you can also know the the condition of your
23:37
heart the purity of your heart also like when you choose to not complain
23:43
like when you choose to complain to God or to other people and you choose to like mope To God Be mopy and and
23:52
whine when you KN when you know better you know what I mean like you're just doing this to feel to feel feel good or
23:58
something but you know the truth like you know you can trust God you know you're just in the waiting season and
24:04
the time will come and God's time is perfect but you just can't help yourself
24:09
it that's kind of like an indicator of some little selfishness there and
24:15
um like a little immaturity spiritually uh that's an indication so
24:21
if you find yourself like that no you need to repent and turn to Jesus and ask him to help you um like grow more mature
24:30
and um be content and be patient and be at peace and not care about how other
24:35
people see you and success and all of that but just pleasing him and being in
24:41
his will there's a family member who suffers with anxiety and mental health issues also is a Believer I prayed for
24:47
her but she continues to say she has it and tells me she needs me and her life is this a toxic Soul
24:55
tie so in general you know Jesus kept only
25:00
three people very close to him and then he had 12 disciples that were close but not as close as the three and those 12
25:08
were spiritually mature and then those three were even more spiritually mature
25:15
so Jesus ministered to the masses but he wasn't bringing in close like close in
25:23
his personal life hanging out spending time with in anyone except really the 12
25:29
on a regular basis the 12 and then even more so the three and those 12 disciples
25:34
they were pretty darn spiritually mature I mean that they were the chosen Apostles um like leaders in the body of
25:41
Christ so they were pretty darn mature you know so I don't know that should that should really speak to us today
25:48
about the people that we bring in close and that we should not feel um ashamed
25:53
or religious about putting up boundaries so
25:58
never underestimate the power of loving people while having boundaries
26:05
up and never underestimate the importance of having
26:11
boundaries and um only calling those only bringing those really close whom
26:16
God is calling you to bring really close when you go against that and bring
26:22
people in close that God's not calling you to bring in close you are bringing
26:27
on unnecessary attacks from the devil that God didn't want you to have
26:35
but you know you find like for example if a person is talking so much negative all the
26:41
time what you listen to really affects you it's comes in you know so if you're
26:48
putting an ear to all the negativity even if you don't agree with it it it does have an effect on you
26:56
um but but it wouldn't if like what that happens just once in a while let's say
27:01
towards someone who's spiritually mature that's close to you and they're just going through a hard time or something and this is a moment that you're
27:07
strengthening them in the Lord because be there's a Grace over that
27:13
because God did call you to bring that person in close but those that God's not calling you to bring in close in your
27:19
life there's not Grace over it so it it opens the door it brings unne unnecessary taxs from the devil and so
27:25
you can be living a daily life in putting so much negativity in darkness that is really having an effect on you
27:32
and you don't you don't think it's such a big deal but over time it it has an effect has an effect so um you know just
27:43
just walk with wisdom with uh putting up boundaries healthy boundaries Still
27:48
Loving the person amen when you serve after your parents told you not to post is that
27:54
opening a door because I know Jesus has to respect your parents but I know also about serving the anointing so the Bible
28:00
says to that we should honor our parents but that but then the Bible also says
28:06
that um Jesus says I came to bring I don't have the scripture in front of me but the scripture says something like
28:12
I'm I'm coming to bring sword between family members like something like mother against son father against
28:19
daughter or something like I've come to bring a sword between them I've come to
28:24
like bring division between them well that what that's saying is really is
28:30
that um I've come to find my children who will
28:38
surrender their lives to me and that will mean that I'm giving everyone Free Will so that will mean that there are
28:45
some people and they can be family members that aren't on the same page that aren't completely surrendered and
28:51
so that will mean that there will be um there will be times
28:58
of like a sword brought in between like misunderstanding you know if a child is
29:07
loving Jesus talking about Jesus and the parent doesn't that can be a difficult
29:14
situation that you know that's really the meaning of this and um you know
29:20
Jesus says that my true family are those who do the will of the Lord and he says
29:26
that right after referring to his own biological family he's really making a point like you you must realize like
29:32
your true family in Christ are those who do the will of the Lord um so you you
29:38
can't like compromise your faith just because um close family members don't
29:47
believe in Jesus and don't want you to believe you you can't compromise your faith so
29:55
um when it comes to when when that situation is happening and just that's a
30:01
situation where you have to trust God to talk about Jesus to testify about him
30:06
and just trust that he's going to bring Supernatural Grace and protection over you now if you're like it's a different
30:14
story if you're like talking about your parents or something um and it's causing
30:20
them to um feel like you're speaking against them or something like that that's a different situation but if
30:26
you're simply talking about Jesus and what he's done for you in your
30:31
life he's absolutely calling you to share your testimony and you have to
30:36
believe that he will protect you and he will bring Supernatural Grace over you have faith that he his favor is upon you
30:46
and he will uh really help you in this situation he will miraculously come and
30:52
do things you didn't expect in this situation I prefer to eat gluten-free food because it makes my stomach feel
30:58
better should I be able to eat all foods or does God give certain people certain diets well I do know that there are uh
31:07
gluten allergies and so that's not of God a gluten
31:13
allergy and generally um most people are able to eat
31:19
things that have gluten in it and it doesn't like bother them right and so if
31:26
something's like really bothering you it's different when like
31:31
um like this is a little bit of science I've like learned recently actually so I
31:36
don't I'm not a science professional but when you are eating really healthy like
31:44
really like lots of um like like uh like if you don't eat a burger
31:50
for a really long time and you're eating like really healthy things and then you eat a burger your like the I forget what
31:57
it's called but there's like the things in your stomach um that help you digest
32:03
it like kind of um changes and that's like not a bad thing but it can change
32:08
and so if you eat a burger it can like make you not feel the greatest and it's
32:13
not like that's a problem that's it's just like you're eating healthier and so
32:19
your body is just changing to fit how you're eating and
32:25
everything um so like that might happen if one chooses to eliminate certain
32:31
things out of their body and that's not like it's a bad thing or anything but if you like your whole life maybe have
32:38
noticed that um maybe there's a gluten allergy maybe something like that then
32:44
that's something God wants to heal you from and it's it's good to desire complete healing in every area so
32:50
there's just no thing like let's I don't know let's say like you're in a situation um um
32:59
like I don't know maybe you're just on a vacation or something and it's just
33:04
you're not in a situation where it's is easy to get this the food that you usually eat let's say you're just in the
33:11
situation and you know like on certain like excursions or something they have a prepared meal for you there you know
33:18
something like that or maybe you're on this like long hike with a friend and the friend brought something that has
33:23
gluten in it or something so we should want to get to a point where um we don't we don't have to worry about like food
33:31
what it's going to do to us you know um like believe in complete healing in that area for circumstances like that so it's
33:39
it's good if you had problem with certain foods before it's good to renounce them and believe complete
33:45
healing even if you don't choose to eat that food on a regular basis maybe that certain food isn't the most healthy for
33:52
you but we should get to that place where we want we're believing and receiving the full healing that Jesus
33:58
Paid the price for leaving nothing on the ground but grabbing it all receiving
34:05
it all Apostle when I noticed that my flesh is so strong in an area say anger and speaking bad things to stop this
34:12
from happening do I need to get away and immediately pray instead how can I stop this so this is so much the also what I
34:21
sh answered in the beginning about the question about how to control your tongue it's very similar thing
34:28
of being spiritual so be be spiritual and and realize there's something that's
34:36
not spiritual in you there's something that's very carnal in you this way that you react in Anger is very
34:43
carnal and not spiritual and this there needs to be change here and this is like serious this is really really serious
34:51
like not to be taken lightly because this can be opening up a door to
34:56
to a demon like having this carnal part of you remaining it should be like
35:03
911 this is an emergency like we got to take care of this we got to really take this seriously not this like oh well
35:11
this is normal or oh I've always had this and oh so many people have this no when you're spiritually you realize we
35:17
have to get this taken care of so uh run to Jesus and be open with him and share
35:25
Lord I recognize this carnal part in me and I don't want this anymore I want to
35:30
be like you in this area I don't want to lash out an anger I don't want to speak the words of death um I don't want to uh
35:37
be even a vessel of the enemy sometimes accidentally I don't want this Jesus I really don't want this and I need your
35:43
help so really invite him in and then you have to take action you need to
35:48
meditate on the word of God spend spend more time spend more time in the word
35:54
and uh position yourself where the anointing is like these lives or watch the replays input more of God in you and as
36:04
you input more of God as you bring more of God in you it literally makes your spirit man to rise and be stronger
36:10
because what's happening is if there's this this rage that keeps happening and it's not a demon um if it's not a demon
36:18
it's your because because there can be a spirit of Rage that overtakes you that you will be free of by the anointing
36:24
that destroys the Yoke and I would declare this over you but um I see you here on the lives all the time so I
36:29
believe you are free and this is just an area of uh flesh that is stronger that
36:35
needs to be pushed down and it's just been a habit for so long a way of like responding and feeling uh um feelings
36:43
that you felt for so long that that's why it feels it's like stronger so
36:51
um you so you need so the more you input God bring God in re receive the
36:57
anointing receive the word is literally making your spirit man stronger and pushing that carnal man down that part
37:03
that takes over like it feels really strong and you act on it it will
37:09
diminish so that's one of the important things is that you just get your spirit stronger so in the moment with that
37:16
temptation to lash out an anger um the Temptation is small and you're able to
37:23
have control over it you're able to not do that choose to not do that um that's the big one and number
37:30
two really make intention in this specific area like realize this is a
37:36
problem that we are taking care of me and Jesus I'm taking care we are taking care of this meaning you're taking care
37:42
of it because this is a big part of like you need to take that you need to take the action the intention and the action it's not just like God fix me change
37:50
this in me you really have to take care of this you have to take action so so
37:57
make this a priority in your life like wake up in the morning and renew your mind and think you today I'm going to be
38:05
spiritual I'm not going to be carnal I'm not going to lash out in anger if a situation arises I will not you meditate
38:12
on this you can declare these things I'm only going to speak life if anything um
38:18
happens to me that I might get offended or upset about I will always keep my
38:23
peace because I know God's in control he's in control situation there's nothing to uh get that upset about and I
38:32
only want to speak life towards others and myself and my future so you you take
38:37
that intention so it's in the Forefront of your mind so that when the situation arises
38:43
it's already there you've already done the preparation in the spiritual realm to make your spirit man be strong and
38:50
your carnal man be pushed down and especially in that area you have like a hold on it you you know you're pressing
38:57
it down not letting it get out of hand toxic relationships friendships how how
39:03
to escape do the uncomfortable thing be strong and set up boundaries and be
39:09
unashamed of it and do it with love and gentleness and understand that
39:14
people might not fully understand people might be offended people might try to manipulate
39:20
you um but you have to be strong you have to be aware that that may happen
39:26
and you have to prepare yourself that you're not going to stoop down to be stoop down to that level and allow
39:32
yourself to be manipulated and see this as obedience to God this will give you strength is it
39:39
the same with complaining with what I was speaking just a little bit before I think they're asking when I was talking about rage how to get a control on
39:47
rage anger they're asking is it the same with complaining I feel that overtake me
39:52
I often do it even though I know it's wrong yes
39:58
exactly so coming to Jesus and being naked before him even though like you're conf the fact that you're confessing
40:03
this is powerful because many times the carnal nature in that area
40:09
stays strong because you let it stay strong but by you saying I see you and I
40:16
know this is wrong and I don't want you there that's giving the that's making it
40:22
lose its power and that's action of humility and
40:27
repentance so it's powerful even what you did to just confess that but yeah it's the same thing with what I just
40:34
explained you in a habit of doing this so in order to break this habit you
40:40
really need to make serious intention invite God in and make this serious intention realize this isn't going to
40:46
change unless I make serious intention to do this because we go about our days
40:53
day after day we we don't take intent ention with many things we're in this just routine this same routine and so
41:01
you need to make the decision like intervention in your life like this is an intervention
41:08
like I'm not going to let another day pass with just going through the motions and staying the same but I am taking
41:15
intention now I am taking action now write it down get a journal write it
41:22
down and say this is my new routine for this week for this month so I can get
41:28
this taken care of with Jesus this can get out of my life that's the only way
41:34
it will change is if you make that serious intention because it is the it is the
41:40
transforming of your mind the renewing of your mind the transforming of your of your soul that these things CH change
41:49
the change comes but the transforming of your soul it takes intention the intention is spending time time in the
41:56
word Renewing Your Mind and realizing there's a problem going to Jesus inviting him in and taking that
42:02
attention in that specific area I will not do this I'm going to be different I can be different because God is in me
42:09
and he's going to give me all the help I need I am going to be different I'm not going to do this anymore today and you
42:15
realize okay maybe it'll be uncomfortable maybe it'll feel weird but you don't care you you you're coming face to face with this you're being
42:22
strong and you are just doing it just doing it and you will see the
42:28
transformation renew your mind always too that this is obedience to God this is about loving God and obeying him
42:34
above all it's it's not about like making yourself better you know
42:42
um it what it is above above all things is obedience to God and your love for God and when and that changes everything
42:49
that's what gives you the strength to do these things to take the intention to do the uncomfortable things is when you realize this is what it's all about if
42:55
got called a husband or wife to be planted at a church like 5f does that mean that God will also call the other
43:02
spouse to be planted there as well yes you are one this is very important yes
43:07
but the thing is is that God gives free will and sometimes there can be
43:12
unequally yolked um relationships and that will cause there to be
43:19
sometimes like division in that area but be patient be patient and Trust God and
43:28
trust trust that God is working and that in in the right
43:33
timing it will happen if someone gets like 50 confirmations of strange events
43:39
within the same hour is that the angel of Light because I know God is gentle with his voice something to be aware of if you if
43:47
the angel of Light has spoken to you in an area so strongly generally God will not speak to
43:53
that you speak to you in that area for a while for your good to help you be completely free of
44:02
confusion for example I remember that when I first heard the voice of God when I started to
44:09
hear the voice okay not the voice of God when I started to learn how to have a
44:14
relationship with God cuz I had no clue how to have a relationship with God I just heard people saying relationship
44:20
with God relationship with God relationship with God and I I was like I don't know what that's like um it's not talked about much in the church they
44:26
just say it they just say it over and over over again the religion's bad a relationship with God and a lot of people like me would
44:32
feel insecure like how come everyone knows and I don't know how to have a relationship um but you know and I grew
44:39
up in a Presbyterian church so there was no such talk of relationship with God it was just like say your prayers at night
44:45
and at dinner time and at meals and go to church on Sundays and stuff and like
44:51
do the repeat after me prayers and stuff so um but then once I uh started going
44:58
to other churches and that weren't like so traditional but they started to use a
45:03
language of relationship with God not religion I was still like lost right so I remember um I got this
45:10
book I was reading this book age 20 in
45:16
college and it was talking about this author made up this um this term when
45:23
God Winks at you or God winks and it was basically talking about the power of
45:29
coincidence that many coincidences are not just coincidence but they're Gods speaking and then once I read that I'm
45:35
like oh that's a way that God speaks and I was like wow I've God's been speaking
45:40
to me a lot and I didn't realize it and then I started seeing him in so many things and I mean I started seeing coincidences all the time and being like
45:47
I saw this and this and God spoke to me here and but then
45:52
um but then like that was like the only way that I I like knew how to like hear
45:58
God and um that's just all I knew and so I was like almost obsessed kind of with like
46:07
those coincidences and everything and um at that time of my life this was age 20
46:13
I'm 32 now almost 33 in one month
46:20
and fast forward a couple years a couple years of after 20 so like
46:27
23 is 23 is around that time so this is
46:32
like a couple years before receiving the prophecy and meeting my spiritual father receiving my prophecy to be that I was
46:37
called to be an apostle so I'm out in LA and I'm and I
46:42
at this point I was pursuing being a singer and I felt really like lost and
46:49
like really wanting Direction with what to do next in terms of pursuing this uh
46:55
career and I just felt like oh I just I just need direction and and long story short
47:03
long story short um a bunch of coincidences happened like I was like I
47:08
really need direction and I was in the in a coffee shop that day and this I ran
47:14
into a person I knew from a church I went to but I I got I had kind of like red flags
47:20
about that person you know just in general just like I just feel like I didn't like in my heart like Trust you
47:26
know um and this person out of nowhere was like you know what you need you need an investor and I was like I can't
47:33
believe this I was just thinking like I need advice and Direction and out of nowhere he just speaks this and it was
47:40
just so strange and I'm like I ran into him out of in La is such a big city it's a huge City and I don't know that many
47:45
people I lived in La for just a couple years and I ran into him this and I didn't even tell him
47:51
I'm looking for direction and this is a Christian on top top of this from a
47:57
church and he's actually in this music industry too so he like knows and I was like whoa this is crazy
48:06
this is a God wink and then um I ended up at a coffee shop another different
48:13
coffee shop uh a couple hours later and I'm writing a song from my um my friend my
48:21
friend's wedding that I was going to sing at and I was I was writing it I was
48:26
outside sitting at a c you know uh outside of the table some person interrupts me like from a different
48:33
table and is like if you scowl too long like that it'll stay like that and you
48:38
know someone could be joking but it's actually it's inter looking back it felt like a a red flag just like how it was
48:45
spoken and it wasn't really like with love it was kind of weird and um it was
48:51
this it was this man and he ends up saying out of nowhere that he's an investor and then um long story short I
49:01
um wasn't walking in the wisdom of God back then this was way long ago before I have grown in wisdom as I have
49:08
now and I before I had a spiritual father and everything I was very naive at that time and um he ended up um
49:17
saying let's go to this studio down the street and this person has worked with huge people and everything and so I
49:23
literally like didn't know this person and and all in the name of like God winks and signs it was such the craziest
49:32
coincidence that could there could ever be and I ended up going to the studio and um then this guy I iend I ended up
49:40
being in the car with him and be all because I'm thinking God wink signs and he ended up
49:47
like I I was in a really compromised um situation where God just protected me
49:52
and he tried to um he like tried to like har sexually harass me in the car and
49:59
nothing happened I was protected but it was only God's protection that I was by his grace that I was
50:05
protected and um it was like in that moment and and
50:10
not only that but the manipulation that he was speaking to try to like abuse me to try to get me to do
50:18
like do anything with him was like the like it felt like the the um the snake
50:26
in the garden that's all I could think about and I never experienced that in my life like I felt like the snake in the garden and that was a really um eye
50:32
openening moment for me where I mean these things were the most intense coincidences coincidences that I I
50:39
couldn't I mean I'm trying to share them with you but there's even more that I'm not like it it was just the craziest
50:46
coincidences ever ever ever ever ever and for years I've been like coincidence
50:53
God coincidence God and they were always like precious things beautiful things and you know um I mean I even made like
51:00
an Instagram page back then about like God Winks I mean I was just obsessed with these coincidences and that moment really
51:09
opened up my eyes so much like man the devil could
51:14
absolutely the devil knows he hears me talk god wins God Wings coincidences the
51:20
devil knows like he's not he's not stupid the devil's really not stupid he
51:27
really is like smart in the spiritual realm like he's been around for a long time he's not like lacking in mental
51:32
ability or something to like like he the the Bible talks about how he is so cunning he he's the father of Lies which
51:40
means he is the most crafty of manipulation of um counterfeit to try to
51:47
make something look real you know what I mean so God really opened up my eyes that day
51:53
and not like to know that the devil can absolutely use this so you can't just be blinded like it's a sign not just that
52:00
but that you can't be like a robot and be like blindly like it's a sign it's
52:07
God you know um and you have to really be careful that you're not so hungry to
52:13
hear God's voice how you want and when you see signs you get all
52:20
excited like maybe this is God you have to be careful that you're not opening up a door with your own imagination and the
52:25
angel of Light uh in these you know in this with this
52:31
area so all that being said after that happened it was so amazing God really
52:38
grew Me grew like I grew in so much wisdom where I stopped obsessing over
52:45
signs I stopped obsessing over coincidences it really like open my eyes woke me up and especially then when I so
52:54
I had already really transformed a couple years in that area before meeting my um spiritual father and receiving the
53:00
prophecy over my life but then just growing a lot of what I share with you comes so much from walking with my
53:07
spiritual father and growing in wisdom and learning things from him and even observing him I taught you all about how
53:13
you really should be smart and pay attention to what your spiritual parent doesn't talk about too like maybe you
53:20
really want your spiritual father to talk about something in politics or something maybe they're not maybe there's a reason
53:25
like for example you know um pay attention to what oh your spir you know
53:32
your your spiritual parent isn't talking about look at signs signs signs sign signs signs maybe there's a reason you
53:37
know your your your spiritual parent isn't saying like look at visions and dreams and God
53:43
brings Visions God brings dreams but things are happening prophetically
53:49
like right now in this in this revival like the the way God has me Shar the the
53:55
things that I'm teaching about that's an indicator focus on these things if I am not teaching something
54:02
specifically but you really want to know about it that's probably an indicator that God isn't focused on this right now
54:09
for example like the return of Jesus
54:15
Christ God does not want me to right now talk so much about like his return
54:24
happening like right now because we have to have the Revival Army the end time
54:31
the end time Revival and the the Army has to be prepared and built up to bring in the Harvest and there will be a great
54:39
harvest not a one day one month one year two year fivey year Harvest it's going
54:45
to be a great harvest that spans across quite a long span of time so if we are
54:52
distracted on the wrong things like all these things are important all these things all of these um these things in
54:59
the word of God are important every B every chapter is important every topic
55:04
is important visions and dreams they're important um The Return of Jesus is
55:10
important and everything that the pre-trib tribulation all that all those topics they're important you know but
55:17
they have a time and place in prophetic seasons and we have to be aware that the
55:25
the season we're in is a prophetic season and time A Space in Time where God's like having us be more focused on
55:31
a certain a certain uh aspect of his kingdom more than other Seasons before
55:38
and after us because of where we are in the time span of Eternity and God's
55:45
purposes and plans right so um anyways like my
55:51
spiritual father like growing like Dr Propet Dr J Davy like listening to him
55:57
and also paying attention to what he's not talking about paying attention to things that he's not teaching like pay
56:03
like um like the thing like paying attention to what to the things he's not saying paying attention to the silence
56:09
and stuff has really taught me a lot has really taught me a lot um so
56:18
anyways As I Grew as I then was growing I started noticing that my spiritual
56:23
father wasn't talking about like signs signs signs look for God in signs yes God can move in signs yes God
56:30
does move in signs sometimes but um it's super important to not become obsessed
56:37
with that and be so focused on that um like for me I I felt really convicted
56:45
from God from after that whole experience I I explained to you how to
56:50
really not be not close my eyes off to signs but not be so like looking for
56:55
signs and when I stopped looking for signs but just became neutral and open I didn't see signs so
57:03
much and it and God spoke to me like I'm not speaking to you in this way now like
57:09
I'm speak I speak in different ways uh and so
57:14
um even continuing still like once I received the prophecy and I came underneath my spiritual father it it
57:20
really remained that same way where um it wasn't so much signs yes
57:27
signs can happen happen from a time to time but not such a strong Focus there
57:34
um and so and I also just want to share once again like if the angel of Light
57:39
has really like spoken so much in in a certain area God really cares about you
57:45
not being in confusion so um God wants to make sure you're not being deceived
57:51
again that you're really transformed before he starts to speak speak in this area that you were so easily deceived by
57:57
the devil in he'll speak to you in different ways and ways that you make that it's like a safe place like that
58:04
like for example when you're really growing the a big the big way that he is
58:09
going to be speaking so much is through your spiritual mother or father Your Leader your teacher your pastor your
58:16
Apostle like because that's like the safe place right that's like that's like the safe place like that's in coming
58:22
from the place of maturity that's not coming from a place of like trying to figure out God's voice it's coming from
58:27
such a place of like maturity and so you can have like trust there and also not just maturity but
58:34
it's prophetic it's prophetic and so it's really specifically like like
58:41
concrete like this is what God's speaking now and so to put weight there
58:46
to to put a lot of weight there is important and many times when you're
58:51
growing that's will be the big way that God's speaking and so it's important and you're not like too hungry for God to speak in all
58:58
these different ways when God is actually choosing to speak in this way to help you not be confused and not be
59:05
easily deceived by the angel of Light or your imaginations but to help you and to get you into that strong foundation and
59:11
really grow into maturity and then later he can bring other things and speak to you in different ways
59:17
but right now when you're in that place of not being strong with the discernment
59:22
yet um you were place of being deceived by the angel of Light it's going to be
59:27
coming speaking I mean the word of God is going to come mostly through your Your Leader your spiritual father and
59:33
mother the teachings amen what isn't said actually
59:40
says volumes yeah and I that's why humility is really important that's why humility is so important to Growing
59:47
because like oh we got the thumbs up again yes humility is important to grow
59:54
que it deserves of fireworks for that word of God
1:00:01
yes oh man um these are fun these Instagram q&as right but yeah like I
1:00:07
look back and I see um I see just like my humility towards my spiritual father like I really um saw
1:00:16
him is so much higher spiritually than me like rightfully so in a good humble
1:00:21
place right in my heart and so I like paid attention to him like to what he
1:00:27
said to what he didn't say I really like paid attention he
1:00:33
became my teacher just watching him and listening
1:00:39
listening to what's not being said and so I I
1:00:47
um like having that humility of like I don't know better he knows better
1:00:55
so it started to teach me like oh even I didn't have to ask him things I didn't have to ask him things sometimes but
1:01:02
having humility and and observing you
1:01:08
learn it's not rocket science it's not difficult you learn you learn the things
1:01:15
that he's not focusing on that I thought maybe was important oh
1:01:21
it's not important but that comes from humility if you don't have humility you can think
1:01:28
oh well maybe they're missing something oh but I know that this is so
1:01:33
important so maybe they're maybe they're not talking about it you make excuses but
1:01:40
when you're really humble through and through you're you come to this place of I could be wrong in so many different
1:01:46
areas I could have old wine skin in so many different areas I mean everything could be wrong I that's that's real
1:01:52
humility and you but but this I know is truly a servant of God that God has
1:01:57
truly called me to be planted under to learn from to be like follow me as I follow Jesus so God has called me to
1:02:04
follow follow him or her this is what God's called me to do so I'm looking I'm
1:02:10
watching I'm following I'm not coming like maybe they don't know about this that's not humble at all and that's
1:02:17
prideful what to do if you do not have any spiritual mother or father in your life and no one who is qualified well
1:02:24
there's misconception that you have to be like that a spiritual father or mother you need to be with personally
1:02:30
and um like even like have contact and communication with them
1:02:36
personally um that may be important in
1:02:41
some situations um like when it's like if
1:02:47
it's one's calling to be a five-fold
1:02:52
minister um to to lead their own Ministry or to be a part of a
1:02:59
Ministry uh like where the spiritual father or mother leads to maybe lead a
1:03:05
branch or something like that that would be important to have personal contact
1:03:11
but for the majority of Believers that's not the case or maybe if they are called to be a fful minister it's not their
1:03:18
time right quite yet and so even if one is um has a huge calling to be an
1:03:28
apostle or Prophet uh it doesn't mean that um it's
1:03:35
their time yet to step into that place and it doesn't even mean it's time yet for them to you know being having having
1:03:42
like personal contact with the spiritual father or mother so for the majority of
1:03:48
Believers um because fold Ministry is more of a a a like a like minority of
1:03:55
Believers so for most Believers really in the spiritual realm
1:04:00
it is not necessary to have personal contact with the spiritual father and mother but your spiritual father mother
1:04:06
becomes your father and mother spiritual father and mother when you plant yourself in their Ministry and you are
1:04:14
surrendered to God there like you've really committed yourself to be planted there and you really are humble and
1:04:22
reverent to God to like his ministry there and Leadership there and you really recognize like
1:04:30
you've seen by the fruits that the leader of the ministry is true servant of God they are really truly a servant
1:04:37
anointed servant of God and so then there is trust there and then um they
1:04:43
become your spiritual father or mother and um it is an it is prophetic
1:04:49
anointing moving flowing there so there will be so much that's taken care of in
1:04:56
your spiritual life in terms of like questions uh and that just things that need to be done in the spir in your
1:05:01
spiritual life will just naturally happen as you're there listening to these prophetic teachings that God knows
1:05:07
you need and the anointing released there um helping with your own spiritual
1:05:13
life like breaking off yolks and also releasing covering of protection this is
1:05:18
what many people don't know but I mean you are you are really taken care of and
1:05:24
have more than enough uh when you are really planted there and
1:05:31
you have that spiritual father or mother there uh you have more than enough all
1:05:37
all that you need um and it's really you're really being fed spiritually and
1:05:42
even if you like feel like you want certain questions answered or something but
1:05:47
they're not it doesn't it it may mean sometimes that it's not timing that God it's not timing for that answer
1:05:54
answer yet you don't need to have that answer yet or maybe sometimes people have questions out of just they they
1:05:59
want to they want something to be true or something and uh like in a stubborn way um but they just need
1:06:08
to uh accept what God has for them now and not and accept that just like let go of
1:06:16
this amen so yeah so you can have a spir so
1:06:21
where you plant yourself that becomes your spiritual father or mother how do we transition from our current Church to 5f we are willing and ready to
1:06:27
begin this process and plan to speak to our pastor to be dismissed how do we connect to the body at 5f so email us at
1:06:32
info@ 5f church.org um I'm not sure if you live in LA or not
1:06:38
but you can be planted whether you live physically in LA or not and so we have a email that we will send to you once you
1:06:45
email us if you live outside of La if you live in LA just come and talk to
1:06:51
Jean tall uh talk to Jean tall uh who I think you most of you you probably know
1:06:56
she is if you don't she's worship leader she sings worship every time next to me and is on the
1:07:02
camera so just come talk to her after church is it okay to renounce things from my husband's side of the family
1:07:08
even if we've not lived together for the past two years but are still legally married it's always okay to renounce it's always good to renounce in fact
1:07:13
it's better to over renounce I mean the sometimes if you leave something
1:07:20
without renouncing it that's that's where the devil still has legal access
1:07:25
so it is very important to take renouncing seriously in marriage you can renounce things because you were one
1:07:33
even if even if um you know you haven't lived together for a little bit still
1:07:39
renounce still renounce and renounce any demonic Soul tie as well how do react
1:07:46
when one thinks you're goodie to shoes just because you have the character of Christ the things of the world are the
1:07:54
the things of the spirit the things of the spirit are foolish to the carnal mind to the
1:08:01
worldly mind so to have Godly character is seen as
1:08:09
foolish by the people in the worlds so if you're surrounded by people in the worlds a lot maybe you're forced to like
1:08:14
to be in school to be in a place like school or the workplace then you have to renew your mind a lot because you'll
1:08:20
feel like out outnumbered you'll feel like you're the weird one one but you are not the weird one you should be so
1:08:27
proud you should be so proud to be to be Godly you should be so um I mean proud
1:08:34
in a humble way I mean like like thank you Jesus for making me this way thank
1:08:39
you Jesus that I don't have open doors thank you Jesus that I'm able to please you and touch your heart with how I live
1:08:46
and how I'm like you with the words I speak thank you Jesus you really should
1:08:52
live this way this is how I live like I I look around just being grateful if I'm
1:08:59
ever you know in public looking around I just feel so grateful that God opened up
1:09:05
my eyes I see so many people whose eyes aren't open and I just feel thank you Jesus for opening up my eyes use me to
1:09:11
help these people thank you Lord for opening my eyes I used to be this way I used to be lukewarm I used to be in the
1:09:18
world thank you Jesus for opening my eyes so now I I can be pleasing you touching your heart I can be in
1:09:24
obedience to you I can be doing things for your kingdom and I can have doors shut to the devil I can live an abundant
1:09:31
life so you really need to renew your mind about this truth if you are you know in around worldly people a lot that
1:09:38
are maybe making fun of you for being Godly you really got to renew your mind you really got to thank God be grateful
1:09:44
in this area and renew your mind that you're not you're not the weird one you
1:09:51
know you're I mean you're you're the you're you're pleasing pleasing to God you're pleasing to God um renew your
1:09:58
mind with this so that whenever that comes you just that scripture Pops in your head right there oh this is the the
1:10:03
the the things of the spirit are foolishness to the people in the world I'm foolish to them but I'm un ashamed
1:10:08
to be foolish to look foolish amen and you are even planting
1:10:13
seeds you are planting seeds because people will remember you in the future when they come to Jesus when the har
1:10:19
when the Harvest has come they will remember that girl that guy who lived
1:10:25
