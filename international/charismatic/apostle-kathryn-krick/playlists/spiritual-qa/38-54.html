I have posted things on social media with new wine I don't want to be out of order can you share more on
0:07
this yes so kind of just the I guess like ground
0:14
Rules of Order when it comes to when you are planted somewhere and you have
0:20
respect for order you want to make sure you're being in line going in line with
0:25
the order and not like stepping outside the important thing to remember
0:31
is um to kind of have in your in your heart that God doesn't want you to
0:37
really like do your own thing but that you would be Kingdom Minded that you
0:43
would um just like have that kingdom of God mindset that you know it's rare to have
0:50
this kind of mindset in today's time with social media um people can just be starting their own
0:59
Ministries and maybe maybe they don't even see it as like this is my Ministry but really it it pretty much is because
1:04
it's become like a personal teaching platform and the danger in that
1:10
is that we are not all called to be teachers and God judges those who teach
1:15
um like more strictly like the Bible says you shouldn't desire to be a
1:21
teacher because it's more responsibility like in other words you have to really make sure
1:29
you are teaching really the right thing and you're really called to do this now when you are called to be a teacher when
1:35
you are called to be a minister when you when it's the season also to begin teaching to begin ministering um on
1:43
one's own platform or when invited to speak at one's church for
1:50
example then you should only have the fear of God you shouldn't be afraid you shouldn't be like oh no what if I don't
1:58
say the right thing you don't need to like live in fear like that but you should really have the fear of God like
2:04
take it really seriously so um but when you're not quite sure maybe if you're
2:12
called to be a teacher to be a minister in this season then it's better to air
2:17
on the side of caution like it's better to not jump ahead of the jump ahead of
2:24
the gun Jump Ahead whatever the say is um before it's time because that could
2:30
be that could be a little dangerous you know um when you're coming into the new
2:35
wine when you when your eyes have opened up to new wine and you've realized that
2:41
you had a lot of old religious Doctrine in you um from other places from other
2:47
teachings and you've been confounded yourself you should really humble yourself and realize there's still more
2:54
to go like there's still more to learn and there still might be stuff that I
2:59
don't realize this old wine old religious doctrine that God hasn't revealed yet there that my eyes haven't
3:05
opened up yet to see like this is wrong this is old um so therefore one wouldn't be it wouldn't
3:13
be the time yet to to teach right so
3:19
um basically for your social media platform for example the the safe thing to do the the
3:27
way you know you are you are in line and in order is to be sharing testimonies to
3:34
be sharing what God is doing the Miracles he's doing to be sharing your own personal testimonies and also
3:39
sharing others testimonies um and you can be sharing um
3:46
like teachings from where you're receiving from and you can
3:53
even it it depending on holy spirit's leading sometimes you can add Revelation
3:59
that you rece received from the teaching so but but like the meat of what is
4:05
being shared like the central part should be the teaching that you have heard rather than
4:12
something brand new being the core you know what I mean like like for
4:19
example if a word spoke to you in your current situation and opened up your
4:25
eyes in a new way sometimes when a teaching Goes Forth
4:30
God speaks more according to your situation God speaks more than those
4:36
word exact words um so that's what I mean so you could
4:41
share this teaching really open up my eyes and share where the teaching was from and who is teaching like where
4:48
you're planted um and and then share God opened up my eyes to this to this thing
4:56
I got this Revelation through this teaching then you know you're like staying in
5:02
line you're staying in order and you're not veering off and bringing something
5:08
new that um it's not time yet maybe and and also
5:14
just being sensitive like remember how I talk about
5:19
uh many people don't realize that like God wants you to receive for example the
5:24
word on Sunday and he wants that to marinate in you he wants that word to grow you he wants that word to really
5:31
change you and in order for that to take place you have to spend time with that
5:36
word you have to return to that word you have to meditate on that word so that being said we we can't really be
5:44
listening to too many teachings and definitely not too many teachers if we want that word to grow in
5:52
us right so it's being sensitive to that that we don't want to
5:57
like um overpopulate like the social media world
6:03
with with other words when God wants this word to go forth and and stick and
6:09
grow in people amen can I heal and free people
6:14
who do not yet believe but come to believe through a miracle from God okay
6:20
I think you mean like maybe they've witnessed a miracle or something and
6:25
they're not technically like they haven't confess that Jesus Christ is their lord and savior yet I think is
6:31
what you mean but they've seen a miracle and they're they're curious they're open
6:37
um I think that's what you mean so Jesus when he was ministering many times he was doing Miracles first he was healing
6:44
and delivering people and that's how people's Faith would would would arise
6:52
in them in Jesus that's how he was introducing himself to them like this is
6:58
who I am like I am the the Messiah I am the Son of God I am the savior of the
7:03
world I am the Lord and this is who I am this is why you should give your life to
7:09
me is because I'm full of love you can trust me um I love you so much I want to
7:16
heal you and deliver you so I'm going to not just talk about these things but actually show you like that is what
7:22
Jesus was doing when he was ministering he was introducing himself he wasn't just like speaking things and and then
7:29
doing Miracles once people believed his words but the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power he showed up
7:37
in his kingdom with his kingdom demonstrating his kingdom um so Jesus is moving the same
7:46
way today and so there's there will be many times where God heals a person and
7:53
that's how they come to believe like that's him showing his love to them so
7:59
there's nothing wrong with that that's actually one of the ways that God introduces himself to people it's rare
8:05
to hear about people coming to Jesus in that way today because Miracles are more rare the anointing is more rare but this
8:13
is what we see in the Bible and we're going to start seeing so much more of this now in this revival so um so yeah like I mean if
8:21
you're with someone and maybe they witness a miracle or something or or or
8:26
maybe if they just show some openness and Faith you can tell them about Jesus
8:31
like you can tell them God deliver me of this heal me of this um and and he did
8:37
this because he loves me and he actually loves you just as much as he loves me and he wants to do these things for you
8:43
too he wants to heal you and deliver you too um and if they're open if you are
8:48
noticing that they are open in words action their face then that is the
8:54
go-ahead to offer prayer for them like that's the go-ahead showing that they
9:00
have now become in your domain or your territory of where you can in the
9:06
spiritual realm legally execute your Authority like you can't just execute
9:11
your Authority in Christ and cast out demons and heal the sck anywhere it's it needs to be in proper order it needs to
9:18
be in your Authority and one of the places your Authority is is for example
9:23
if you're having this conversation with someone um like in a neutral space not
9:29
like inside of a church because inside of a church that's not your domain your territory it would be the leader of the
9:35
church's domain and territory and as they declare uh healing and deliverance over all God's people that's the time
9:42
that the person would receive their healing or Freedom so anyways back to the question so if that's your Authority
9:48
domain you can say I believe God wants to heal you right now do you want to do
9:53
you want can I would you like me to pray for you and believe that God will heal you right now so maybe they didn't even
9:59
confess that Jesus is their lord or savior yet but if they say yes and you can pray for them and then God may do a
10:06
miracle and then that may be what opens up their eyes that Jesus is Lord and
10:13
that they should they should uh they should say that g believe that Jesus is
10:18
their lord receive Jesus as their Lord but it's also important that like
10:24
if that's what's if that's the situation and you you prayed for them and they
10:30
received a miracle they're like wow Jesus and it's important you share with
10:36
them like you can give your life to Jesus right now and you can receive a
10:41
life of abundance you can receive eternal life you will go to heaven when you when you die you won't go to hell
10:49
and you can have a personal relationship with God right now and you can really have Abundant Life so all the other
10:55
things in your life that you're struggling with God wants to deliver you of those things too not just the one thing and that's what happens when you
11:01
give your life to Jesus there's an inheritance that comes when you give your life to Jesus and this is just like
11:06
a glimpse of it right now that little miracle you received is for foreshadowing a glimpse of what is to
11:13
come in your whole entire life and eternally if you give your life to Jesus so you could give your life to Jesus
11:19
right now you just tell him with your own words because he hears you right now just say Jesus I give you my life you
11:25
are my Lord I receive you as my Lord um just just basic basic the basic truth
11:31
the basic gospel like that and um just share with them the importance of
11:36
surrender and Abundant Life if they want to I mean that Miracle they just received it they could lose it if they
11:43
don't give their life to Jesus this is the reward and inheritance that comes
11:48
with surrendering your life to Jesus make sure they understand that rather than see it as magic or see it as um
11:57
just a a a gift that's theirs it's a gift that's theirs if they'll give their
12:02
life to Jesus otherwise it'll be taken away how do you discern if a good thing
12:07
is from God or a distraction so what God has made very
12:17
real to you in life like very spoken very clearly like this is your calling this is your
12:25
purpose this is where I want you this is what I want you to do
12:30
now for many of you the fullness of that has not been revealed yet but it should
12:38
be for about all of you you should know your purpose you should know the the
12:44
basic of your the basics of your purpose which i' I've shared before
12:49
but your purpose is to be a vessel of God in his fullness to be a vessel of
12:55
his power of His anointing so that when people meet you they encounter Jesus not
13:02
just in word but in power that you would really be the light of the world that
13:07
attracts people to Jesus that brings people to Jesus this is your calling this is my
13:14
calling and you have the same calling as me and it was revealed to me as time went by in my life more details of how I
13:23
would completely um to the fullness fulfill that purpose right for me
13:29
specifically to be an apostle to be a leader of fold church and everything but really the meat the core of the my
13:37
calling is is the same as yours is to be a vessel of Jesus to be really the
13:45
brightest light we can be and so you have to know that you you shouldn't be looking around you
13:51
shouldn't be looking around too much trying to find something find something you need to know like this is my purpose
14:00
and because you can get distracted otherwise you can be so focused on like career and everything that you lose
14:07
sight of really your true purpose the core of your purpose you know um and so
14:14
to fulfill your purpose to to be the brightest light you can be to be equipped to be a powerful vessel of God
14:21
and to receive anointing so you can be this vessel of God of his power you have
14:28
to do important things that are a big big big like biggest part of your life
14:35
you have to be trained spiritually you have to be planted where God's calling
14:40
you to be planted where his power is so that you can receive equipping regularly
14:47
so that you can grow to be this strong Victorious vessel of God Victorious over
14:56
the enemy so I mean going to church attending lives
15:03
like this and serving God serving God serving God at where you're at the
15:09
church um and and doing everything that God's calling you to do all of the
15:15
principles he's commanding you to do uh uh making your relationship with God
15:21
priority these things are what are the biggest things that contribute to you
15:26
fulfilling your purpose okay so you know that now you know like this
15:33
is the core this is the main thing the main thing in my life I remember when
15:40
once I received my calling um I mean once I really received
15:45
the calling that I was called to be an apostle and really it was just that I was really called to be truly a vessel
15:52
of God's power we can simplify it to make it more relatable to you like when
15:57
I received that calling upon my life when I receiv received the prophecy I remember that I had such Clarity like
16:05
never before every day I think before that I would wake up wondering am I doing the right thing I don't know if
16:11
I'm doing the right thing today like I don't I don't know if this is what I'm supposed to be doing you know I don't
16:16
know if this is really helping me fulfill my calling right now I remember at the time I was pursuing being a a
16:24
Christian musician and I just had that feeling of uncertainty every day and it was comfortable feeling cuz I just
16:29
wanted to be in God's Will and so when I received that calling it was the best feeling in the world it was the most
16:35
Clarity and direction I ever had it was like I just it's just like every literally my eyes just opened up every
16:41
day I was like I knew what to do I like I was like okay does
16:47
this does doing this activity
16:52
um what's the word help um help there's other words I'm trying
16:58
to think of but does this help my purpose go forth my calling like this
17:04
Vision that God's giving me is this cont contributing there we go contributing
17:09
does this contribute to my calling is this going to be helpful to my calling or is this
17:16
not really pushing it Forward pushing really my my my my the vision the assignment God's giving me
17:22
forward um that is like God opened my eyes to just like immediately to to H
17:29
how to how to have discernment of like how to spend my time each day um and it was life-changing and I
17:37
truly felt like wow I am I'm in God's will every day I felt
17:44
like this feels good I finally know I'm in God's will so the question was how do
17:49
you know if a good thing is a distraction from God or is like is good
17:55
is supposed to be that that's kind of the general en rule of thumb it's a
18:00
general rule of thumb if a good thing comes just you know ask yourself ask God
18:07
is this even though it's good is it helping push forth this Vision
18:13
contribute to this Vision assignment calling or is it taking away if you
18:19
start to notice that it's taking away it's taking away the time that you need to be devoted to your purpose then you
18:27
know that this is a distraction can you explain what again what the blessings of
18:33
God come without sorrow means yes there's a Bible verse that says the
18:38
blessings of God come without sorrow that means that blessing there
18:44
can be blessings from the enemy now blessings not really the best word to use it just to describe it as because
18:50
they aren't blessings but in the moment they can seem like blessings
18:57
because you okay if you are doing
19:02
witchcraft and the devil's like when you do this I'll give you this like money
19:09
because money is not a bad thing depending on the heart money can be a blessing from God absolutely lots of
19:16
money can be a blessing from God absolutely um but when the devil is blessing you with
19:24
is blessing you with money then it's not a good thing so there's a lot of people
19:31
like people are doing witchcraft whatever they are in it they are serving the devil because they want things they
19:38
want Power they want Supernatural Powers they're fascinated with having Supernatural Powers
19:44
maybe um they want money they want fame maybe um they want oh whatever all sorts
19:53
of things and so the devil will say serve me and then I will give you these
20:00
blessings that you want whether it's power whether it's money what Fame whatever um and the devil will really
20:07
give those things but they come with sorrow
20:13
meaning when you serve the enemy to get something there's
20:20
always demons that come along with that if you serve the enemy you will
20:25
have demons which means you will have oppression constant oppression so maybe
20:32
you have um maybe you have money but you have nightmares you have anxiety
20:40
depression and on the outside it looks like your life is great but really there was an exchange you received uh sorrow
20:49
with the blessings sorrow came with the blessing so that's on the side of like
20:54
being a witch but then it can be in every different okay it can be like three different
21:00
categories where this happens so we're talking the extreme of like being a witch someone wants Supernatural Powers
21:05
maybe and then they want other things like money and stuff and then um there's PE there's there's a neutral kind of
21:11
like people in the world people in the world that they want fame they want
21:19
money whatever they want other things um maybe that even they
21:25
want they want health or something like that I mean I remember one time a guy
21:30
came to our uh came to fful church when we were in the Park after having to dream and hearing
21:39
my voice but he didn't know was my voice saying get out in the order you entered him and after hearing that dream or the
21:47
voice in the dream he went looking for the voice and was looking for like Joyce Meyer and he realized it wasn't her cuz he knew it was like a woman preacher um
21:54
and then eventually he F like my video popped up on Tik Tok and he was like that's the voice and so he came to
22:01
Revival in the park at the time five full Church Revival in the park this is back in 2021 right after Revival broke out a couple months after Revival broke
22:07
out a few months after and when I called him forward to minister to him because
22:13
demons were manifested in him so much I called him forward and the demon started speaking out of him uh we he made either
22:22
he made a deal or we made a deal and and then God spoke to me in
22:27
that moment there was a demonic Covenant that he made with the
22:34
devil like um if I do this the devil will give me
22:40
this like an exchange a covenant um and it was that he his
22:47
um his relative I think it was his uncle just got in a car accident it was really
22:52
bad and it he was like on his deathbed and all of a sudden he was he didn't know what to do he didn't he was a Christ he was a Christian well lukewarm
22:59
but he didn't know about the power of God but he did hear about in rap songs deals with the devil so he like believed
23:06
that this was like a real thing if people were rapping about it and so he realized okay well I need a
23:11
supernatural solution right now and he like didn't really hear about the power
23:17
of God today so he literally in desperation went out on Hollywood Boulevard searching to make a deal with
23:23
the devil and of course the devil knew what he's up to so it wasn't easy for this to take place someone from sign
23:28
ology found him on the street and he he had this conversation with him and the guy from Scientology was like oh I can help you with this he brought him up he
23:35
had him sign a contract with blood and he says but wait before the contract he was like but um you need to give
23:41
something up for this and so what do you want to give up and he said that the man said my happiness he said are you sure
23:48
he said yeah so he signed it and then his happiness left from that moment he was miserable depressed his his um his
23:55
uncle still survived I mean his uncle survived D but his health was very bad ever since then and I think even
24:02
depression and stuff too like he just didn't live a good life so he received a supernatural healing
24:09
for his uncle from the devil but it came with sorrow it wasn't the pure
24:15
Supernatural healing that comes from God where it's where God can take you from sickness death to not just uh healed and
24:25
no more sickness but out of the def like out of the deficit and then Above So now
24:31
Abundant Health abundant energy that's what Jesus can do so that's blessings of
24:36
God without sorrow and even like Abundant Blessings beyond what we can imagine but the devil here he brought
24:42
blessing blessings with sorrow and also that came upon this man's this young
24:49
man's life that made the signed the contract his happiness left him but so
24:55
so he received the blessing that his uncle survived but it came with sorrow and but then when he so when we
25:04
were he at the park there I I I told him I said prophetically this is the key that unlocks your deliverance you need
25:10
to renounce that Covenant that you made so he renounced the Covenant the deal he made with the devil and God freed him in
25:17
that moment and then he came back testifying that he his happiness has returned and he has not felt this happy
25:23
since he was a fivey like a 5-year-old kid praise God Hal
25:28
Hallelujah um so that's an example of someone like
25:36
lukewarm or we can just say even like just someone in the world someone in the world wants to make a deal with the
25:43
devil um you see you see um you've seen weird things before I've
25:50
seen weird things before like certain singers tons of people die at the concert and it doesn't even make sense
25:56
like how that could happen um there are people who they make deals
26:02
with the devil to get money to get Fame and then the devil makes them pay for that the devil makes them make
26:09
sacrifices even like blood sacrifices like that people would die you know for
26:14
them to receive that so that's blessings getting the money and fame and
26:19
everything in their career um with sorrow and of course when that person
26:25
has to make those sacrifices not just is that the the pain of you know being
26:33
responsible for people's death but they're definitely getting lots of demons they're definitely having
26:38
depression anxiety I mean and they also don't have Jesus so there's no Abundant Life without Jesus and the more you go
26:46
into the devil's Kingdom like the more you're seeking the devil for help for blessings the more oppression you'll
26:52
have okay so we have the category of like witches warlocks blessings with sorrow that come
26:59
we have the category of um like neutral just people in the world that aren't
27:05
really aren't trying to be witches but um you know they're maybe
27:11
they don't even realize that they're making deals with the devil but maybe they're say saying it to the universe or something you know maybe they're just
27:17
saying like I will do anything to have this and I will make sacrifices whatever
27:23
but I must have this what you know whatever they're saying with their words can even be this Covenant contract with
27:30
the devil um and then you have this you have even the
27:37
third category of Christians or Christians
27:44
who um unfortunately out of jealousy and selfish
27:50
ambition want to have have huge Ministries
27:58
have Fame have lots of followers all of
28:06
this and um like what happens is with jealousy it's
28:12
a per like a person you see like Saul with David like David was anointed by
28:18
God Saul was an anointed servant of God so they were like on the same team Saul
28:23
wasn't just some random person in the world he's jealous of this man of god of the anointing on his life and the favor
28:31
among God and people on David's life so he's jealous he wants that he wants specifically that he's not looking for
28:38
worldly pleasures and success he wants that so he wants David to go down um and
28:47
that's exactly what the devil wants so the devil will use those opportunities
28:52
he will use PE like present day Sauls who are jealous who want want what the
28:58
David has and um you know the devil will plant ideas in their minds and they'll
29:04
just grab it the devil will plant jealousy in their minds and they'll just accept it and and it will become them
29:10
they will become jealous people the devil will plant ideas in their heads in their minds um Wicked ideas of how to um
29:20
push down the David of today and get ahead and and um even yeah
29:28
just Wicked demonic strategies the devil will put in the
29:35
person will accept and you know people I've I've seen this happen I've
29:41
seen like present day saws make up lies about complete lies complete false
29:46
accusations about present day Davids um literally as a way to actually push down
29:52
the David of today and literally make themselves rise up um like use them
29:58
talking bad about David of today uh to get attention and like to get Fame out
30:06
of out of that out of making up these lies and
30:11
creating such a news media circus or whatever that that they build even
30:19
followers from doing that and that is literally the devil's strategy he's
30:26
giving them they're accepting it and they're doing it and it's working I mean
30:32
like they're literally getting followers not from God though so all of their
30:38
stuff can be completely preaching about Jesus then they throw in some or a lot
30:43
of um speaking against Servants of God maybe it's even just a little bit but um
30:50
just that action made literally followers to come and uh
30:57
money to come and what have you these blessings to come literally from the
31:05
enemy yes this this can absolutely happen so um these
31:11
blessings from the en blessings from the enemy they come with sorrow they come
31:16
with sorrow um it it it it's not pure you know for like like for one
31:26
um if they are preaching badly about a person people
31:34
with good fruits in in themselves people with good Hearts pure hearts will
31:40
see that for what it is and will not be attracted they won't see Jesus in them
31:46
so they won't be attracted there but people with not good fruits with not
31:52
good hearts with people there are people out there who like have jealousy in
31:57
their hearts and like want people to be torn down like people of God to be torn
32:03
down just simply because of of jealousy you know maybe in their life things aren't going great and they
32:10
just see like God blessing someone success Godly success and favor upon
32:16
someone and they can be jealous of that person just ordinary people not people even who have platforms and so if
32:22
someone has a platform and they're like speaking against this person and pushing them down the people with those same
32:30
like bad hearts are like yes finally I'm so happy I'm so happy that um this
32:39
person's being beaten down I was so jealous of them like people can have those kind of hearts and those those are
32:44
the people that are attracted to those types of
32:51
ministers and so um their following is a bunch of like
32:57
not good Hearts you know um so the those blessings are going to come with sorrow
33:03
and um not just that but when you're opening up the door to the enemy like
33:08
that it's coming with oppression absolutely and
33:15
also you you can't touch the anointed the Bible says do not touch the anointed that there's a reaping that comes with
33:21
doing that and so um maybe at first when God's giving a person time to repent
33:28
it's not seen it seems like there's no repercussions even it looks like they're
33:35
being rewarded rewarded by the devil that's where the followings come coming from uh and success is coming from but
33:42
there will come a time if they will if they do not repent where the the the
33:50
grace Time of repentance is is over and the reaping Begins the sorrow really
33:57
kicks in the blessings of the enemy with sorrow really kicks in that's why it's so important by the
34:04
way that's why you know with this Insight that I shared about things that can happen present day SS of today
34:09
that's why it's very important that the body of Christ is looking at fruits that's why it's very important you don't
34:16
listen to just whatever teaching shows up on like your YouTube channel or something whatever teacher you need to
34:23
make sure the fruits are there because you are going to be receiving from that fruit so if
34:30
it's bad fruits there's jealousy in one's heart you know religion selfish
34:37
motives you're receiving from that fruit you're eating from that tree so that's another big reason I always talk about
34:43
the importance of being planted that's another big reason you
34:49
it's you don't want to accidentally eat the wrong fruit you know when God has
34:56
shown you this is where I'm called to be planted this is good fruit this is pure fruit you can rest and Trust
35:02
here just rest and receive don't mess around on these streets
35:08
of other weird things going on with other other people in in their hearts
35:15
you know make sure you get to know the heart before you receive commit to
35:21
receiving under your ministry there is an abundance of teaching I'm wondering how to prioritize what to listen to and
35:26
relist to when it genuinely seems like every teaching well first of all um I have
35:33
that Revival army training playlist that's on my YouTube channel um and I
35:38
need I'm going to be adding more there's definitely more just because I haven't added recent ones doesn't mean that a
35:43
lot of recent ones I haven't added yet okay so just keep that in mind so I need to update it um I'll be updating it
35:50
regularly but those are the ones I selected there are like really like it I
35:56
selected them on God led me to select those on purpose those ones that I put on that playlist um they're just very one
36:05
they're they're teachings that you should really know and have in you and even be able to teach like it should be
36:10
such a big part of you and a lot of these well pretty much all of them are new wine and so they can't be listened
36:18
to to Ju Just One time they probably contradict a lot of old wine maybe you've maybe a certain teaching on
36:25
something maybe it was um like how like um uh like how to pray
36:31
for people there's a teaching that's coming to mind right now about your territory your domain I was talking
36:37
about that a little bit earlier in this in this live right now um but like praying for people and ministering to
36:44
people um you might have heard or seen the example of so much old
36:51
wine Doctrine when it comes to this topic in your life maybe for many many many many years and so just listening to
36:59
it one time the new wine is not going to really get rid of
37:04
all the old wine in you overnight old wine skin in you overnight
37:11
um get that in you so that God continues to open up your eyes more and more so you fully understand it so it goes from
37:17
just like receiving it like oh okay this is new okay amen so it goes from that to
37:23
God open in your eyes so you grasp it you understand it you you really get it
37:29
because when that happens that's when the old mind's able to really come out that's when you're able to have this revelation of like oh like this is
37:37
wrong and this is right you know like you because at first it could be
37:43
conflicting like but I I don't understand why this is wrong I don't understand like this makes sense to me
37:49
though and this isn't you know what I mean um you know
37:55
like like for example uh like I really by the grace of God I
38:01
really grasp and understand the spiritual laws spiritual
38:07
laws and like what makes demons go and
38:12
how it's when we execute our Authority but it has to be the proper domain it can't just be executing your Authority
38:19
Any Which Way but just like how I understand the president had his has his
38:25
domain and when he said says everyone in America must do this then everyone in America will do this but if he says
38:31
everyone in France must do this no one in France will do this and people in America will even lose respect for him
38:38
or her the president um whoever the president is or in the future um because
38:44
it it's showing that the person doesn't even understand laws of
38:50
authority have they are they incapable are they incapable of being the
38:55
president if they're like going and saying people in France need to do this and do you know you know what
39:00
I'm trying to say so like that for me like I understand that now I grasp that
39:07
now so like I can teach on that now I can I can
39:14
really teach with passion and confidence and boldness I'm Not Afraid about what people I'm Not Afraid about people being
39:20
offended because most people the old wineskin way is like like out of church
39:25
service for example for tons of people to be praying for one another at the same time but that simply just goes
39:31
against the rules of the spiritual laws the the the laws of authority and simply
39:39
because of that it makes demons to be just like how um we in America would be
39:45
if the president starts saying France needs to do all these things and neglecting us it would be like we lose
39:50
respect you know what I mean and so demons lose respect when we do the this
39:57
old wine way of like everybody trying to cast out demons at one time rather than the new wine way the Apostle Peter way
40:06
everyone come under the shadow Peter's going to execute his authority because this is his domain and every demon in
40:11
this place must obey and it's simple and it's with order and it's without chaos
40:17
and we don't have random people with with W with witchcraft in them and demonic spirits laying hands on people
40:24
with demons and imparting demons upon people we don't know you know we don't have that going on we have order and
40:30
people are safe and demons have to obey because the authority of Christ is being
40:36
executed properly the right way you know so
40:42
um it's that's just an example I'm giving you right now so like for example
40:47
that new wine God wants that to get in you how it got into me like like
40:53
Revelation to really seep in you so so you understand it so you really get
41:00
it so you can so you can be a teacher yourself I mean I don't mean like if
41:06
you're I don't mean you're to go minister in front of tons of people but I mean just like sharing with someone if
41:11
they don't understand if they're like yeah I visited um fivefold church for example and like how come like it's it's
41:18
not like other churches I've been to in terms of like praying for people like the praying for people was like different like I don't really get that
41:23
you know you can like confidently B share with them rather than
41:30
like be well yeah feel timid and unsure and you kind of get it but you know what
41:37
you know what I'm trying to say so that's why I say this is Revival army training because God is building up his
41:43
army to be like the Disciples of Jesus like when the Disciples of Jesus came to
41:48
G were came first to be disciples they didn't know anything at first um and
41:54
then as they spent time with Jesus they learned they were equipped they grew and then we see Apostle Peter Apostle Paul
42:01
we see all the disciples doing what Jesus did and teaching and they're able
42:07
to do that and so God doesn't want you to be just a a churchgoer he wants you to
42:14
be a dis a true disciple that can make disciples that can do these things as
42:21
well um he wants you to to be so powerful in the king om to really be
42:27
this Mighty Revival Army Warrior Hallelujah that's what he wants
42:34
for you so that's why I say um you can really make sure that those messages get in you because you'll know that they're
42:41
really like foundational yeah so make sure you really get those messages in you you
42:46
allow God to speak to you more and more cuz that's what happens when you listen to teachings again and again it's the
42:53
word of God coming forth yeah get those teaches into you because as you read the word of God God speaks to you something
42:59
new he speaks to you that's why when we read the word of God for years and years God still speaks new things to us so
43:06
that's what will happen through the the spoken word of God too and then um like if you're planted
43:14
at fful church and I mean this is just a general answer for anyone wherever you're planted like understand that the teaching you're
43:21
receiving on Sunday that teaching is is so important for you it's not just another teaching like that's it's it's
43:28
important it's the word of God coming forth for you so really value it um and and the teaching that comes forth like
43:35
in the middle of the week when when I have midweek teachings on the lives that's also really important for you it's prophetic so really just value them
43:44
all and allow Holy Spirit to lead you um what to return to you can't go wrong
43:51
with like the moral of the story is how to prioritize teachings you you can't go
43:56
really wrong when you're like being planted and you're you're talking about where you were planted those
44:03
teachings just as long as you're making sure you're get really getting that that playlist that I shared on my YouTube in
44:11
you oh yes and I also have um Chanel just said even the podcast episodes released are prophetic yeah so I have a
44:18
podcast too and we're purposely putting out teachings a lot of them are from the past and some of them might be ones you
44:23
haven't heard before maybe you came later on um they're teach in some of them are from 2021 um so those are prophetic too
44:31
absolutely those are going to be released like older ones but God knows you need to hear in that
44:37
moment amen how do you not let in darkness when you're constantly working in
44:44
darkness and is there a better way to maintain your Purity hold on I just lost it maintain
44:51
your Purity then constantly trying to empty that Darkness out for light
44:58
all right so the thing is is that we are called to be in the world and not of the
45:05
world but we are called to be in the world so we don't need to feel like we are unsafe living in this world part of
45:12
that is going to be working in jobs that's in the world and a big part of
45:17
the way that we reach the lost and Shine the Light to the darkness is being amidst the darkness so that they can see
45:24
the light so it's not too far away for them to to see it we got to be there to
45:29
shine it amen so I mean it pretty much in most per
45:35
most people's lives God will have you in at least a season of being of of working
45:41
in the world and for most people they will be working in the world not
45:47
everyone is called to full-time Ministry so um first of all I just want
45:52
to say that's you don't need to be afraid of it you don't need to be concerned about about it this is normal
45:57
this is what God wants and so therefore God will help you protect you be with
46:03
you keep you um just know that first of all don't be like afraid of being around
46:11
darkness when it comes to the world I mean working in the world now obviously
46:17
we shouldn't go chasing it like we shouldn't go to clubs we shouldn't go hanging out with the wrong people we're
46:23
not protected in those areas cuz God's not calling you to that but God be calling you to work in a job that's
46:29
around people of the world absolutely and in those cases you're safe you're protected God even wants you there to
46:36
plant seeds to Shine the Light to to help lead them into the kingdom lead them to him so remember that first of
46:43
all remember like this is your assignment this is your assignment I remember this job that I had um before I
46:51
was full-time Ministry I had already received my calling to be an apostle I had already started to fful church it was a different name at the time and um
46:59
for a good I think 9ish months or so or 10 months or
47:04
something like nine Nish months probably eight nine months I was um it might have
47:10
been actually nine months anyways there's a lot of nine month seasons that happen I think this actually might have been nine months if I think about it but
47:17
anyways um there's about nine months of when I was nannying while ministering
47:23
and I was nannying in um a person of the world's home and um she and uh was
47:31
actually Jewish and her son actually gave his life to Jesus in the car with
47:37
me after I actually prayed for him when he had pain and the pain left him in his
47:42
mouth and his his eyes were so shocked and I was like that's Jesus so that's actually how he was introduced to Jesus
47:47
going back to what I was sharing about earlier actually in this in this live about sometimes that's how God
47:53
introduces himself as the miracle um um and then it was so precious we would talk about God in the car um that was
48:01
like me being trained by God even to to disciple others you know um but I
48:11
remember that the mother it would would speak very negatively and sometimes she
48:17
would just want to to talk when I just like wanted to leave you know because it was lot a lot of like negative things
48:24
being said um more things of darkness and actually it was in the time of political like oh
48:31
was time of election and so it was very much like the world's going to end and like doom doom doom like this is awful
48:38
just and it was just like so much Darkness coming out and I was kind of
48:45
forced to listen for a little bit of but still like still maintaining boundaries
48:51
but I had to be like polite to the boss you know so I I just share that to share
48:56
with you that like I was going through that even um while ministering and God
49:01
protected me and it's just part of it and it's not fun it's uncomfortable but there's something that you need to realize it doesn't have to affect you
49:08
you don't have to be worried like this person spewing all this darkness and
49:13
this is coming inside of me now like when you if you're watching a movie with
49:20
Darkness or if you are choosing to hang out with a person who's speaking so much
49:26
Darkness you're choosing to do that when God's saying no then there's not a Grace of protection over you in those areas
49:33
you're opening up a door for Darkness to come in you but when you are for example working at a job where there's no choice
49:41
like the person there is talking a bunch of dark things and there's no choice like you you have to be there it's it's
49:48
the job right there is a Grace of protection over you you still have to do
49:53
spiritual work though but I want to say first of all you need to understand there's a Grace over you there's protection over you so it's important
49:59
you're not treating it like um you hanging out with the wrong people watching a dark movie like oh I'm
50:06
opening the door while doing this yes you are you should have fear of that like fear of God like don't do that but
50:12
when you're when you're in the workplace it's not the same so don't feel guilty
50:17
don't feel afraid like oh no darkness is coming in me now like rest rest God
50:23
wants you there to be the light and there's this special Grace and protection over you now for this
50:30
assignment so rest relax don't let it worry you the darkness is coming in
50:35
number one number two you do need to do spiritual work no if you're exposed to
50:41
Darkness like in the workplace you do need to make sure you're making the attention to do the spiritual work that
50:48
God calls us to do like renew your mind uh like reject every every negative
50:55
words spoken or negative thought so if a person is saying dark things if a person
51:00
is saying negative things to you maybe they're just like saying um speaking against you and they're not
51:08
even trying to be mean or maybe they are but maybe someone's just saying like yeah I don't I don't think you'll
51:15
make it in this or something like that you should probably should do this instead I think you should you should probably do this instead I don't think
51:20
this will work out for you or something maybe they they trying to be helpful or something give you advice but you know God called you to do this hard thing or
51:27
something um then reject that for example uh and then after you are have
51:34
have left that place of Darkness remember like you're safe you're protected but also make this intention
51:41
to do the spiritual work renewing your mind taking thoughts captive and spending time with Jesus and filling
51:48
yourself with light like um you always need to be doing these things you always need to prioritize your relationship
51:53
with God spending time with him being in the word um worshiping him um listening
51:59
to the word listening like like right now listening to the word you need to always be fing yourself with these
52:04
things but if you're in a super dark Works Space then it's definitely the
52:10
season where you need to drench yourself even more even more make that intention to drench yourself even more with a
52:16
light and fill yourself um just because it's a particularly dark place you're
52:22
working all right but um above all rest
52:27
and don't worry because just don't let that Spirit of religion come in you in that way of like
52:36
um like by that I mean it's like Spirit of religion many times comes in different ways right but one part of the
52:42
spirit religion is forgetting God's grace that part of the spirit religion Spirit of religion is what I'm talking
52:48
about don't forget about God's grace if God's calling you somewhere to be somewhere his grace is there you don't
52:55
need to worry otherwise you can be unintentionally filled with fear
53:00
depression being down that you have to work at this place and stuff you can be
53:06
down for no reason like simply because you're listening to the spirit of religion and not
53:12
Grace if a Christian friend from my previous Church speaks negatively about you should I cut ties as she has been
53:19
like a spiritual sister for example praying with me Exedra in the past you know Abram was called to leave
53:27
his land when God was giving him a new name and placing him in the land where
53:33
he would fulfill his purpose so that's the same for us today and many times
53:38
what that's going to look like is God's calling you to the new wine he's calling you to the promised land
53:44
he's calling you to be used powerfully by him and there's going to be people alongside of you that will be Iron
53:50
sharpening iron with you that will be family in the body of Christ they're going to they're going to be alongside
53:57
of you and be your family and even help you by Iron sharpening iron to really
54:03
fulfill what God has called you to do you can't bring people from Abram land that are
54:11
stuck in old wine that can't receive the new wine with you if you want to go
54:16
where God has called you to it won't work it'll be pulling you back and this is quite simple because for example and
54:23
this is not just this is not just about me I'm talking just in general I'm talking let this be a general teaching for everyone when it comes to the new
54:30
wine and where God is calling you to be planted if God is calling be you to be planted somewhere to have a spiritual
54:36
father or mother and they are in the new wine okay so they believe in the power of God they believe in the fful ministry
54:43
they believe in miracles and healing and deliverance and the casting out of demons and they are coming to destroy
54:51
religion you know this is like the new wine I'm summarizing the new wine okay
54:57
um so for every servant of God out there that spiritual father and mother out
55:02
there if where God is calling you to be planted under them there will be people that don't get
55:11
it that don't that are like how the Pharisees were like they were stuck in
55:16
the old wine they just won't get it their eyes just won't open up or at least in this season they will not open
55:22
up and that's just how it is and we just have to accept that and we have to realize that
55:29
it's not doing us any good to bring Abram land with us we can't God called
55:34
Abram to leave the old land and leave the old people behind they were there for a season they were good in a season
55:41
but they can't help you get to where God has called you to go they will pull you back and this is this is very simple to
55:47
understand for example like if you if God has called you to fly in his new wine you know to be remember how I was
55:54
just talking about like like how God wants you to receive the new wine and get it in you and like you are bold and
56:02
strong and confident in this and you're just able to fly with him right like me I'm able to go up there and Minister and
56:08
not be afraid about offending people and I don't have to like have that in the back of my mind when I'm preaching I
56:13
don't have to be like okay I'm going to say this now and um there'll probably be
56:20
exposed videos made up about me when I say this and um I wonder how people will take take this probably even people who
56:26
are listening to this now in the congregation they probably won't get this and what will they think and will
56:33
they leave after they say that like I don't by the grace of God that's not
56:38
going in my mind when I'm preaching when I'm preaching difficult things when I'm preaching new wine things that is new
56:45
that is new to the body of Christ not new according to the Bible new to what we've seen today by the grace of God
56:51
that's not in me so I can be a pure vessel of God without like fear of man
56:58
and selfish motivation and insecurity like like intertwined with the anointing no I can
57:06
be a pure vessel of the anointing so God can do everything he wants to do and the word of God can come forth without
57:12
timidity but with boldness with Purity and boldness and passion and when I can
57:20
deliver the word of God like that then the people can really grab it and eyes
57:25
can open up but if I'm preaching with this weird mixture they're not going to be able to grab it the same way right so
57:32
it's very important for me you know like go it's important to God that I'm a pure vessel so that the people can really
57:38
receive this and can be equipped and be strong right so that's just an example for me I can't be held back so in the
57:45
same way God doesn't want you to be held back he doesn't want you to be halfway in halfway out halfway in the new wine
57:52
but holding on to Abram land at the same time time pulling the friends with the old win skin that won't leave their old
57:58
wines skin pulling them along with you you won't be the most powerful vessel of God you can be you will not be you you
58:05
won't be so walk in that wisdom and understand like it's okay to let go of
58:12
Abraham Abram friends I mean just in terms of bringing them close we still love everyone we still love everyone
58:18
from our past but new boundaries need to be made in different seasons according to how God's leading you and it's making
58:25
room for the right people to come alongside you God can't entrust you with the right good people in the Abraham
58:32
land if you're still hanging on to Abram land people he can't entrust because
58:39
then you're going to hold them back you know people that are fully surrendered in Abraham land people that are fully
58:45
surrendered in the new wine he can't entrust them to you to be
58:51
a friend to you if you aren't all in because you will pull them back you see
59:00
so it's missing out on what God has for you on fulfilling your purpose if if you
59:07
if you hang on to Abram land hang on to old wine old win skin
59:13
even if you're like nope I'm done with old wines skin but I want to hold on to my friend from the old win skin it's the same thing is keeping old wine skin
59:21
technically I shared the prophetic word of that it was now time for the older
59:27
generation leaders in the body of Christ to pass the Baton to the new generation
59:35
whom God has raised up in the new wine in this new move that God is doing it's time to really pass that baton
59:42
so it's a season we're in right now where it's time to
59:49
be bold and unashamed about what God is doing and his
59:56
leaders you know it's it's it's time to be bold and unashamed it's time to be
1:00:01
uncompromising right and so if there's someone who is just not agreeing with
1:00:09
God's new move and his new leaders like if you're wondering how to put
1:00:15
boundaries up it's okay to say I know in my heart God has called me here I know
1:00:21
this is his move I know this is his true servant that he's called me to be
1:00:26
planted under and receive from I know with all my heart so um it's important
1:00:31
for me to be obedient to God to to obey him and be planted here and
1:00:38
so um if someone's talking bad for example say this isn't good for my
1:00:44
spiritual health because this really is where God's called me to be
1:00:50
so I I can't like really re be hearing or receiving the bad words being spoken
1:00:56
about what God's doing you know it's time now to be bold and unashamed and
1:01:02
stand up for God right standing up for God includes standing up for his move his works his Min his true Ministries
1:01:08
his true servants how to know if a person is draining you spiritually well I've
1:01:14
shared before the importance of putting up healthy boundaries and only bringing
1:01:19
in close to you in your life Those whom God has called you to bring in close um um and anyone he hasn't called you to
1:01:26
bring in close to put boundaries and so bringing in close just means I mean it means for one spending
1:01:33
time spending time like listening to and talking
1:01:39
to that's a big meaning of bringing in close so if you're bringing in so maybe
1:01:46
you're you're trying to decide right now what boundaries you need to be put up what which ones are who are the people
1:01:52
God's calling you to really bring in close and who are supposed to not be close you're trying to decide that right
1:01:57
now maybe okay so maybe you're finding someone's draining now that would be a
1:02:04
indicator that they're not called to be brought in close to you now there can be
1:02:10
a time where maybe someone God calls you to pour in just in
1:02:15
terms of like a mentorship type thing a type situation maybe for that purpose of just
1:02:25
pouring into them not so much like friendship but knowing this is my
1:02:32
assignment this is my purpose right now is to just pour into them but when that's the case you have to know
1:02:38
that that's like a one-time thing or maybe it will be a couple time thing or
1:02:43
however God leads and so if if it's a time to like pour in some to someone
1:02:50
then maybe you'll feel a little drained and that's okay like maybe the person's venting a lot and speaking a lot of
1:02:56
negative things but God's calling you to speak life to them and pour into them and maybe that feels like a lot
1:03:02
afterwards like that's okay in those circumstances but I want to speak specifically to like friends like if you
1:03:09
have some friends and you're trying to decide which ones does God want me to
1:03:14
bring in close and which ones do I need to not have close so when one is
1:03:19
draining that's that that's when you can see that's a person that God has want me to bring it really close so what how
1:03:27
will you know if they're draining um pretty simple
1:03:32
like if a this is how a friend should be they should be spiritually mature and
1:03:39
that means they should be speaking life and light they should not be speaking death
1:03:44
and darkness um they should have faith in God they should they should not have
1:03:51
they should not allow their circumstances to be bigger than God so when they're talking and when they're
1:03:56
speaking and having discussions with you whatever it should not be Doom and Gloom and worry and
1:04:04
fear but the the conversation should be that of Hope and Faith and even when
1:04:12
we're going through hard things and they're sharing about something hard they're going through that there's acknowledgement of faith in God
1:04:20
you know and hope oh there can be moments of weakness
1:04:26
sometimes that's okay I'm not saying people have to be so perfect I don't mean that but like overall that they are
1:04:33
people of faith that they are spiritually mature they should also respect you as a
1:04:39
person which means respecting your time um
1:04:45
so a person shouldn't just be like talking to you for 3 hours or 2
1:04:52
hours when and you have a life you have things that God's calling you to
1:04:58
do sometimes people want to talk just to talk it feels good to talk um and maybe
1:05:04
that's how they show love and that's how they know to show love so it doesn't mean it's like a bad motive or anything
1:05:10
but I mean and I'm saying this for all of you here it's important for you to know maybe if you're a big talker and stuff be spiritually mature in this area
1:05:18
to know that there's a certain amount of hours in the day and to be really respectful of people's time
1:05:24
and to to be respectful if they have things to do if they need to work on things it's not the time to
1:05:31
like uh um intersect yourself there and like take over what they're doing be if
1:05:37
you really want to talk to them about something um ask if they have time or you know just and then as you're talking
1:05:44
to them be aware of the time be aware of how much you're talking um just be respectful just be respectful and just
1:05:51
know like you could be draining to someone when maybe their day really busy
1:05:56
and they have a lot they're trying to do for God and they don't have the capacity to listen to you for a couple hours or
1:06:02
so just talk about not important things or something like that you know what I mean like and
1:06:08
also um be intentional with with your conversations like um let your
1:06:15
conversations bring life let your conversations come with purpose I mean of course we can talk
1:06:21
about you know just normal everyday things it doesn't have to be like wildly
1:06:28
spiritual and with all of this purpose but like overall let's live our lives
1:06:34
with purpose let's live our relationships with purpose let's not waste time let's not become a
1:06:41
distraction with how we're talking and conversations so if you're seeing this on the other side happening to you where
1:06:47
a person's not really being really being respectful of your time um maybe you can
1:06:53
tell like they just just really want to talk I mean this is a big thing for a lot of people they they just want to
1:06:58
talk like it makes them feel loved it makes them feel seen it makes them feel
1:07:04
like accepted and it's how they process things um so it's not like it's a bad
1:07:09
thing but we have to be respectful so of people's time you know so if you're
1:07:14
seeing if someone's just not not being respectful um that could be that's an indicator too now you can have
1:07:21
conversations with them too like you know maybe they're not aware maybe they're not aware of how much work you
1:07:28
have to do or how much work for God you have to do and how they're becoming draining unintentionally maybe they're
1:07:34
not aware so you can with love and with kindness share with them so I have all this work to do so I don't have too much
1:07:40
time you know today or maybe this week or maybe every day just be upfront with them in a loving way and if they're
1:07:46
respectful and understand then that shows that you don't maybe you don't necessarily need to put up the
1:07:53
boundaries like you thought you were going to have to um at the end of the day just are they being respectful or
1:08:00
are they um bringing distraction or draining
1:08:05
you I am at my local church in Omaha Nebraska but I have been growing through 5f church so can I be
1:08:12
planted at 5f church yeah so it's going to be different for everybody like there will be some people who God will call
1:08:19
them to be planted at fivefold church and God will say you know I just want you to watch online you know you don't
1:08:25
need anything else I just want you to be focused here and and they will do that and that's amazing and that's there
1:08:31
you're not missing anything but then there will be others that maybe God will call you to be a light in the local
1:08:38
church you're in and um you know still stay there if you don't live in the city
1:08:44
of La for example um but but you're but you are planted at fold church but you
1:08:50
are still going to another local church like that's okay too it's going to be different from everyone above all Just
1:08:56
Surrender everything to God and then those convictions will come okay so so
1:09:02
just be respectful of everyone everyone's in a different season has a different um thing God is speaking for
1:09:09
the season amen so don't think like you're weird or something or you're missing something if God is speaking to
1:09:15
you something okay you will find both situations but the important thing to
1:09:21
know is like where God is calling you to be planted it's important you recognize this is where I'm called to be planted
1:09:26
this is where really I'm receiving my equipping the teaching this is where I will be equipped to fulfill my purpose
1:09:32
this is where I'm receiving impartation of anointing and this is also where God's calling me to serve and uh and
1:09:38
sell so it's important you re you understand that like we're not called to be planted in multiple places so
1:09:43
acknowledge where you're called to be planted and make sure you're not neglecting any of the parts of being
1:09:49
planted any of the principles important principles of being planted um and then know that if you are still
1:09:57
if you're attending a church in your city understand your assignment there to
1:10:03
be the light understand like there's a reason why you're planted somewhere else and not there right the reason is is
1:10:09
maybe there's there's new wine there you're really growing there like you weren't growing over there over here at the church you're attending a person
1:10:15
you're receiving Deliverance you know you're you're seeing more Abundant Life come to you so you're finding more Jesus
1:10:21
over here probably is I mean where you're called to be planted that's probably the reason for for many why
1:10:27
they're planting themselves at a church that's not in their city rather than the one in their city so um that being said
1:10:35
have have a heart for those that those who haven't received
1:10:41
yet share testimonies with them you don't have to um like go against order
1:10:48
in that church and like um you know like be on on this mission
1:10:54
to convert everyone to go to another church online and stuff like that I don't mean that but
1:11:00
just peacefully and honestly share testimony with those whom God calls you
1:11:06
to like those who you're friends with those where the conversations come up you know maybe they noticed something
1:11:12
different about you maybe they noticed like you're just talking and you're like yeah my life's been different recently I
1:11:18
used to struggle with this but I don't anymore and this is how it happened um maybe they're sharing that they
1:11:23
struggling with something and you're like you know what God can free you this is how I know I've experienced it I've
1:11:29
exper I received Deliverance here you can receive it too watching online you know things like that so um just be on
1:11:40
assignment be on Mission be on purpose uh peacefully and still going in order
1:11:46
and like being respectful to um like that church you know but just showing
1:11:51
the the love of God like I want want to see people be free I simply just want to see people be free not coming with the
1:11:58
the intention of like I want to bring people to another church no but having the heart of I want to see people be
1:12:04
free and people are if people are missing things if people are missing Revelation they're missing new wine they're missing Deliverance I just
1:12:11
honestly want to share it with them that Jesus can do it for them I want to declare over all of you right
1:12:17
now may this anointing increase in your life and may you inrease in wisdom for
1:12:24
all of the decisions you need to make for all of the things you've had uncertainty about let Clarity come from
1:12:32
now may the words spoken today release to you be implanted in you and grow in
1:12:38
you and be a part of you and may in turn the wisdom and discernment grow in you
1:12:43
may your spiritual ears open up more to hear God's voice and so may you walk in Clarity not in confusion but in Clarity
1:12:53
