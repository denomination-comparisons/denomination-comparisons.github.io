what should we do when we read the word but don't understand something you need the Holy Spirit to
0:06
read the word to get Revelation from the word but the thing is the thing that's
0:12
important to understand is that it's not as simple as Just Having the Holy Spirit day one you receive the Holy Spirit when
0:18
you give your life to Jesus and all of a sudden the Bible's just completely easy to read makes perfect
0:25
sense every single word it won't be like that what will happen is as the Bible says when you seek the Lord with all
0:32
your heart then you'll find him and so similarly to like how your revelation of
0:38
God and his kingdom and his love it's been a journey you know it's not like you received it all on day one the
0:46
Revelation even I know for me and so many of you had no clue about one of the
0:51
most important parts of Jesus in his kingdom which is his power the the anointing I know like so
0:59
many of us so many of you and me included that was not even in our vocabulary till um later on in life the
1:06
anointing the power of God but the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power it's literally Central it's
1:12
it's such an important part it it's the main part of the kingdom of God is his
1:18
anointing his power um but so many of us we were Christian for many years and and and it took a while to discover that so
1:25
in the same way that's how it is with every aspect of the Kingdom revelation revelation of the word don't feel like
1:33
pressure or discouragement if there are some things you don't understand in the word the important thing is to be
1:39
teachable because that's the principle uh in the kingdom of God that when
1:45
you're teachable you'll God will open your eyes that's that's a principle when you're teachable when you're humble then
1:52
God will open your eyes then you will receive Revelation then you will understand so if you read the word and
2:00
you're trying to be forceful with understanding something maybe that even includes searching on YouTube for all
2:07
different teaching on a certain topic like maybe you're trying to be forceful to understand something that's not
2:12
really quite being um teachable because maybe it's just not that God it's not God's time to reveal it in depth yet not
2:19
that God doesn't want you to know it but what's what's important to understand is that
2:25
um we can't learn everything at one time just like a school like just like school school there's it takes 13 years to get
2:33
a diploma um you know from high school and then college is four years and then
2:40
to be a lawyer is many more years to be a doctor is many more years to get your doctorate is many more years so in the
2:47
same way learning the things of the Kingdom learning all of the revelations like God's true Revelation from his word
2:54
like the true meaning of his word that cannot happen like the first time you read the Bible through like if you read
3:00
the Bible front to back you cannot receive everything that first time you read it um and also then you would never
3:06
need to read the Bible again right so the thing about God is he he
3:12
releases when he when he wants to you you know um as you seek him you will
3:18
discover more and more of him he wants you to keep seeking him he will unfold more and more as time goes on in his
3:24
perfect timing so um I mean even with me even for me
3:30
I knew that casting out demons would be a part of my Ministry a part of my
3:36
purpose when I received the word upon my life that I was called to be an apostle that I was called to reach the Nations
3:42
and all that um looking back I think I think the whole casting out of Demon
3:47
thought was maybe very tiny I wasn't even thinking too much about it um I guess because it's so rare I think
3:53
because it's so rare uh rare today I was thinking about more of healings and
3:58
things like that you know um but but like when the first demon manifested
4:06
and it and and God freed the person at the woman at my at FF Church in the park
4:14
um there was so much I had to learn about casting out demons at that point there was so much that I still needed to
4:22
learn and it was like you know the way God Did It For Me was he
4:27
didn't give me all this toiv delance training specifically Deliverance training and then on that day in 2021 in
4:35
March say okay you've graduated Deliverance training and now you're ready so I'm going to make the anointing
4:41
flow through you and make a demon tremble that's not how it worked for me it was like God began to teach
4:48
me um at that point at that point even as
4:54
as that as it started to happen as demons manifested and and God was moving in power where I would ask my spiritual
5:00
father I would then ask my spiritual father like this demon was being like stubborn you know um this happened and
5:08
this you know what what to do in this situation what was going on in the spiritual
5:13
realm uh that you know that so the really the learning about Deliverance happened after um the first demon was
5:23
cast out in my Ministry actually even though I could have learned it before even though my spiritual father could
5:29
have like told me everything before because he has been walking in powerful Deliverance
5:36
Ministry of Deliverance for so many years you know but it just wasn't God's timing I learn I've learned about God's
5:42
ways and um through that you know his ways of teaching and releasing uh the thing I learned is that
5:50
it it's it's how he keeps us humble it's how he keeps us humble cuz if you know
5:57
um you know if I invited you over to spend a week with me and I just stayed
6:03
with you every day and I'm like okay I'm going to tell you everything you need to know everything you need to know um and
6:09
then after that week you'd be like feeling like a professional you don't need to know anything else um I think
6:15
that's why that would that would be um more difficult to stay humble I think that's I I believe that's why God does
6:21
it that way uh that he withholds so you're not a professional he gives you
6:27
little little at a time um but doesn't reveal everything so you
6:33
are constantly reminded that you are a student that you haven't reach that professional level where you know
6:40
everything um that even when you are a teacher you remain teachable because there's still more things for you to
6:45
learn where professions in life it's not that way professions in life you you you
6:51
you finished law school you know everything right you finish do medical school you know like everything pretty
6:57
much in in your field in your field you know everything but that's not that's not how it is in the Kingdom so um when
7:04
it comes back to reading the word of God it's that same principle where uh what I just want to share with you is to not be
7:11
um not be discouraged if there's something in the word you don't understand make note of it ask God to
7:19
reveal to you the meaning of it um and be teachable and humble and uh be
7:25
patient with God's timing like if you pray and you ask I really want to understand the meaning of the scripture
7:32
uh don't obsess over it you know maybe God will answer your prayer but it will come a month later or a year later or
7:38
two years later but the important thing to know is that God is releasing to you
7:44
what you need to know now what you need to know now God is releasing to you um
7:50
so for example [Music] um like in this revival right
7:58
now God isn't really concerned about the Revival Army being
8:06
um Professionals in the Book of Revelation for example like Professionals in the end times and
8:13
everything we we have a lot of work to do before before Jesus returns so it's
8:19
like God wants us to be focused on the preparation rather than the actual end
8:26
times that's just an example right there for you that God is releasing to you what you need to know now so don't be
8:33
discouraged don't be obsessed if you're not understanding the certain
8:39
scripture um the meaning of it also just another thing um to mention
8:45
is that maybe you you you're you're you're not understanding the meaning of a scripture because there's conflict
8:51
towards it um I want I taught I taught a message about this how to hear God's voice in
8:58
the word word um a month or so ago it's on my YouTube and I think it's called how to
9:05
hear God's voice in the word I think that's what it's called but I actually really taught you I taught in that
9:11
message different examples where seemingly contradicting scriptures those
9:17
are you many times ones that people just don't understand and so I those are those are ones that God does want you to
9:23
understand the ones that I went over because like our Apostles around today God wants you to know that now he
9:30
doesn't want this to be revealed to you later he wants to know he wants you to know this now um Can women preach lead
9:36
minister is that biblical is that what God wants this is what you should know now the truth um spiritual fathers and
9:44
mothers are they biblical this is something you should know you need to know now all these are important things you must know now that's the thing about
9:49
the word there's some things you need to know now and then maybe there's other things that you're obsessing over just
9:55
for the sake of knowledge that God doesn't need you to know full and depth be focused and distracted over here when
10:01
he wants you to learn something different so go check out that message if you haven't seen it already um and there I basically break down
10:08
like how to understand the word Beyond those examples because I I share basically
10:14
like religion comes with a wrong Revelation many times and that whenever
10:20
there's these contradicting it's it's like Pharisees versus Jesus it's old wine versus new wine and there's so much
10:26
old wine today there's so much religion there's so much Pharisee spirit so it does become a big conf a really a
10:34
confusion confusing um situation in the body of Christ in terms of certain
10:40
scriptures so that word that I shared will help you um because you'll start to
10:45
discern like oh that's why this is so confusing it's because all of this religion here so I know that the
10:52
religion way is the wrong way you'll know how to to discern when you understand
10:58
that are all Ministries considered churches especially as far as being
11:04
planted well in terms of like the meaning of church this is meaning um a
11:09
house of God that is open regularly for worship Gathering Together of
11:17
Believers and uh just as we see in the acts church and uh equipping happening
11:23
true equipping um anointed teaching and anointing being released to heal the
11:29
sick and cast out demons and to raise the dead and signs wonders and
11:35
miracles um and communion and
11:40
um uh sewing into God's kingdom uh this is just a little summary
11:47
of like a definition of church and the church and the church would be God's Ministry not man-made not uh a
11:57
man design designed by man um and the leader there and the leader
12:02
would be anointed by God would be um called by God to start that church and
12:09
to lead that church and as time goes on there are other leaders as well other other
12:16
Ministries in the F other Ministries in the fold Ministry that also come and
12:21
equip as well as time goes on beyond the first like early Pioneer
12:27
Stage uh as it grows so God wants every believer to be a part
12:35
of a church to be planted in a church and it can be online um especially in
12:43
the early days of pioneering when the power of God is rare where this kind of
12:48
church the real church is is hard to find um there is a is a a unique Grace
12:55
where God will call people to be planted online and then there will come a time later on
13:01
where there will be physical churches branches
13:07
near near where you're planted online different cities so um yeah then there's
13:14
different kinds of Ministries but they aren't really churches maybe they're just very specific but they're not doing
13:20
all of these things that I just went through um and so all of those things I just
13:27
mentioned like that's some important for a Believer to be a part of to be planted
13:33
there to be fully equipped not just have some sort of like specialty um you know Teaching Ministry
13:40
or something but uh that you are fully equipped you should be planted at a
13:46
church a church an actual Church yes question how to continually have a
13:53
deep revelation of God's love so so the answer is to remember
14:03
what God has revealed to you and cherish those memories and um bring them to the
14:09
Forefront of your mind because the the revelations that God gives of his love
14:15
are many times like a unique experience like a unique time where your eyes opened wow and then like it's it it's
14:23
just like one unique moment not like a revelation and then another Revelation and then another the Revelation another
14:29
Revelation but it's lifechanging for example when when I was baptized in the Holy
14:37
Spirit um it's so hard for me to even describe
14:43
I can't put into words um like what I experienced but I
14:48
just remember being baptized in the Holy Spirit and then all of a sudden it just clicked in me how amazing God is and how
14:57
much he loves me and how he's never left me and how he knows everything about me
15:03
and how he's so for me and how his plans for me are so good and how Almighty he
15:09
is How Majestic he is how massive he is
15:14
and how small I am and how um I mean
15:19
he's the Creator and I'm the creation and how H who am I to think I know what's
15:27
best for my life God must know the best plans for my life and throw my dreams
15:33
out the window I just want Gods like all of that just came in like an instant I
15:38
didn't even like see any kind of vision or anything like it was just I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and then
15:44
just my spiritual eyes opened up to all these things just became an knowing and
15:50
it changed my life forever just that one simple very quick moment Revelation it
15:55
wasn't like a 2hour revelation it was literally like like a split second all of this knowing came to
16:02
me and um that was that
16:07
was almost eight years ago now and um because of that one
16:15
Revelation I surrendered to God and I've grown in that surrender every day since
16:21
then um but I didn't have like that same you know a revelation again the next day
16:26
and again but it was just one that changed everything um that's just one
16:32
example and then of course there was more along the way but um yeah what what
16:38
I'm what what's important to know is that you you don't need to like be missing like longing oh I wish I had
16:45
like another really Grand powerful revelation God wants you to Value what he's giv you and he wants you to realize
16:51
that when he's opened up your eyes that's enough he's opened up your eyes already stop don't Crave You know for
16:59
another wild experience be grateful for what you have now and don't let the
17:05
memory grow stale um don't let the memory grow stale by valuing it by remembering it thinking
17:12
about it thanking God for it thanking God for the Revelation if ever you're in a day where you feel distant from God or
17:21
you know um maybe lies of the devil are creeping in your head that are uh uh
17:26
making the voices of God's love quiet you need to know in this point you need
17:32
at this point you need to be very intentional to remember to spend time meditating on what God has revealed to
17:39
you God has opened up your eyes and we need to keep our eyes open the devil wants to shut them again um by by
17:48
pushing back that memory so far back that it's like you become asleep like your eyes you forget your eyes shut
17:55
again so your job is to to keep those eyes opened up by intentionally
18:03
remembering what God revealed to you remembering those precious life-changing
18:08
moments valuing them replaying them some of you have videos of those moments
18:13
replay those videos um some of you have journaled these moments read the journaling if you haven't journaled it
18:20
it's not too late even if it happened years ago Journal about it and make it a practice to go back and um read remember
18:27
I'm there's a story in the Bible of where they uh when when God split waters
18:35
for them to walk through they then put rocks down to memorialize what God has done so they wouldn't forget the amazing
18:42
miracle that God did so we have to put stones down in our lives by journaling
18:48
by meditating remembering intentionally thanking God for these these encounters
18:54
these experiences amen if someone wants Deliverance as I'm
19:01
witnessed seen on the street should I cast them out I was told not to because he couldn't maintain
19:07
it so um the important thing to realize like when
19:12
you're when you're witnessing to people on the street if you're witnessing people on the street just anywhere in
19:17
public you you want to have this heart that they're not getting an easy fix but
19:25
that they're going to really be saved discipled maintain their
19:32
Deliverance you know have this kind of like mature heart for them and
19:38
understanding how things operate in the spiritual realm right so um when you're
19:44
witnessing on the street it's so important that you share like if you share your own
19:50
testimony share how you've been delivered and how God has saved you freed you transformed you his his
19:57
amazing love um if that person is like really opens
20:02
up and they're like I want what you have you know I I'm hungry if that happens
20:11
then number one it's so important for you to share your full testimony and share okay you can have exactly what I
20:17
have received but this is the way you know it's not like a easy quick fix or
20:23
something it's not just like a easy quick prayer I'll pray for you right now and that's it but you should share with
20:28
them the full testimony like how you are planted and how um powerful anointing
20:34
you encountered and that set you free Jesus Set You Free by his power and where you received that from the place
20:41
you received that from and how um you've been able to maintain it and
20:46
go glory to glory and not lose what you received the freedom you've received because you are planted because you you
20:54
attend regularly every single week so um that's just what's really important to
21:00
share and just gauge uh gauge as Holy Spirit uh uh speaks to you you know
21:07
leads you their their um openness their
21:12
interest their hunger because the truth is that some people they just aren't
21:17
interested and we have to respect that and not be
21:23
wasting time um playing around with demons you know what I mean because
21:29
people they need to desire Freedom they need to desire Freedom they need to want
21:35
to let go of their demons and a lot of people they want to keep their demons they genuinely want to
21:41
keep their demons like they genuinely enjoy living a sinful life and we can't
21:48
force them to be like us we can't force them to uh desire
21:53
Purity so what we can do is is Shine the Light and go slow with the Holy Spirit
21:59
like don't force plant seeds and um the really the most important thing you can
22:05
do is to invite them to church invite them to watch online um because now you're just
22:13
connecting to them them to powerful anointing in a place where they can be equipped a place where they can
22:20
continually receive from so that's that's the way to walk in
22:26
wisdom there um if the person you know you're talking
22:32
to them and they're saying like if they really really really opened up and they
22:38
um really like they re it's like a harvest like you can discern it's harvest time it's not just planning seed
22:45
time but it's harvest time these will these these times will be more few um
22:51
but when that time comes that it's really Harvest that they're like I want Jesus I want to receive what you have
22:58
I'm done with this life you know if you really can discern that and they say you
23:03
know I Want to Be Free of this anxiety I Want to Be Free of this addiction as Holy Spirit leads you can pray for them
23:09
you can command that Spirit to go but just make sure they are very open
23:15
um you have it's important to really discern that because you're if it's a place like on the street you're many
23:21
times going into their territory so they have to for it to be your territory in the spiritual realm your domain they
23:28
have to really open up they have to really desire to be free
23:33
whereas in the church if a person comes to church they are
23:41
completely in the domain like my domain for example that God's given me my
23:47
territory and it's it's their their action of surrender to God and and so
23:54
there there will be more situations where maybe someone was almost dragged there uh I remember this um teenage boy
24:02
he didn't want to come to church uh he want he was depressed all the time and he just wanted to stay in his room but
24:08
his mom uh brought him to church and I started praying for the family and as I started praying for the family he starts
24:15
manifesting and I command the demon to leave him and the demon left him and then he was on the ground for a while
24:21
and he comes up he stands up after a while and he says I can see he took off his glasses and he said he could see and
24:27
then he a testimony after service how he literally hadn't had he went to heaven he went to the throne room and um just
24:37
describes this encounter he had with Jesus where Jesus actually spoke to him and um you could tell it was so real
24:43
because he was like saying all this scripture that Jesus told him and he wasn't like spiritual at all and he was
24:49
so on fire um so that's like a unique situation where someone didn't really want to come to church but they ended up
24:56
coming and so because they came they were in like my authority in Christ my
25:03
territory domain so like all demons there they had to tremble and go um it's
25:09
not always that way there can be some people that they really have doors open so much and they come to church and um
25:16
they're not renouncing they're not doing the action of renouncing in their own life and so the demons have um legal uh
25:25
legal um Authority to stay because that person wants their demons still so even
25:31
though they came to church where the power of God is they really want their demons still but then there can be different scenarios where this where
25:38
that teenage boy he doesn't really want his demons but he he just doesn't know how amazing Jesus is and his power is so
25:44
he doesn't want to go to church as well you know and um also because his parent
25:49
came his parent brought him he's still a teenager he's young there's like an a
25:54
Grace there there's a Grace of the parent that extends there um to the child that the parent wanting
26:00
freedom for the child extends there uh uh so so yeah so back to what I was
26:07
saying like I guess I'm what I'm trying to say is it's a it's kind of like an overall a
26:12
safer environment and generally it's a safer environment for a person to truly be
26:18
delivered and maintain the Deliverance like at Church Holy Spirit really leads
26:23
me how to minister for example like um uh after um delivering someone sometimes
26:31
holy spirit will prophetically lead me to give them this instruction like sometimes the holy spirit will speak this person just came
26:38
to church just to get free and they're they don't want to come back like they think it's just an easy fix they haven't been educated on this yet they don't
26:44
have the spiritual knowledge yet so Holy Spirit Will Lead me after I I um command the demon to go and the demon leaves
26:50
them holy spirit will lead me to to give them prophetic instruction like keep coming back this is very very important
26:59
or um sometimes holy spirit will lead me prophetically to share with them if the
27:05
devil tries to lie to you you have to walk in your Authority and command those lies to go you have been free don't let
27:11
them lie to you because holy spirit's revealing to me this specific person um this is the strategy of the devil the
27:18
devil's going to try really hard to take the freedom and they need to be educated in the spiritual realm that um they can
27:23
have victory over the devil but they have to go to war in the spirit from so um and then at the end of every service
27:30
you know we well at the end of every service I I share most Services I share
27:37
um it's not about the feeling you have received teaching them spiritual
27:43
principles um declare that you're healed you're freed and uh we always announce
27:49
it's very important you watch the maintaining your deliverance messages like there's just a lot that um a lot of
27:56
like safeguard a lot of um just things to really help people
28:02
maintain their freedom and grow as a disciple and go glory to glory at the
28:08
church so that's why I say if you're witnessing out in the street witnessing other places it's it can be dangerous if
28:14
you're just like casting out the demon and leaving and even just even it's not enough to just quickly mention um oh you
28:23
should tune in to the church I go to you know like you really have to walk in wisdom with the Holy Spirit like is this
28:28
person ready and also like um understanding
28:34
that like where you're receiving from that's a high level anointing and if
28:41
this this person might need higher level anointing to free them from
28:47
everything so we want to have that heart that they are freed from everything and that they're maintaining that freedom
28:54
and that they're receiving anointing upon their lives so really to answer question it's just so
28:59
Ser it's just what you should really impress upon them the most is the seriousness of um getting under the
29:05
shadow of apostle Peter right like getting under the shadow of apostle Peter we want to make sure they come and
29:11
stay where the anointing is because when as the Bible says when one demon leaves they're uh it's looking to come back
29:18
with many more and so people that are out in the street or something that um
29:24
maybe they're not that hungry for Jesus yet um and you just cast a demon out of them lots of times they're not going to
29:31
be serious about maintaining their freedom and so it could be it could come worse I'm not meaning that we don't we
29:38
don't need that we should be like afraid to cast out demons I don't mean it in that way but I'm just saying this is why
29:44
I'm stressing the importance of Church of getting them to church that's instead
29:51
of us being like Oh I have the anointing I'm ready to cast out demons let's walk in wisdom and get them
29:57
to church so that they can be safe they can have a covering the the anointing protecting them and um they can maintain
30:04
the freedom and be discipled and go glory to glory is it wrong to say you hate the devil no that's the one person
30:13
you can hate not person thing you can hate so one thing you can hate yeah the
30:19
devil is pure evil there's he's past the point of any kind of
30:24
redemption he's past the point of like being saved and going to heaven he's
30:30
he's really made his decision um just like when people die
30:38
and they go to hell we can't really we can't pray for them to go to heaven there it's you know
30:45
it once the Judgment of God has happened it's it's done it's it's Eternal so
30:53
that's how it is for the devil so um yeah in fact it's it's good to hate
30:59
the devil because that's where we should focus hate sometimes a lot of times people feel hatred towards people but
31:05
they should really just hate the devil and we always want to have victory over the devil we never want the devil to win
31:13
and the devil is pure evil the devil all he does is steal kill and destroy he has
31:18
no mercy or Grace on anybody on anyone so it's absolutely accurate to say you
31:24
hate the devil how do you minister to non-believers um I think I've shared a
31:31
lot of this recently um about planting seeds about loving and being the brightest light you can be I think I I
31:39
believe I shared a lot of a lot about this you can go back and watch my message for more on this on
31:46
um uh minist uh religion free ministry I think
31:52
the message was called on on a Sunday at 5f and kind of the surrounding messages about that as well but
31:59
um basically just love them love them love them love love them with the
32:04
supernatural Love Of Christ non-believers many times will have demons and their demons will overtake
32:11
them so that they do evil things they um lash out at you when you didn't deserve
32:16
it um so situations like that when you show them Grace when you show them love when you're kind to them when they were
32:22
mean to you that really plants a seed because it's a supernatural love
32:27
that they've never encountered before probably and it really opens up their eyes it really shocks them and it feels
32:33
good it feels it's the you know it feels so good because people non-believers
32:41
they don't know the love of God and so they're never really feeling true true true true true love you know the
32:49
amazing um Unconditional Love Of Christ and that's what we all need so when you
32:55
don't have that you're feeling thirsty y all the time and so we are vessels of
33:00
God so when we love someone when they don't deserve it when we show them that Mercy we're literally the hands and feet
33:06
of Jesus we're literally like Jesus to them Jesus in US is is loving them
33:12
they're getting a taste of who Jesus is even if they don't know it it plants a
33:17
seed and it's going to make a difference it's going to um plant a seed where even
33:23
maybe you didn't say that you were a Christian that's okay just it's not like you have to be like I loved you this way
33:30
that you didn't deserve cuz I'm a Christian you no no you don't have to like announce it like that but um maybe
33:37
another time later in life they will encounter that love of Christ again through a different vessel of God and
33:43
maybe they find out that they're a Christian or maybe they go on your social media and they're like what
33:50
what's what's so different about this person I can't shake that what I felt
33:56
with how they treated me I can't shake that and they they become interested they look at your social media and they see you're posting about God
34:03
testimonies um yeah it shouldn't be hard to see that you're a Believer on your social media that's a really great way
34:10
we can witness especially when we plant seeds and make people curious like what's so different about them I can't
34:16
shake it go to your social media and find the glory of God and so um maybe they'll just shrug
34:22
it off at first but then they'll come across someone else who treats them in this way uh with such love and they find
34:30
out that they're a Believer too and they'll connect the dots this is the one of the big ways that God plants seeds
34:35
and all of a sudden they find themselves like I want to try church out I because
34:40
I'm desperate or something and these Christians loved me like I Never Been
34:46
Loved Before so really to minister to non-believer is the biggest thing you can do is just love them love them where
34:52
they're at go slow with the Holy Spirit don't speed up past the Holy Spirit don't make it a mission to um get them
35:00
to say the sinners prayer you know don't feel like you have to be on this mission to recite the whole gospel to them just
35:06
love them where they're at and uh wait for them patiently wait for them to open
35:12
up and to ask you questions and then would be the proper time to start
35:17
witnessing in terms of like sharing your testimony sharing what God has done for you and when you when the time is right
35:24
it should be very um authentic and real and with
35:31
no weird religious Ambitions but it should be just honest honest testimony
35:38
sharing with the love for that person to really hear your
35:44
testimony it should be with a heart for a real seed to be planted rather than
35:50
this religious agenda I want another notch on my belt I want to add another
35:55
tally to the list of the people who I've gotten them to recite the sinner's prayer so I'll feel better about myself
36:01
that I've saved this many people um because they can read that and it it
36:07
it's given Christians a bad rep this religious motive because people aren't stupid and they can read right through
36:12
it and it feels creepy and gross to them so that's how you can minister to unbelievers just be natural authentic
36:19
original um loving love them where they're at and follow the Holy
36:25
Spirit I've been acces of putting you on a pedestal how do I know if I've actually done this or if I'm truly honoring you because you're my spiritual
36:32
mom um I've shared I think I was two weeks ago I shared on the spiritual Cuma
36:37
so if you haven't watched that watch that because that's I could repeat everything I I I shared there to really
36:46
answer this question thoroughly so please go back I think it's it's on YouTube now too I believe it was from
36:51
two weeks ago most of the spiritual Q&A was about honor the topic of honor the importance of honor the importance of
36:56
Honor honoring God's servants uh and so that's part one of the question of the answer that I'll
37:02
share with you um but so something I shared in that is that um the Western
37:09
culture the western church the Western the American Body of Christ the western
37:14
church um to be truthful really lacks Revelation on honor the importance of
37:19
Honor um honor is connected to receiving the anointing um as as it says in the
37:27
Bible give honor where honor is due and so if a lot of Honor if a lot of of a
37:34
lot of honor is doe then a lot of Honor should be given um you can't ever out
37:40
honor it honor and glorifying are two different things but to um to to glorify to give
37:51
glory to a person is basically saying like that they alone have done
37:58
everything not God um that's giving Glory that they have done the Miracles
38:05
that they are the ones that have all the power um that they are the ones that
38:10
alone that changed your life but God does every Miracle it is God's
38:18
power that does everything vessels are just vessels Servants of God are just
38:23
vessels where the anointing flows through so like I don't have any power I'm a vessel
38:30
that God puts power in but it does not like belong to me it doesn't morph into
38:36
my body or something where I'm like a superhero that has Supernatural Powers
38:42
you know um but I'm I'm just a vessel that God has put the power in but it's
38:50
completely his power completely his so whenever miracles happen it's God doing
38:57
all the Miracles he gets all the glory it's only by his
39:02
power and also with teaching and ano uh Revelation released it's God who gives
39:09
the Revelation it's God's power through the words coming out that um ignites
39:17
your spirit feeds your spirit um but that being said God chooses to use
39:23
vessels and he needs them he doesn't have them be robots but he needs them to
39:29
have free will so he needs them to obey so there is a C- laboring that takes
39:35
place between the servant of God and God there is like working together um God
39:42
has all the power God is doing most everything but the vessel does do a part
39:50
plays A Part um so how it should be in terms of um like
39:58
the proper way to make sure you're not glorifying putting on a pedestal too
40:03
much um Servants of God is just as you share
40:09
testimonies just make sure to make it clear that it's God who does everything
40:15
the best way to do it is you know I I was sharing even yesterday the importance of um sharing your full
40:23
testimony like don't just like see it can go bad either way if you say this
40:31
servant of God delivered me and you're not like in including God that you know
40:38
it was God's power that did it um even though it it's not like it's completely wrong because it says in the Bible God
40:45
says you heal the sick you cast out demons so it's not wrong to say she cast
40:50
out my demon it's not like it's wrong to say that but to to make sure God's
40:58
getting all the glory and to make sure it's not being misinterpreted especially because a lot
41:05
of people are so unaware of God's power today and also there's a lot of religion
41:12
that um can't stand honor even though God commands us to honor so just all
41:18
because of that it's it's important to share the full testimony which the full
41:23
testimony is just basically what I just shared how there's a c that takes place it's God's power that does everything
41:29
and he deserves all the glory so you should share your full testimony like I was delivered when I went to for example
41:36
fold church and Apostle Katherine um prayed for me or commanded the demon to go and by God's power the demon left all
41:43
glory to Jesus you can say I'm grateful for this servant of God for the servant of God's obedience um and I give all glory to God
41:52
I praise God I'm so grateful to God so the proper way way to both give honor to
41:58
the servant of God and and making sure you're giving glory to God Is by doing that by doing kind of what just shared
42:04
like sharing your the full testimony so you're making sure you're honoring the
42:10
servant of God and glorifying God and giving all the glory to God and that you know that's you're
42:17
you're just saying what is happening it's a coll laboring that takes place uh
42:22
and and um it can go the other way where I was mentioning yesterday how imagine
42:30
the times of Peter imagine if people were un were ashamed to say
42:36
that the shadow of Peter touched them and God's power healed and delivered
42:42
them through that shadow um or uh they were ashamed to say that a handkerchief
42:49
was placed on Apostle Paul and then the handkerchief went on their body and God's power flowed from Paul to the
42:55
handkerchief to them and they were delivered and they were healed imagine if they were unashamed because of the religious spirit and imagine if they
43:02
were just like I was delivered by God period God
43:08
delivered me of addiction God delivered me of anxiety those who went to Peter that was their testimony period but nothing else
43:14
they didn't share anything else and those that went to the ministry of apostle Paul um and received the handkerchief aprons imagine if they just
43:21
said I was healed of cancer period they didn't say anything else they they share this testimony far and wide and it does
43:28
one good thing that it lifts faith that God can heal and deliver but it leaves
43:34
people stuck crying in their bedrooms praying for healing and deliverance and it never happening many times because
43:41
God has a certain system of moving in power and he doesn't go against his word
43:47
his system his principle um he doesn't go against it because people are uncomfortable with it because people
43:52
don't like it because um people are afraid of the spirit of religion
43:57
attacking them no God stays true to his principles to his system to his word and
44:03
so um the the people in Peter's time and Paul's time if if people did not share
44:09
that full testimony that they went to Apostle Peter's Ministry the anointing of God
44:16
flowing through them flowing through him touched them and and God's power healed
44:22
them and delivered them glory to God um and thank you you Peter for your ministry you know and same with Paul if
44:29
they didn't do that then people wouldn't find Peter's Shadow and they would stay
44:35
in sickness and bondage for the most part because this is God's main way of moving in power it's so clear in the
44:41
book of Acts you know like it doesn't say like oh this was one of the rare ways that God moved and everyone else
44:48
just prayed to God for healing and deliverance and their bedrooms by themselves it doesn't say that are
44:53
examples of Miracles happening of of healing happening of Freedom happening of signs and wonders happening were
45:00
through the apostles we through the fful ministers in the acts church that's our
45:06
example so so we can see that that is really God's way so to be truthful it is
45:13
it's it's really actually displeasing to God to withhold part of the testimony of
45:18
where you got healed and delivered and how it happened to just simply say God delivered me because
45:27
the reason why you're saying it that way is because you're unashamed is because you're ashamed of God's servant of God's
45:33
system of God's way of releasing his power um
45:39
so the so back to the question um putting someone on a pedestal an example of this is I say
45:48
this often at at church because I think sometimes I think there are some there are some people that are like so focused
45:54
on receiving one-on-one prayer for me um and it's not a bad thing to desire
45:59
one-on-one prayer from a servant of God it's not like it's a bad thing but if you are just like obsessed with that and
46:06
you're you're you know you're coming to the church you're coming to the Revival as now event you're coming to aive just
46:11
thinking like she needs to pray for me she needs to pray for me I want her to pray for me so I can be healed so I can be freed of this thing I want her to
46:17
pray for me that's that's that's putting on a putting putting me on a pedestal um
46:25
you the heart should be I want God to heal me I want God to deliver me I
46:30
believe God's going to heal me he's going to deliver me he's going to touch me I understand how God releases his
46:36
power he anoints his servants he anoints his his ministers he anoints his
46:42
Apostles and here is an apostle he has anointed he is moving through so I am
46:48
coming to the church I am coming to the Revival now I am coming to the live expectant to have an encounter with God
46:54
to meet Jesus Jesus I'm expected and hungry for God to touch me for God to move through the vessel and touch me and
47:03
so that Focus was completely on God it didn't you know the focus was completely
47:08
the focus was completely on like what they're receiving through me not from
47:15
me the real power the real thing the real thing that that releases healing
47:21
and deliverance and true life is Jesus it is
47:27
not Apostle Katherine and Jesus it's Jesus Apostle Katherine's The Vessel so um you know in your heart you
47:35
should just be like honoring like thank you so thank you for your obedience so
47:41
that God himself can move through you you know instead of like seeing us on
47:48
the same seeing God in Me or God and the servant as like the same level or something no no no it's all your like
47:53
your gratitude should all be about your gratitude and honor should be be for that you're grateful for the obedience
48:00
so God can move through and you can receive from God right
48:07
um the heart should be I'm I'm hungry and expectant and excited to encounter
48:13
Jesus so when that's your heart you will accept you will you will be more open to
48:21
receive that instruction the knowledge that I share the spiritual knowledge that I share of how
48:26
the anointing flows of what makes it to come it's has nothing to do with one-on-one prayer but everything to do with the authority of Christ executed
48:34
the anointing so powerfully moving across the screen and how one prayer is
48:40
just one way that God tou comes through and touches his people so if you're if
48:45
you're putting someone on a pedestal you won't really have ears to hear that you know but but if you are really after
48:54
God's heart because I'm after God's heart so when you listen to me for example we're on the same page and you
49:00
agree you're like yes I'm after God's heart too so so you when I when I share
49:05
these words you're hear you're you're like you're taking them in you're intaking them so when I share this truth
49:13
that you shouldn't be um obsessed with one-on-one prayer you need to have your eyes on Jesus and you need to surrender
49:20
to how he wants to move and touch you and that might not be through one-on-one prayer pray so come here
49:26
looking at Jesus close your eyes and focus on Jesus and and
49:32
so the heart that is right that is pure that is not putting me or a servant of
49:37
God on a pedestal will receive it you want God you want Jesus you don't want
49:42
an encounter with a person you want an encounter with Jesus so you'll receive that word and you'll accept it and you'll be obedient to God with that word
49:50
that's being released and then you'll encounter him but so a lot of people
49:56
that that won't receive that word it's because they're not really after God's heart and they're looking too much at
50:03
the at the vessel and so they are um putting them on a pedestal so for a lot of people it doesn't even look like
50:09
they're most of the times when people are putting a servant of God wrongly in the pedestal it's not looking like
50:14
honoring actually it's not looking like oh they're so
50:20
amazing but it's rather this stubbornness of like pray for me pray for me like the stubbornness of like I
50:27
need you to pray for me it's they're not even being actually honoring if that makes sense their eyes
50:33
are focused on the minister not on Jesus and they're not but they're not even being honoring to the minister because
50:39
honor is beautiful and it is pure amen so um because a religious spirit is
50:48
so huge um in the western church in the
50:54
American church and a big part of the religious spirit is that they hate honor is that they think that honor is
50:59
glorifying man when it's that's so not true and honor is so important and it's one of the biggest keys of receiving the
51:08
anointing and so you have to be aware of that that when you do honor it will be
51:14
seen as glorifying a person by religious people you just have to be aware of that
51:20
I'm full aware of that I've gotten just the most ridiculous
51:26
um false accusations and hatred thrown at me for with people thinking that I
51:33
glorify my spiritual father and it's only it's been nothing but honor but I'm
51:39
just I've just accepted that truth that there will be people who don't understand it's not going to keep me
51:44
from honoring I must honor this is important to God so don't let that um
51:52
don't let the spirit of religion confuse you that you're like doing something wrong or something something that's what the spirit of religion wants you to do
51:58
so you will stop and you and you will you will stop short of receiving the
52:03
anointing what would you say to a person who says Deliverance should not be videoed and sees it as embarrassing the
52:10
person well first of all all of the Deliverance that are recorded in the Bible they
52:16
were at least most of them were really public in front of a lot of people and
52:23
the in the acts Church there was deliverances taking place all the time in the church publicly in front of a lot
52:30
of people um and Peter's Shadow I mean that wasn't a private in a in a small
52:38
room Peter praying for somebody one-on-one type thing it was a mass Deliverance happening in front of tons
52:44
of people happening in front of thousands of people and this was for the glory of God when Deliverance is taking
52:51
place um for people to see it opens up eyes in the spiritual realm to the
52:58
reality of the spiritual realm to the reality that it's the devil it is demons that demons exist and that this is behind all of these issues of Oppression
53:07
um all of these issues that people have in their lives and the good news that Jesus loves us so much and he has power
53:14
that is more powerful than all these oppressions of demons and that he frees people he takes it from them and
53:22
spiritual eyes open up like never before to really see it with your own eyes to witness and
53:29
so one of the most important reasons that public deliverances are public that
53:34
they are publicized to the extent of being videoed where even more can be reached across the world one of the
53:40
biggest reasons it's so important is for Spiritual eyes to open up is so that
53:46
those people who are watching the videos who have addiction depression anxiety whatever the bondage that they can see
53:53
that that their eyes can open up that they can know what's happening in the spiritual realm I have demonic
53:59
oppression and Jesus can free me the Bible is real the Bible is
54:06
alive I want to come where the power of God is and be delivered like that person
54:13
and because that is what has taken place in a FAL Church there have been people
54:18
there are people every single Sunday for probably more than a year now that every week they've traveled from different
54:23
nations because the video has reached them in another Nation so what's the
54:28
most important is that God gets glorified so that the miracle is public so God can get the most Glory as it says
54:35
in the Book of Psalms publish my works it literally says publish there's one
54:41
translation that says publish my Works across the Nations
54:47
publish them publish so um they didn't have video in the times of Jesus but I
54:52
know that if they did everything would be recorded it would
54:58
all the Miracles would be recorded for all the world to see this is such an amazing time exciting time we live in today where not only can um eyes open up
55:06
but people across the whole entire world but people can be delivered healed oh my word I mean there's just there's so many
55:13
things I could say about this like I'm just remembering that precious young man in the Philippines he was watching a
55:20
public Deliverance one-on-one prayer I was praying for someone else and as he was watching it the power of God moved
55:26
through the screen and touch him and he got delivered no wonder there's an
55:32
argument that um deliverances shouldn't be publicized should not be recorded no
55:38
wonder the devil does not want this to happen because when these videos are going
55:45
public it means that a million birds are killed with two stones like instead of
55:51
one demon being cast out in a private room thousands can can be cast out can you imagine as the as the Revival
55:58
increases can you imagine the amount of people who will be set free through one
56:04
video broadcast through one live stream I don't even know how many are now will
56:09
know in heaven the amount I can't wait I mean already thousands are being
56:14
delivered through a video um I remember the first video that went viral this is
56:21
before demons even were starting to be cast out I mean but the power of God moved through it and that I never even
56:27
um got to read all of the testimonies there was thousands of testimonies of people being delivered and healed while watching the video so um it's more
56:36
important that people's eyes are opened up so that they can be led to Jesus and
56:41
led to freedom and healing and his inheritance it's more important for the power of God to move through the videos
56:47
of these deliverances and touch others across the world and deliver them and heal them it is more important that
56:56
souls are saved healed and delivered than how a person
57:04
[Music] um think uh their appearance their appearance you know um that's what it
57:11
comes down to if we are concerned that a person is doesn't like how their hair
57:17
looks doesn't look how their face looks when the powerful anointing makes a
57:23
demon to manifest and come out of the person when we're more if we're
57:29
concerned more concerned about that than people being saved healed and delivered that means so so many Souls aren't being
57:35
saved healed and delivered that could be it's it's really actually Sil when you think about it if you're more concerned
57:41
about how we look than people being saved from demons and and being saved
57:50
from an eternity of hell
57:55
you know what I mean it's pretty a big it's pretty serious if you think of it like that but it's true it's true I just
58:03
I'm amazed at the amount of testimonies that come in constantly that I read constantly that I can't post them all of
58:08
people who have been delivered healed and saved by watching these videos by watching videos of
58:15
Deliverance of other people so um when people come to a place
58:21
where Deliverance is recorded that means that they've humbled thems and they've come to a place where they really want
58:27
Jesus to have his way they are surrendered fully to Jesus which includes surrendering their ego surren
58:32
surrendering how they may look surrendering the fact that demons may make their face and body contort as they
58:38
come out they've surrendered that they would rather have freedom and they would rather um rather give full glory to
58:46
Jesus than um than caring how they
58:52
look that's what it means when a person shows up to a church service where they know full well that cameras are there
59:00
and they've even they've even come because they've seen the videos the the videos were a blessing to them because
59:06
now they're going to be able to be delivered because the videos have been out right so they've given permission by
59:12
coming there themselves they've given permission to God for him to move upon
59:18
them and publicize what he's done and to the ministry they've given permission if
59:24
they are in the point where they care what they think more than giving the glory to God and soul saved healed and
59:30
delivered then they shouldn't come and they should humble themselves and get to
59:35
a place of surrender where they can be free of um they can be free of caring
59:42
what people think so much and desire God more than that what would you say to people that
59:47
haven't experienced the power of God and see the Deliverance videos and they think falling backwards is not biblical
59:53
they're being religious and they're taking um scriptures out of context and if
59:58
people are so focused on that then they are being prideful and not humble and so
1:00:04
um if people are really hung up that people are falling back with the power of God um they're probably not in a
1:00:12
place to receive so just love them where they're at if they really have a pure heart of knowing then you can um share
1:00:19
with them there's many scriptures I don't have them all prepared right now but there's many scriptures
1:00:25
uh I it was a sermon I did a while ago I don't remember the name of it though um but there there there are many
1:00:31
scriptures of people falling falling falling backwards under the power of God
1:00:37
so um if they really have a heart to know you should you should share with them that we should we are called to
1:00:43
look at the fruits we um don't be hung up on um the positions that people are
1:00:48
falling back but rather um focus on the testimonies that people are being healed
1:00:54
and delivered and touched by God it's very religious to focus on these these picky picky things and
1:01:03
they're not seeing the big picture that people are being saved and healed and delivered
1:01:09
amen amen God's God's power is so mighty that um our body sometimes the body
1:01:17
cannot stand it's a simple as that there's many verses in the Bible that says they could not stand on the glory of God this is not saying that they were
1:01:24
all falling forwards and smashing their faces on the ground it just say they could not stand
1:01:30
under the glory of God so when someone falls back I mean we see it we see many things many times they're falling
1:01:35
forward many times they're falling back many times they're um just brought to their knees like they can't stand
1:01:41
anymore and they just it's just God's power is so powerful that we become like
1:01:48
limp and unconscious and for a moment for God to do a powerful work like how he did spiritual surgery on Adam to
1:01:54
create Eve had to lay him down [Laughter]
1:02:00
amen I want to declare over all of you right now for more of this anointing to
1:02:08
come upon you today and in your life I declare right now all heaviness be
1:02:15
lifted off you all tiredness all sluggishness be lifted off in Jesus name I declare every heaviness that the
1:02:22
spirit of religion has brought all discouragement confusion I declare that
1:02:27
to go and be lifted now in jesus' name I declare the lies of the devil that have
1:02:36
tried to silence the voice of God's love in you the memory of Revelations God has
1:02:41
given you of his love I declare these voices of the devil of condemnation of shame to go in jesus'
1:02:48
name I declare all of these feelings
1:02:54
that God is far that you're not doing enough all the spirit of religion junk
1:03:00
must get out now in Jesus name stop worrying about if you are far
1:03:08
from God the I see a scheme of the devil right now that is just bringing
1:03:13
condemnation trying to make you feel like you're not doing enough when when God is proud of you when he's delighting
1:03:18
in you when you are indeed obeying him you are indeed in his will when you are even in a season right now where he's
1:03:25
coming in a small still voice when in past Seasons he came in a a a earthquake
1:03:31
and fire and large and wind um huge encounters but right now he's coming in
1:03:39
a still Small Voice he's coming in a still Small Voice and testing you and
1:03:44
maturing you that you would be content with his still Small Voice that you
1:03:49
would be um spiritually mature to renew your mind of what his voice is speaking
1:03:55
to you all the time rather than relying on your feelings and encounters but that
1:04:01
you would value what God has already given you and shown you may your eyes open up to God's love may you may your
1:04:09
mind be renewed now may your mind remember all that God has done all the
1:04:15
revelations he's shown you his great love and I speak this anointing to come upon you now in new levels may God's
1:04:23
love fill you surround you I speak protection upon you I speak peace and
1:04:29
joy to fill you now in Jesus name may your eyes open up in the spiritual realm
1:04:34
to see God's love and adoration for you may your eyes open up in the spiritual realm to see how hated you are of the
1:04:40
devil and that's why you've been having these condemning thoughts they are lies
1:04:45
be strong Grow Up Walk In God's love be confident of God's love and be a warrior
1:04:53
who who will not live listen to The Devil's lies anymore amen amen
1:04:59
hallelujah thank you Jesus I want to declare now over over Israel I speak
1:05:07
peace I speak protection I declare an end to all evil in jesus' name I declare
1:05:16
an end to Death of innocent people and harm to innocent people in in Israel and
1:05:22
all surrounding Israel everyone involved in the war I just declare over all the
1:05:27
innocent people from whatever country they're from protection over them peace
1:05:32
over them and that conviction would come upon those bringing harm and the evil
1:05:40
would stop in Jesus name in Jesus name
1:05:45
amen
