Can you be planted at more than one church
0:00
can you be planted at more than one Church no just like a tree cannot be
0:06
planted in two places at one time it can only be planted in one this is God's
0:11
principle this is how we flourish and grow he gives us all we need at the one
0:17
place he's calling us to be planted I have a whole message on our uh
0:24
I think I'm trying to remember what the message is but I teach in depth about communion and the new wine principle of
0:30
taking communion um I teach about it in the
0:35
Easter message um this past Easter and so it's really um important
0:44
to get the full understanding the full teaching of that to fully
0:49
understand because many people do it in a religious traditional way and so we are coming out of the old wine old
0:56
traditional way and coming into the new wine and doing things how God wants them to be led by the Holy Spirit not led by
1:03
tradition and religion one of the most important things you can do is be receiving
1:10
anointing and be receiving teaching being fed spiritually so if that's what
1:16
you're spending a lot of time doing that's wise and that's good so um you
1:22
you can't really go wrong in positioning yourself where the
1:27
anointing is and feeding your self receiving the important words the
1:32
important teachings sometimes God will take people on Seasons where he just wants them to really focus on receiving
1:40
so much we should always be focused on receiving but there's different seasons like there's a season there'll be a
1:45
season sometimes especially when God first brings someone into his new wine
1:52
like they've been maybe under religion for a while they've been in
1:57
bondage and then God brings them into the new wine there is so much to learn there is
2:05
so much to clean there is so much that God has to do
2:10
and many times God doesn't want to take like so so so so long for a person to
2:18
grow you know like you might have to really focus on receiving listening to
2:24
teachings a lot in the beginning so God can catch you up you know and so that
2:31
you wouldn't be going at such a slow pace and still a baby he may want to
2:37
mature you faster so that you're not being beaten up by the devil right
2:42
because so much of the spiritual food that comes through teaching that comes through God's anointed Ministries is to
2:49
equip you is to make you aware of the enemy schemes to open your eyes up to um
2:56
how the devil works and so let's say you just just learn one of these schemes but the devil's coming in 10 15 different
3:05
different kinds of schemes you'll still be at this immature
3:10
baby place of being beaten up by the enemy so when God first brings someone
3:17
like opens their eyes up to the truth what I mean by that is the they've been
3:23
fed spiritual uh milk for so long they've been under religion they didn't know the
3:30
deeper things of the spiritual realm the things that are needed for them to be equipped to be victorious over the devil
3:37
and so now God brings them into the new wine there's so much to learn there's so
3:43
much to know and so many times God will really call a person
3:49
to really spend a lot of time being fed
3:54
receiving getting your eyes opened up and then once That season can pass that
4:01
season can pass of where it's like so much time there because you have really
4:06
grown so much that now you're able to do other things like do focus more on
4:12
serving God F focus more on the work of God um you're you're able to now kind of
4:17
like do more for the Kingdom so at first you're not really doing much for the kingdom you're being prepared to do
4:24
things for the kingdom then you grow you've grown to a place where you can do
4:29
Mighty things for the kingdom because the devil's not going to um take you down you're strong you're
4:38
equipped how do you find your spiritual father or mother well it's quite simple
How do you find your spiritual father or mother
4:46
um a spiritual father or mother is a leader of a work of God a Ministry a
4:51
church so the spiritual father or mother that's out there for you is going to be
4:57
someone like Elijah or someone some like Moses or someone like Apostle Paul whom God has given them an assignment on this
5:04
Earth a great work of God and we work as a team we work as a body so many times
5:10
we can be thinking like I need to find one person to help me fulfill my purpose
5:16
specifically me like individualistic kind of thinking when really we need to think more Kingdom Minded we need to
5:22
think of we need to think about this God is doing a big work he's doing a big
5:29
work here he's doing a big work here he's doing a big work here that he has assigned an Elijah of today to lead and
5:35
a Moses of today to lead an apostle Paul of today to lead an apostle Peter of today to lead right different works it's
5:42
not that he's only doing one work he's doing different works and um all these
5:48
different leaders will have a Ministry because we we need a team of people we
5:55
need a body of people to make this work of God forth that God has called the
6:01
servant each servant to lead in and at
6:06
the same time at the Min the the people need to be equipped to serve God and to
6:11
be victorious over the enemy the the the people coming to help this work of God
6:16
go forth need to be equipped and the leader and other leaders in the church
6:22
like five-fold ministry will equip the people to be victorious over the enemy and to do
6:28
powerful things for God but the thing is is like so many times we're focused on my
6:33
personal purpose and we tend to think so individualistic like this is my purpose and this person over here that's their
6:39
person and this person over here that's their purpose and this person over here that's their purpose but really God sees
6:46
it so differently the reality is so different that God has something here he's doing something here he's doing
6:52
something here he's doing and God will call many different people to come here
6:58
to make this work of God go forth and to go here at this ministry at this church
7:03
to make this work of God go forth while they are here in this one church under
7:09
let's say Elijah Elijah of an Elijah of today they are being equipped to have
7:15
victory over the enemy and and equipped to be a powerful vessel of God and make
7:20
this work of God go forth here and so we have different things we're doing that
7:26
we have different things we're called to to make this work here go
7:33
forth like like when you think about Moses how he
7:39
um had this assignment to deliver the Israelites out of
7:45
Egypt and carry them uh uh lead them through the promised uh lead them to the
7:51
promised land lead them through the Wilderness be a mouthpiece of God to the people to speak to them to equip them
7:58
and to direct them of what where God has taking them what God's plan is and what
8:04
to do what to you know to not worship false gods you know to be grateful for
8:09
what God is doing equipping he's doing so he's called to that but then you have you you have you have Aaron you have
8:17
Caleb you have Joshua that are also there but but are not called to
8:22
something different their purpose is is to help fulfill
8:30
this assignment of getting everyone God's people out of Egypt through the
8:36
Wilderness into the promised land you see and so they all have different parts that they play Aaron's
8:44
role was was very different from Joshua's role role you know
8:51
so that's what many people don't grasp in when they're thinking they need a mentor they think they need a spiritual
8:57
father they sometimes s it's kind of seen as like in the world's way of a personal coach like this is my dream so
9:06
I need to find a personal coach to to help me achieve my dream that's not how it is in the
9:12
Kingdom um so in the church today you know let's say there's there's somebody
9:18
whose purpose is to um sing worship and
9:23
them singing worship is helping this work of God in for example what I'm
9:28
called to be leading this this revival that God is bringing the end time
9:34
Revival the the purifying of the Bride the transforming and purifying of the
9:40
bride and equipping the body opening their eyes to the spiritual
9:45
realm so they can have victory over the enemy and then be powerful vessels of God themselves to walk in God's power to
9:51
set other people free to Proclaim to the world Jesus is alive he's the same
9:57
yesterday as he was in the Gospels the ACT church as he is today receive him now um Etc all that God has called me to
10:06
lead he has called so many others to as well so like this one person here their
10:13
purpose is the same purpose as mine but they have a unique role in it as a
10:19
singer maybe singing worship and that's their role but it's not like my purpose is to be a worship leader no your your
10:26
purpose on this Earth is is to is to help God's work Advance help a specific
10:34
work that God is calling you to that so your purpose is your your
10:40
overall purpose is the same as many many many people but within that purpose you
10:45
have a specific role you have different roles in different seasons perhaps you are called to one thing this time you
10:52
were called to another thing this time you're called to help edit this time you're called to help prepare Revival events and here you're you're called to
11:00
help counsel people here you're called in different seasons to different roles so how to find a spiritual father mother
11:07
you need to not think of it in a worldly way of a find my personal coach to make my dream be achieved type thing or so
11:15
that I can have that personal um one-on-one time that many people think
11:22
of like personal coaches as but you need to think about this is a this is about
11:28
find finding where God is calling me to help Advance his work on this Earth and so
11:36
God will call you to a certain Ministries to a certain church he will reveal the fruits there he will reveal
11:42
it's real first of all number two you will be blessed there you'll be you'll be delivered if you need Deliverance
11:49
healed if you need healing you'll baptize in the Holy Spirit if that's what you need you'll receive equipping
11:54
your eyes will open up you will come closer to Jesus you will experience
11:59
God's power and his his kingdom on this earth when you come to that Ministry
12:05
that God's calling you to and the blessing it is in your life and how you've grown closer to God and seen more
12:12
of like Victory and his kingdom in your life that will be the simple not
12:18
complicated but simple sign simple voice of God saying I'm calling you here and
12:25
when you know you are called here you can already know your purpose so if you are called a fivefold church
12:31
for example you can already know your purpose maybe you don't know your specific roles yet and your roles can
12:37
change in different seasons you know your roles can change in different seasons but you will know
12:44
your purpose you will know I am called my purpose is the same as apostle Katherine's as my spiritual mothers once
12:51
you were called to that Ministry the leader of that Ministry becomes your spiritual father or
12:57
mother um so yes you you'll know this is my purpose my purpose is the same as
13:03
apostle Katherine's is the same as everyone who is here at this church and God will reveal more will be unfolded of
13:11
more will unfold of my specific roles in life to help Advance God's
When someone speaks death over your child
13:20
kingdom what to do how to respond when someone speaks death over your child like a grandparent saying your child is
13:26
dramatic so after the family memb spoke your child is
13:32
dramatic or whatever it is afterwards when you're not with them when you're
13:37
alone renounce that say I re and reject it I reject that word spoken over my
13:43
child I renounce that in that word can can have no power over my
13:49
child that's what you need to do spiritually and then relationally you can have a loving
13:56
conversation with them you can um hint to them what's not acceptable uh you can
14:05
you know you after they say something like they're dramatic and you can you can say you know I've really been learning
14:14
about the spiritual realm and the Power of Words you know speak it with love don't speak it in like a angry way you
14:21
know you speak this I've been learning about the Power of Words and so I'm
14:27
really not wanting to speak any words even though like any words negatively
14:34
any negative words even if they are like truth like re the reality you know I
14:40
don't want to speak it I I I'm just going to pray about it and I'm going to declare life over them and um speak what
14:49
I how I want them to be so I want them to be calm and
14:54
peaceful I they are calm they are peaceful I will declare this so you can
15:00
have you know a conversation kind of like that with a family member a friend
15:06
I'm just speaking with love and and since you are the parent most people
15:12
should respect um your Authority your higher
15:17
authority that you have than they do so respect your wishes so when you speak
15:23
lovingly you know sharing you know that's not it's not okay to say that
15:28
then they should respect and take the
15:34
hint but um don't have fear if people speak these things you go in the spirit
15:41
and reject it and it it cannot have power You' have commented before that we
Can we listen to other preachers
15:47
are to be planted and not go here and there can we listen to other preachers um can we listen to other
15:54
preachers yeah um Paul says you have many teachers but only one spiritual father so it's he's basically saying
16:00
it's very important you understand where your spiritual parent is that you don't get confused that you
16:07
know whom really God has called you to be planted under and really receive from
16:13
um what why this is important is because especially in today's time this
16:19
new wine that God is bringing he's bringing New Revelations I mean there's so so many people so many Ministries
16:27
that don't carry the power of God don't know how to access the power of God don't know what's going on in the
16:32
spiritual realm don't know how to cast out demons not really knowing the deeper things of the spirit the deeper things
16:39
of the spirit are come by Revelation Revelation from God so that's just one
16:46
aspect but there's so many different examples of how like old wine versus new
16:51
wine how in this revival this new thing that God's doing God is bringing new
16:56
revelation not new like outside of the Bible we're talking about new in our
17:02
generation and last generation and previous generation but it's in the word of God like what we see in the acts
New Revelation
17:08
Church what how we saw Jesus Minister and how we saw the church look like in the acts Church where the power of God
17:14
was there where the fful ministry was there where where demons were cast out people were healed people were raised
17:20
from the dead that is what God is restoring that
17:26
we haven't seen so much of so that's what I mean by a new thing I don't mean a a brand new thing out of nowhere I
17:31
mean new in our time so you have to realize that a lot of people don't have
17:37
the revelations yet or God just hasn't graced them to to have the New Revelations or have them yet and so they
17:45
cannot teach what they don't know they can't give what they don't have so um
17:52
it's just really important to walk in that wisdom and to Value what you have like if God calls you some calls you
17:58
somewhere to be planted it's it's important that you value that like for example if it is new wine and you are
18:06
receiving things that you didn't receive elsewhere like how the anointing and
18:13
deliverance and Revelations about the spiritual realm about the schemes of the devil that are really helping you if
18:20
you're receiving these like these new Revelations this new equipping this
18:25
these new things from God that you didn't receive elsewhere value that and have
18:34
understanding that it will continue as you continue there and and and and like
18:41
have value that that you're not wasting time listening to things that won't
18:48
really help you as much as you could be helped and blessed if you would stay
18:54
where you have been blessed and and another thing to keep in mind is that
19:01
um we're America and the Western world is very much a buffet style has like a
19:08
buffet lifestyle just in general uh I mean there's
19:13
just if you want to find someplace to eat like in my city in La it is overwhelming there's just too many
19:20
options um if if you want to find something to watch um a movie or
19:25
something you got all these different streaming places if you want to go find if you're
19:33
trying to find a shirt to buy you need a shirt it is overwhel I mean there's so many stores and because there's just so
Different Teachings
19:40
many options we tend to go here there here there Here There and um we see it as a
19:47
good thing we see like the buffet kind of lifestyle is a good thing but in the Kingdom the buffet
19:54
style it doesn't exist it's the the kingdom way is being
20:00
planted and um God I mean in different seasons God brings more different
20:07
teachers that carry different types of Things Different ministers at our church at fold church we will eventually have
20:13
uh the five-fold ministry in full effect we'll have a prophet and Prophets
20:19
multiple evangelists pastors and teachers but we are in this brand new
20:25
Revival that is the new stages that is the pioneering stages and it's just like in the same times with as it was where
20:33
the apostles were first sent out um it was just Apostles at first and
20:40
then we then see prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers all
20:45
joining and coming alongside so you know it's good to have
20:51
different kinds of teachings it's not like you only need to listen to one but it's just important to know the season
20:58
we're in in the spiritual realm it's important to keep in mind this important principle of being planted of not
21:05
getting confused with too many teachers too many different teachings and also
21:11
remember what I said earlier about God is calling you to one purpose I mean to a specific purp to a specific purpose
21:19
and that's going to be having to do with where you're planted and so what God is releasing there is
21:26
specifically food for you you it's the food you need right now because there's millions of topics in the spiritual
21:33
realm there's Mill I mean there's so many different topics so many the Bible
21:39
is large I mean there's so many we could be talking about the end times we can be
21:45
talking about angels we can be talking about uh uh um Visions we can talk be
Why
21:52
talking about dreams we can be talking about um the prophetic we can be talking about the fful ministry we can be
21:58
talking about spiritual warfare we can be talk there I mean there's just so many different topics there's millions
22:04
of teachings out there and we have to be careful that we're just not going after the ones that look fun and flashy and
22:13
interesting and cool because though there's nothing wrong with certain teachings some teachings there are some
22:18
teachings can be not good and not good Doctrine but there's a lot of really good teachings so there can be really
22:24
good teachings but doesn't mean that God's calling you to ingest all of them in this season right now you the there's
22:31
so many important reasons of why like why God's reasoning for us to be planted
22:37
like it's important for us to understand why right because that helps us um
22:44
adhere to God's commands when we understand the why have an understanding
22:49
rather than just being robots and just following the rules and that's it uh and so there's a lot of why
22:56
into like why God says we should be planted but one of the wise is
23:03
that when where you're where you're being planted God knows what you need to eat spiritually he knows for one like
23:11
the devil schemes and so he knows a teaching to bring you to help you have
23:16
Victory like in in a specific day or a specific week or specific month that he
23:21
sees the devil has planned for you and everyone who is called to this specific work of God like the like God knows what
23:29
the devil is brewing and and and and and so he releases that teaching through your
23:35
spiritual father or mother there or the the ministers at that Ministry there for you for specifically you to protect you
23:44
to to to to open your eyes of what the devil's about to do and so you can have
23:50
Victory so that's one of the one one of the reasons is like purely protection and
23:56
equipping because the devil like he'll go specifically after he wants to stop the work so he'll
24:03
he'll set people can be facing the same kind of attack in one Ministry at the
24:08
same time and another reason is this work that you are called to you need to
24:16
be you need to be very equipped in that work right
24:23
so God is calling you to a specific work we are called to a spe specific work
24:28
here at fivefold church and so there is a lot of focus on the fivefold ministry
24:35
what God is restoring right now what he's wanting to do right now restoring the fiful ministry the apostolic the
24:41
prophetic restoring the anointing the power of God Deliverance
24:47
healing and and teaching on the the the
24:53
the the deeper things of the spiritual realm the Intel of the enemy
24:58
uh knowing the enemy's schemes and how to overcome them the spiritual principles of how to have victory of how
25:06
to walk in authority so th those are like the the the the things that are
25:11
being taught on specifically um very much right and
25:18
that's how God wants it because this is how his work can advance we have to be
25:25
um really equipped in this area so we can be strong and Advance this specific
25:30
work not this work over here this work over here this work over here this work over here but specifically this work and
25:37
so it's kind of like if you're it's like a major in college right your major that
25:44
the major that that you're taking is it's like in the spiritual realm what your purpose is what you were called to
25:50
the ministry God calls you to You'll all have that same purpose that same calling um that's like your major and so in
25:58
college if you choose a major if you decide I know this is my
26:04
major but I'm just going to take whatever class is fun and I feel like
26:09
when you graduate you wouldn't first of all be able to graduate because you have to go
26:15
through all the the specific teachings but let's say that they allowed you to graduate you go to your job you are
26:21
going to be the least qualified person in that job um you're not going to be a
26:26
professional in that job job um you took a lot of classes you took just as many classes as everyone else you studied
26:32
just as hard as everyone else but you didn't do the right things to be
26:37
equipped and a professional at that major at what you were really called to do so that's one of the big reasons too
26:45
and so that's something that people really don't get a lot of times and and
26:50
a lot of it's because like I mean all churches so many churches are
Different Churches
26:56
like the same and there's not really this like big work that God is doing
27:02
this really important work and so a lot of people just see kind of every
27:08
Minister every church as like the same so if I just pick and choose here I'm
27:13
going to get everything I need but that's not how it works and it's
27:19
especially important to to to be aware of in this season
27:25
like like what God is doing in this season bringing this new wine um
27:31
purifying the whole bride transforming the whole bride restoring so much of
27:37
what was lost God is going to be doing this throughout the whole body like there
27:43
will there will come a time as as time goes on as years go by where there will be many churches who are teaching the
27:52
same appropriate things that God wants them to be teaching on uh like there in
27:58
other words it's going to be a lot of Ministries that are teach that are looking like the axe church so you have
28:06
ax church over here ax church over here or looking you know doing things like how the ax church was over here over here over here over here over here so if
28:12
you listen to a teacher here and here and here then that's that can be okay
28:18
you still need to walk in wisdom though because above all we need to make sure we're not neglecting where we're planted
28:25
but it can be okay because they're actually now in the new wine
28:31
carrying Revelation that God needs them to have um but in this season we have to be
28:39
sensitive to the seasons in this season we don't see that as much so you you
28:44
have to be aware of the seasons when it comes also to who you're listening
28:51
to like once your eyes are opened up you know you'll realize oh this
28:58
person that I used to listen to now I see they their eyes haven't opened up
29:03
like how mine have which is mind-blowing because like they're Minister and I'm not that was the Revelation that I had I
29:09
remember when I first um encountered the power of God and I first saw the reality
29:15
of anointing and I my eyes opened up about the fact that there's prophets and apostles that are around today and God's
29:21
using them in power to do Miracles and I saw demons be cast out um before my eyes
29:27
and it was like this is the most real thing I've ever seen in my life like it was like the first time I knew like this
29:35
is Jesus like I met Jesus as I witnessed
29:40
all of these things and as I heard anointed teaching that fed my spirit man and made it leap like it it never had
29:48
before so there was this knowing in me and this was this was um this was
29:56
like sevenish years ago that all this took place in for with me and I had been
30:02
listening to so many different teachers different teachings at this point um you
30:08
know I would have been a Christian my whole life and so I was listening to a lot big churches and but then like one
30:16
day my eyes opened up to all this and I remember being
30:22
like wait like I respect all these the the ministers so much you know
Awakening
30:29
and I I was so confused for a little bit I was like how do they not know how come
30:36
little old me like knows this now but they must not know cuz they're
30:43
not talking about it ever what I remember it was such a like
30:49
mindblowing moment and like sad moment
30:55
because it was just this revelation like so much of the American Church the
31:01
western church in general is really missing a lot of like the main part of
31:07
Jesus of his power people are being stuck in bondage nothing's being done I
31:14
remember it was like a heavy sad confusing moment for me and um and then
31:19
just God God just spoke to me about how God uses the weak and foolish things
31:26
how the last shall be first the first shall be last that God is revealing his Revelations to unexpected people and
31:37
this is just how it is this is just how it is this is just how it is so um yeah I mean so you have
31:46
to kind of have that same Awakening moment you know that I
31:53
did of like okay I used to listen listen here but now I realize like their eyes aren't
32:00
opened up the way mine have been and and and so I can't be equipped here now I
32:07
can't be fed here anymore that season's over it it did help me for a season for
32:14
sure brought me closer to God led me to seek him more but that season's done
32:20
now so you just have to walk in that wisdom of make like don't over complicate it where are you being the
32:27
Blessed the most receiving the most the fruits well first of all like where is God calling to be planted make sure you
32:35
aren't neglecting receiving from where you're planted make sure you're not
32:42
um the other thing the other thing is like God may be speaking one thing to
32:48
you let's say on a Sunday this message comes forth and this message has a lot to it it's not it's something that needs
32:54
to be digested it's something that needs to be listened to to again and again and
33:00
take notes on and meditate and be spending time with God like in
33:06
Repentance um maybe if you were convicted by something in the word and
33:12
really making change with God throughout the week based on what you receive from the
33:20
word making intention to apply the word so that that word changes you that word
33:27
is not just another thing you've listened to just like anything on TV you just listen to another thing you just
33:33
listen to In One Ear out the other but that that word became a part of you and
33:39
transformed you forever that's how God wants it to be you can really be actively growing and
33:45
changing every week every week you can grow so much if you would treat the word
33:51
with such wisdom and value like that but if you are just listening to the word
33:58
one time and then the next day you go and listen to a different word from somebody else and the next day you
34:05
listen to a different word from someone else and a different Minister and the next week next day you listen to a
34:10
different message from another Minister nothing's going on nothing's
34:16
happening with that very important word that came on Sunday that God had specifically for you where you are
34:22
planted nothing's happening with that it's not changing you you're not growing it's not being applied in your life um
34:30
it's not being valued so that's a way to walk in wisdom as well you know in terms
34:37
of making sure you're not listening to too much or like too many different
34:43
places and neglecting where you're planted what to do when you're planted
34:49
online but you have no equally yolked friends physically that's okay I mean God can
Sacrifices
34:57
use that as a season to um to refine you I mean there will be
35:05
Seasons where sacrifices are needed there will be Seasons where sacrifices
35:11
needed even in my own personal life I have a a great sacrifice that I had to
35:16
make and make continually I I've shared here before like I I was the most like
35:23
social butterfly outgoing had so many friends would be hanging out with friends all the time love to host people
35:29
over at my house I used to um like love having Bible study at my house and um
35:37
just bringing out tea for everyone and and goodies and just hosting them and
35:45
beautiful good thing you know and I used I used to just have so many friends and
35:50
just would hang out all the time like so so much of the time with people and now
35:57
god well first of all when God first called me to be an to be an apostle I had to really put up serious
36:05
boundaries and um just the so many people that were in my life at that time
36:10
just I was I was Adam going to be Abraham and
36:15
so or not Adam Abram so Abram God called
36:21
him to leave his land leave and go to a new land and that really was my life
36:27
like I had I had to do that it was really such a sacrifice and um even now to this to
36:34
this day I mean my life is is
36:39
Ministry and it just requires so much work and it requires so much to Pro uh
36:46
protect the anointing and spend time with God and there's just
36:52
so much importance and all of that that I I
36:58
cannot be hanging out here and there and here and there and so even to this day
37:04
I've had to really make sacrifice in terms of like what I want and my desires
37:09
and you know what I'd prefer and all of that and friends and everything like that I've had to make a sacrifice so in
37:17
terms of who I bring in close and so and and spend time so you know there are seasons where that
37:25
can be a sacrifice that can be absolutely a sacrifice when God is calling you maybe
37:31
to just be alone with him for a season in terms of physical friends and so that's okay just be okay with it and
37:38
real just just know The Importance of Being equally yolked and not letting the wrong people en close and that then God
37:46
takes care of the rest so if that means that it's a season of not having anyone
37:52
close really and physically then that's what God wants for That season seon he wants you to grow close to him in this
37:59
season and focus on your relationship with him and that let that be enough and
38:06
um and he wants you to also make sacrifice make a sacrifice in that area
38:13
and then there will be a new season there will be different seasons where God will bring because of your surrender because of your sacrifice because you're
38:19
obedient God will bring you the most amazing friends that you don't feel worthy of like you just see them as the
38:25
most Godly amazing people that love so well and you're like how are you my
38:32
friend I can't believe you're my friend like what because in your past relationships you never ever had people
38:38
treat you with such respect with such love um be so Godly like never ever
38:43
abuse you or manipulate you you never had that you always had maybe friends
38:49
mistreat you here and there at least and so now God's brought these people in your life that are so Godly
38:57
and you're like you can't even believe it because you've never had that and and it's like I'm worthy of this yes that's
39:04
what God wants for you but it doesn't just happen overnight God has to refine you and a big way he refines you is by
39:11
taking you through certain Seasons that require sacrifice in these different areas like many times not having someone
39:18
really close physically but just having Jesus but he will give you the people you need
39:23
because he doesn't want you to be like completely isolated he will give you people online you know online family he
39:29
will give you them and let that be let that be enough let that be just rest
39:34
just rest even though things um look different in this season it's okay
39:40
rest and I even see that from my life with um with John tall you know I never
39:45
had such a loving Godly friend as her in my life she's my spiritual daugh also my friend he's like a Jonathan um but I had
39:55
you know I had Christian friends I had lots of Christian friends but none of them were as Godly and
40:03
loving um and as wonderful as as jeal and so I see that like I had to make all
40:10
those sacrifices um but then I gained like this Supernatural friendship blessing
40:17
because of that and though I'm not able to have tons to bring in close it's
40:24
enough because it's it's so wonderful it's it's much better than than previously with with the wrong people
40:31
with the wrong people that weren't Godly completely weren't completely surrendered some having wrong ambition
40:39
some having jealousy things like this I'm still fasting for the people I had
40:44
prayed for using new age do I need to do anything else for their protection rest rest don't take too much on yourself you
40:52
know when it comes to ministering to God's people people it's important that we are
Release the anointing effectively
40:59
actually vessels of anointing by by positioning ourselves to receive anointing like being planted where God's
41:05
power is moving so that anointing can be imparted into your life and you can be
41:11
equipped of how to use the anointing release the anointing effectively and that spiritual covering protection is
41:17
upon you when you do go and Minister and as as you are planted there you'll be
41:24
equipped of how to effectively release the anointing such as um I've done a
41:30
teaching recently um I think it was titled it's on my playlist on YouTube on my YouTube
41:38
called um The Secret of the anointing playlist the series I've been doing about my book
41:45
um expanding upon my book uh there's a there's a message called I think how to release the anointing
41:53
effectively I think it's that one and I think there's another one the next week I think that was about how to like how
41:59
to cast out demons so for example on those teachings I teach about how you
42:04
can't just cast out demons any old way but you need to there's spiritual principles and rules we have to follow
42:10
like you you need to be using your Authority in Christ in your domain in
42:17
your territory here's a little quick example like this is my domain and territory on
42:23
this live and if someone were to come on and just start
42:30
um praying for someone even in the live or command demons to go in the live that
42:36
would be stepping into my territory and so we all have different territories so
42:42
you know you have to walk in you have to know the wisdom of that of how to release the notin effectively execute
42:50
your Authority in your domain that God's giv you in your territory and not going outside of those those um those those
42:59
rules because that's when that can be dangerous for yourself and the person you're praying for by bringing them
43:06
confusion so that's all you need to worry about I mean not worry about but
43:11
be careful about concerned about so you don't need to you don't need to then
43:17
take on weights that you're not meant to carry pray for the person make sure you
43:22
inst if God's calling to pray for someone um if that's in your territory or domain
43:28
and then make sure you tell them the importance of surrendering their whole lives to Jesus
43:36
and tell them The Importance of Being planted you can then then it's wise to suggest to them your church where you
43:42
are planted and share with them how your life has been changed how you've been
43:47
delivered and stayed delivered because you plant you've surrendered to God and you planted yourself there and you're
43:53
equipped there and there's covering there's spiritual protection there so you explained to them this is serious so
43:59
the demon left you but it wants to come back but you don't have to worry about it coming back as long as you surrender
44:06
to Jesus and be planted and be equipped um then then you don't need to
44:12
worry about it but you need to take this seriously so this is serious business don't worry but but have the fear of God
44:18
this is serious business so explain to that that to them so they don't think oh cool I got my fix like going to the
44:25
doctor I can just keep living my life how I want now you know know it's very serious it's very important you you
44:30
share this with them and it's also important you share I have um like for those of you who who who are planted at
44:37
5f it's very important for all of you to share the message this that I have a playlist on my YouTube channel how to
44:43
receive and maintain complete deliverance it's very important you share that with them because they might need more layers of Deliverance they
44:49
need to be equipped on what the different keys are that can unlock their complete deliverance number two they need to be equipped of how to maintain
44:55
your your deliverance you will not how to know you will not know how to maintain your deliverance without being equipped it's the the maintaining your
45:02
deliverance teachings I have really go deep reveal many schemes of the devil to
45:10
come and try to take your your deliverance so you cannot just think you're going to maintain your deliverance by not taking this seriously
45:17
by not being equipped by not listening to these teachings such as the ones that I have so make sure you share that with
45:24
them sh give them the links say this is very important you watch these and not just watch them but do them do what they
45:30
are saying what God's saying through these messages and beyond that you do
45:35
not need to worry think nothing no waight you've done your job you've done
45:40
your work now let God do the rest and you can't control it someone can decide
45:47
that they don't want to surrender to God but that's not your fault God called you to pray for them God called you to cast
45:52
a demon out of them it's not your weight to carry your burden to carry we are called to be obedient and do what God
45:59
has said to do to heal the sick but sometimes it may be time for a person to go to heaven it might just be God's
46:06
timing and it maybe they're not really old in age but it's just their timing but we're still so called to do what God
46:13
says so don't take the weight on yourself um just do that you're not
46:19
supposed to take the weight just do what God has called you to do and and and
46:26
rest and let God take care of the rest how do you know if you're in a test or God is drying something up to get you to
46:33
go somewhere else especially pertaining to location job School House Etc so it
God will shut a door
46:42
is true that sometimes God will shut a door to open up a Better Door so it's
46:49
important for you to always understand that um in life so not sometimes we're
46:55
like like so devastated how could God allow this to happen um I can't believe
47:02
what this is I can't believe the devil did this this is awful what has happened
47:08
to me when actually it was God closing the door to give you something better to
47:15
elevate you to lift you to promote you that's what it can be sometimes so
47:21
it's just first of all important just to have that understanding to not forget that truth okay um and to answer this
47:30
question there is not just one answer I can give you because it depends it
47:35
really depends it's going to be the leading of the Holy Spirit the important thing is for you to surrender everything
47:42
to him and to be aware of any like selfish Desires in there in the
47:48
heart and give them to God surrender everything and just pray to God Lord I
47:56
want to be in your will I want to be in your perfect will and so I thank you Lord for closing all the wrong doors and
48:02
opening up the right ones Lead Me Lord to be in your perfect will and
48:10
and so then holy spirit will start to speak to you he will lead you he will maybe
48:17
you will feel this you'll feel like to look for something else to look for a
48:23
new job for example if if it feels like the door is closing at this certain job
48:29
or something maybe it's you know there's struggle you may feel Holy Spirit
48:34
convicting you just go look just go look and he will start to lead you in that
48:40
way if that's what he wants you to do um and then when the time comes is
48:47
like the do just sometimes the do is almost shut completely and then there's
48:52
this favor there's this new thing this new new open door God will really speak
48:58
through that and and convict you oh this is what he's doing he's shutting this door and he's opening up this door so
49:06
that being said there can be there can be times of not quite certainty but holy
49:12
spirit is leading you he's leading you to look but you don't know for sure if
49:18
you know he's absolutely calling this season to end and go someplace new you don't know yet but you feel he's calling
49:24
you to look and so that's okay to be in that place of not complete certainty yet
49:30
that's somehow sometimes how God will lead in his still Small Voice and um he will eventually make
49:37
things clear if they are not clear so really the important thing is surrender
49:43
and to make sure you're never being like lazy right like if if you don't feel
49:50
like looking for something new whether this is a house or a job or whatever um
49:57
be sensitive to that no no oh I'm holding myself back here so just be
50:04
obedient just be open to the new and God will be clear as as time goes by in Your
50:12
Surrender whether this is a door that he's going to shut or this is a place to fight for and that God will bring you
50:19
victory in but it's a an a test of the it's a attack of the enemy and a test he
50:24
will reveal that as time go goes on just be surrendered and obedient and patient
50:30
with God's timing with when he reveals it all is it possible that God's calling
Is God calling me to work as a gardener
50:35
me to work as a gardener right now but actually that's not my calling and but
50:40
he's using it to refine me absolutely absolutely absolutely so I mean I
50:49
was when I graduated college I
50:55
was trying to figure out what God wanted what my calling was what God wanted me to do what my purpose was and I didn't
51:01
know I went to college not really knowing what I wanted to do what I mean what my calling was and my biggest
51:09
passion was singing and acting and I kind of was like well I shouldn't go to college for that like I should probably
51:15
go for something like more practical like you know I didn't really feel like I wanted to be on Broadway so long story
51:24
short I went to school for Communications it was a very broad major you could do a lot of things with it and I got this idea of maybe event planning
51:30
maybe I would like that but there was no certainty there so I went for four years kind of thinking I think I'll be an
51:36
event planner but really I didn't have certainty and then my last class of um I
51:43
mean the last semester I took an acting class for the very first time and I loved it it was the only class that I
51:50
actually enjoyed in college like like I looked forward to going to and I was like oh that must mean something I asked
51:56
my acting teacher she was like yes you have a talent you should pursue that and
52:01
so long story short there was other series of events where I felt God was calling me to LA to pursue acting so I
52:08
came out to LA to pursue acting and um then as I pursued acting for about a
52:13
year and a half I realized that I really didn't have as much passion for it as other people did in my field in that
52:19
field and at the same time God was bringing me closer to him closer to surrender and that he started putting
52:26
Ministry in my heart I didn't call it Ministry but what I mean is he started putting in my heart doing something
52:33
really more intentionally for him um so
52:39
what I mean is I got this idea to to be Christian Pop EDM singer songwriter as
52:45
singing was really my biggest biggest passion God and then singing um and so I stepped away pretty
52:53
much from acting and then focused on the music and um these things weren't my
52:59
calling but I do believe that um Holy Spirit was was um working with me with
53:07
what was in my heart in that season it wasn't quite time to speak vividly to me
53:13
your calling is to be an apostle it wasn't time it wasn't time for God to do that and we were made in His image and
53:22
um in terms of jobs he wants us to go after the passions he puts in our hearts and he will move through that and
53:31
will use you through that so I believe these passions that I had God was using that he knew I needed to get to La and
53:37
so he just used that to not for it to be like this is your calling but God was using it as an in between time um as a
God used my passions to get me to LA
53:46
preparation time refining me getting me um I I became so much closer to God throughout that whole journey of leaving
53:55
everything behind my family my friends and traveling across the country by myself with just Jesus uh I just grew so
54:02
much closer to him through that and just finding an apartment when I didn't know anyone in LA and um finding a job I was
54:12
a waitress at first and just that journey of trusting him um when I was like by myself I grew so much closer to
54:19
him through all of that and it was just looking back it was like day by day I was moving closer and closer to complete
54:25
surrender to God by getting to know his love more and God worked through all
54:31
those different things all those different passions and job Pursuits God was moving through all of that and also
54:38
I was planting seeds God used me to plant seeds and touch other people with
54:43
his love through the different through the acting through the music through then then waitressing so I was
54:49
waitressing I was a hostess I waitressed at um like two different
54:55
restaurants um I did I I I I was on a couple
55:02
commercials nothing like big um I was a a back background actor like extra an
55:09
extra in some things I did lift driving I was a lift
55:15
driver I did Postmates um this is all when I was in
55:20
LA um over the like 10 years ago N9 years ago 8 years ago um I was a brand
55:29
ambassador for a time I did so many different things so many different jobs
55:35
and all the while I was in relationship with God all the while I was seeking what is my purpose lord it's not like I
55:41
was just like doing whatever I wanted like my heart was after God in all of
55:47
those jobs and Pursuits and um eventually I was a nanny and I nannied
55:52
for several different children and um I don't know if I'm missing anything I
55:57
assisted a wedding planner before too I did so many different jobs and that was all while I was following God and so I
56:05
say all that to say of like that's part of our Lives is just different jobs and
56:11
God using it in different areas and to not get hung up on the fact like am I in
56:16
my purpose in this job I wanted to be like in my purpose
56:22
back when I was aged like 2 too I really wanted that but in terms of like the
56:28
fullness of my calling my purpose as an apostle as a
56:33
minister um that didn't happen for several years later from when I was
56:41
really Desiring this and pursuing this and seeking God for this but none of that time was wasted none of that time
56:47
was wasted at all God use it all to bring me closer to him and also using me
56:53
as a vessel through those times planting seeds of his love in people through all those different jobs so I say that to
57:01
say don't ever feel discouraged if you're in a job where you're not like
57:07
super passionate about it and you don't feel like it's your your true calling and purpose like don't feel ansy and
57:14
down about it know that this is just part of our journey with God he doesn't
57:20
give us the fullness of our purpose calling career whatever exactly when we want it we got
57:28
to be patient and content with that and just be obedient and be grateful for where we're at and what God's doing how
57:35
he's using us where we're at at the job we're at and know that when you're obedient God will release more to you
57:43
when I was ministering for almost yeah for like more than a year
57:50
for more than a year I I I think I think it's about a year
57:55
I was nannying I was naning every single day as I was leading the church you know
58:02
I I didn't want to be doing that and I didn't want to be nannying while leading the church and it felt like God you gave
58:09
me these huge prophecies these huge prophecies these huge promises like I
58:16
totally knew all that was coming from the prophecies back then and I'm like
58:22
but I have to Nanny and I'm not able to spend much time on the ministry and I
58:28
wasn't totally in that place you know totally in that place but God wanted me
58:33
there to Humble me to refine me more through nanning wow ministering and
58:40
everything and um and refine me in that area of um not having much money and
58:48
working hard and making sacrifice and just being content and grateful with
58:53
what God had bless me with and given me amen there's a special Grace
59:03

59:11
there's a special Grace upon you um and all who are in your
59:17
situation granted if you if you feel God calling you if you feel this passion that you want to

1:00:04
season where I just for so long I mean I was really my parents were helping me fin were helping me financially for a
1:00:11
long time because I was pursuing acting and music part-time and then would have a part-time job and living in La is
1:00:18
really quite expensive like the apartments at least you know I mean I was sharing a room at one time for years
1:00:26
and so my parents were so gracious to support me so I was in a place of having
1:00:31
hardly anything any money to to even
1:00:36
like se you know for a long time and I would just wanted to sew I had a heart I
1:00:42
wanted to sew I wanted to sew hugely into God's kingdom I wanted to I wanted
1:00:47
to sew to my spiritual father who I'd received so much from I want I wanted to sew I wanted to to I understood the
1:00:53
power of sewing I really wanted to sew and I I couldn't give big amounts
1:00:59
because that but that it was the season God had me and God specifically wanted
1:01:05
to refine Me by not having much money at that time you know
1:01:10
but the God God sees you tests you in that season if you'll be faithful with
1:01:16
what you have and and it's just a season God will bless you in another season and
1:01:21
you will be able to the harsh desire you had you'll be able to will will be
1:01:27
fulfilled amen so um if you're in that season of stretching don't be
1:01:34
discouraged and don't think like you're missing out because you don't have enough money to sew into the kingdom or
1:01:40
something like that don't be discouraged don't think like that but what also is important is to make sure you're not
1:01:46
being like lazy like make sure you are doing your part to um work to get a job
1:01:55
you know um and so you can do all that God wants you to do so you
1:02:00
can have seed so God can put seed in your hand position yourself so God can put seed in your hand and at the same on
1:02:08
the same regard um don't be lazy about searching for something that provides
1:02:14
more like maybe you know your your job doesn't give much money but you know
1:02:19
deep down you could find something that would that would bring more to cover
1:02:25
bills that are hardly being covered and it's causing so much stress to you and you're not able to to sew or contribute
1:02:32
to the kingdom of God as well you know make sure you're not being lazy in that area that make sure you're you're doing
1:02:39
your part to position yourself to receive the seed from God that he wants to give to
