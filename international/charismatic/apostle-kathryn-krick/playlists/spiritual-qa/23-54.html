0:00
when should we publicly repent and should we ask that of other people when they've sinned against
0:07
us um so first of
0:14
all renouncing and repenting are similar but
0:20
different so in the book of Acts it says that they were they were confessing
0:26
their sins publicly um and in the book of Acts In this passage where it says that it's
0:33
it's also speaking of Revival breaking out and many miracles happening um and
0:38
so in this time there was definitely renouncing happening so many times
0:43
repenting and renouncing are this are happening at the same time um some many
0:49
times a key to be set free is to renounce which is to speak aloud to confess aloud I do not want this sin in
0:57
my life anymore this oppression um I do not want this I renounce it uh
1:06
and so you know that's that's two things in ones repenting and renouncing and
1:11
renouncing is important for everyone for every person if they have demonic bondage of any kind does it have to be
1:19
public though the renouncing no um but many times it is a key that unlocks your
1:24
freedom to renounce where the anointing is being released so
1:31
that's why many times I'll ask people do you want to renounce something it's because God is revealing to me in that
1:38
moment renouncing right now where the anointing is is a key that's unlocking
1:45
there this person's freedom and sometimes when um maybe a
1:51
person has had Pride uh that it would be important to not you know say no I don't
1:59
want to speak this publicly um it would be a key for one to be set free to be
2:05
obedient and speak aloud uh in front of everyone but that's
2:11
just sometimes it's not a situation where it's like people should March to the front of
2:16
the church and interrupt the service and say excuse me I need to say this publicly or else I won't be free no no
2:24
no that's more of a case-by case situation like if the minister the anointed servant of God says
2:30
do you want to renounce something and and and in that case it's important for
2:35
that person to speak to speak aloud and in front of
2:40
people sometimes um so that's renouncing um so many times people are
2:47
watching they're watching live and they're not in front of anybody they're renouncing and they're being set free it
2:53
doesn't have to be public but what's really important is the testifying
2:59
public that's a big part of maintaining your freedom that's a big part of obedience to God it's a big part of
3:06
being in God's will so that's a big part of more grace coming upon your life the
3:12
more you are in God's will the more you are accessing God's
3:18
grace the more you are allowing God to come in power and release blessings and
3:26
miracles and Abundant Life to you Hallelujah um okay so that is what I
3:33
that's I want to I want to speak about repenting in regards to renouncing how they're
3:38
similar and just repent like the public part of it so now I want to talk about
3:45
um when you should when you should publicly repent if you've sinned against another person so this public repenting
3:54
should happen if you have if you have spoken against a person
4:01
wrongly if you have falsely accused them wrongly um publicly you you should be you need to
4:08
make this right and we see so most of this most of the time we see this is
4:14
people talking against Servants of God publicly and they're so they're speaking
4:21
false many of them are speaking false accusations they're straight up making up things they are um taking things out
4:27
of context they are um seeing things and not understanding them they're seeing
4:33
honor and they're calling it something that it's not they're calling it worship many times and the Bible says that in
4:40
the last days people call what's good they will call evil and what's evil good
4:45
and literally that that is what is happening when people are genuinely coming this happens to me so much this
4:50
has happened to people at 5f for honoring for doing nothing but honoring honoring Servants of God um I've seen so
4:59
much attack come towards me and others um for honoring and so like how I've
5:07
honored my spiritual father in a way that people don't understand they they they they don't understand the the
5:12
culture especially in Africa of how they honor um and and so I've gone the done
5:21
the African culture way because that would be the most honoring way if I'm
5:26
going to if I'm going to honor a servant of God who is African then the most
5:32
honoring thing to do would be to honor in that culture right because that's how
5:38
we that's how like like even if you receive Love Like It's Your Love Like Love language in a way like if you're in
5:45
America and the thing to do is to hug someone when you really want to show
5:50
gratitude to them or something but that's not your culture you would hug them so that they can really receive
5:57
that love for example anyways so um people many times I've seen have called
6:04
what's good evil and they'll say what is honoring they'll say is evil they'll say
6:09
it's worship when it was nothing but a pure good heart and in obedience to God as he calls us to give honor where honor
6:16
is due uh and so anyways that's that's what
6:21
we see with these many people speaking against Servants of God we see them twisting twisting the truth and call and
6:30
making up these lies or and and and sometimes just wrongly um
6:37
interpreting uh uh what a servant of God is doing or how they are like a servant of God is is is flowing in the new wine
6:45
and someone is in the old wine and does not have this Revelation and so just
6:51
like the Pharisees called what Jesus was doing was wrong and and and unbiblical
6:56
that's what people do today okay so when people are doing this when people are
7:01
making exposed videos when people are making posts and they are speaking all of these
7:08
wrong things it is doing damage I mean it is leading people astray it is people
7:15
are believing lies um and that's really serious in the kingdom of God because that means people
7:22
are being led away from the truth and where God had called them to receive from so um
7:30
it is 100% 100% important um necessary God's will to
7:38
publicly repent to publicly apologize and repent and say I was
7:44
wrong I was wrong you know these these were lies I spoke or
7:51
um I had I I I I misjudged I
7:57
misjudged I I was seeing something I was twisting it in my
8:02
mind I was hearing from the angel of Light whatever you need they need these people
8:08
need to do this publicly that's the only way they are
8:13
truly repenting and that's the only way that they are receiving Grace from God
8:20
to be redeemed otherwise they're going to be keeping on
8:25
reaping what they've SED so it is 100% not good enough to just repent to God
8:32
and apologize to God and privately repent and apologize um to the person
8:37
you wronged when you have publicly caused damage um and uh a lot of people
8:45
aren't doing this because this requires humility this requires you to say I was
8:51
wrong um and so it's rare that you see this it's rare and the sad thing is is
8:56
that when people won't do this if they're they're reaping still they're they're reaping what they've sowed that
9:03
it's not considered true repentance um they've caused so much damage in the kingdom and they've left
9:11
that damage they've done nothing to repair that damage so that's when it
9:16
should be done um publicly when when you or a person has um hurt someone's image
9:24
wrongly someone's P perception um falsely accused
9:29
is being stronger than your beginning referring to when you first fell in fiery love with Jesus or when one first came to a church where God's power was
9:36
such as first coming and serving God or both it means many things it means uh by
9:41
the way if the past if you weren't at church the past two Sundays this is what
9:46
this question is referring to as the title was called stronger than your beginning so um it means both what it
9:53
means different things for for everybody so um it it just means is
10:00
like it can be even like a if you know your purpose or your a dream God's given
10:07
you and you've started serving him in this it can mean that as well um it
10:13
could even mean um even like if you were excited to go to school and you know
10:22
um you you believe God is calling you to this career and you went to you started
10:27
going to college and at first you were excited and um excited about your future and maybe you got some bad grades and
10:34
you failed some tests and now you're like feeling like giving up like it also means that it means so
10:41
many different aspects of just areas where God is calling you
10:48
to do something for him Thrive and serve him and so it also
10:56
applies of course to your relationship with Jesus it's it's different for everybody but it's many
11:01
things how do you know when the refining Fire season is over well it's different for everybody
11:08
um but we are transforming more into the image of God every day we're not supposed to have
11:16
reached a destination until we go be with Jesus in heaven um so that means I
11:23
mean the refining is what changes us is what transforms us so that means that it will be
11:29
continual um you know like it it's going to look different for everybody the the
11:35
but but but but for most people it's going to look like Seasons more than one
11:40
season and different things and some refining fire will be more difficult than
11:46
others um some refining fire will be more challenging than others um you know
11:52
for me personally I had such a Wilderness time time where
11:59
that was my biggest refining fire and that was in the area of
12:05
waiting number one and number two persecution and number three
12:13
um circumstances like feeling like I was going backwards as the church got
12:19
smaller and smaller with every year and also financially those circumstances
12:24
like not having much money um so and of course doing something so out of
12:31
my comfort zone uh preaching and ministering so for me that was my big
12:37
refining fire my biggest refining fire um but then I would say like personally
12:44
for me um then once the beginning of the
12:49
promised land came you know there's Giants in the promised land so it's like the walls Came Crashing
12:55
Down and it was so exciting to enter the promised land but then I found Giants and they were different than what I'd
13:02
encountered before and they were bigger um and some of the the the this this
13:08
became a refining fire for me persecution and that happened within um I mean right away pretty much of just a
13:15
few months into entering the promised land and those giants kept being there
13:20
it wasn't just one day one week one month of a giant of persecution but it
13:26
was ongoing and and it would increase actually the first that that first
13:33
year and um so that was more refining fire even
13:39
though I just entered the promised land it wasn't like I had arrived uh and then um ever since then
13:47
there's been such season even for me personally of um waiting waiting refined
13:53
refining fire um waiting on the Promises to come um
14:00
waiting waiting the waiting I think is one of the biggest I believe is one of the biggest refining fires and many
14:07
times we're waiting for for years so it's refining fire is part of our
14:13
life and it's it's different seasons but the great part of it is that
14:20
we are always being transformed more into Jesus's image more to be more like Jesus with every season of refining fire
14:29
that we go through and God knows just what he needs to do for us do to us in
14:35
that fire to help us be more like him to stretch our faith
14:41
hallelujah how do you manage your time to work and rest being very
14:49
intentional like in this life of busyness like never before that I'm in
14:54
especially with the flourish conferences of ministering so many times within two days and getting back for church on
15:00
Sundays and traveling internationally um I'm I'm being I have to be more intentional than ever before
15:07
in my entire life like very intentional like um really plan out the hours of the
15:15
day and plan out make sure I'm getting to sleep I'm going to bed at the right time
15:21
so I can be taking care of my body so that my body is functioning it's not getting sick it's strong to do the work
15:30
that God has called me to do and also being intentional to set aside time set
15:36
aside time to rest set aside time to not work and just relax and
15:43
enjoy life enjoy God's creation you know
15:48
and really just be intentional with that and and know that it's so important rather than just like going with the
15:55
flow and just not paying attention to the time or not paying attention um to
16:01
the calendar but just being so intentional um that's it's really like a
16:07
practical thing a WI a wise thing that I have to do um yeah to to to be just
16:17
intentional because otherwise I could end up getting in trouble I could end up um realizing oh no there's there's not
16:26
enough hours to sleep and you you know and find repercussions from that do you
16:33
ever get irritated or annoyed at people or circumstances how do you stay cheerful and loving all the time even
16:39
when people trigger you
16:45
uh well I would say Renewing Your Mind
16:50
Renewing Your Mind to these truths number one of number one being
16:59
that you I have to protect my peace you have to protect your peace like this
17:04
should be something that we're doing all of the time like we're thinking about it we're not forgetting that we have to
17:11
protect our peace and that so so so protecting your peace also
17:18
includes Renewing Your Mind to be aware of the enemy schemes to be aware that
17:24
the devil is after your peace um especially when you have doors shut and
17:31
you're serious about serving God you know it's all the devil has I mean it's
17:36
all the devil can try to do like you are protected you are if you
17:41
are planted where the anointing is you have the spiritual covering you are so
17:47
protected Hallelujah you are so protected and when you have doors shut
17:53
and you're surrendered to God no demons can come in and there can't be be any
17:59
attacks unless God allows it like how he allowed with job in a purpose of
18:04
refining you um but you know the the the time of job wasn't his whole I mean the
18:11
time when job was being attacked by the devil when God allowed it wasn't his whole life it was just for a time so
18:18
normally when you are surrendered to God and you are protected and
18:26
um and also when you're being mature to to to to move forward to maintain your
18:33
deliverance to not let the devil fool you with lies and make you think like
18:38
you're still in bondage or you're constantly At War With the Devil once you're mature and walking in
18:46
Victory the devil doesn't have anything but to try to take your peace he doesn't have
18:53
anything so um the the the biggest the big way the
18:59
enemy will try to come and take your pieces through other people that's one of the big reasons why it's important
19:04
that you have boundaries and you don't just allow anyone close in your life because they can constantly be a vessel
19:10
of the enemy to bring attack and disturb you and try and stealing your peace right but um
19:19
there will be times when you can't avoid interacting with people that aren't
19:24
surrendered to God are fleshly especially in the workplace and some sometimes where you live sometimes among
19:30
with among family members um and just anywhere anywhere
19:36
where you're around people it can be even at church when people aren't not
19:41
everyone's on the same spiritual level there's Babies among uh the mature and
19:48
there are not surrendered people among the surrendered and we welcome everybody we want everyone to encounter Jesus and
19:56
keeping on encountering Jesus until they can hopefully choose make their own
20:01
decision to give everything to Jesus and surrender so that they can then be transformed and mature amen um but
20:09
anyways so when you are in those circumstances when you're around people
20:14
um because God doesn't call us to just be isolated you're going to be around people where the enemy will try to work
20:20
through and try to uh steal your peace so the biggest thing is to just be
20:26
aware of this when a person's ear iritating you um buking you uh you have
20:32
to remember oh the most important thing right now is I is I protect my
20:38
peace the devil wants me to get all upset and bothered and angry at at this
20:45
that's what he wants that that is what he wants that is the main thing behind what's going on
20:51
here so you got to be spiritually sharp Renewing Your
20:57
Mind Renewing Your Mind always in the spirit so someone is bugging you you
21:03
immediately go in the spirit you don't let you don't let what they're doing
21:08
anger you frustrate you you you stop first go in the spirit when you're sensing this coming you go in the spirit
21:16
you renew your mind you know the devil wants me to get all bothered in this but
21:22
there's no need to be bothered like God is in control God has this I trust him
21:29
and everything will be fine and this just seems more frustrating and like a
21:36
bigger deal than it really is right now it because it's the enemy trying to take my peace you renew your mind with this
21:45
and you reject all lies of the devil you know that are coming to try to make you
21:50
angry frustrated and you set your mind on whatever is true worthy of Praise
21:58
admirable lovely um you the devil wants you to be he wants to take your peace and distract
22:04
you that's one of the biggest things he's trying to do daily and one of the biggest things he's doing through people
22:10
daily is to take your peace and distract you every day we should
22:15
be focused on Jesus and focused on everything about Jesus which is peace
22:23
and joy and life and hope and victory and his precious work and we should be
22:30
focused on doing the work of God that's where our focus should be every day so
22:36
every time we're looking away from that we are being angry being frustr
22:42
frustrated we are letting our mind go for a while or talk about how frustrated
22:48
we are what this whatever we are taking our
22:53
Focus off of where it's supposed to be so that's that's how you can overcome is
23:01
being sharp in the spirit Renewing Your Mind and being wise to know the enemy schemes
23:07
and not let him win my daughter received freedom from anxiety at revivals of Chicago what
23:13
wisdom do you have for me to help her maintain her Freedom she is seven years old praise God
23:21
hallelujah thank you Jesus so I even though she's only seven
23:26
I will share what I share with everyone and how how you can maintain your freedom is um taking maintaining your
23:34
freedom seriously the best way to take it seriously is by really being a disciple a disciple of Jesus a disciple
23:42
where where you've received that freedom from um so I have these messages on my
23:49
YouTube It's a four-part forart uh S four-part series of how to maintain your
23:55
deliverance so it's like four or more hours hours or so of this very important
24:00
teaching and it's meaty and it's in depth and it just goes over all these sneaky strategies of the enemy to try to
24:07
take your freedom so um watch those with her I know she's only seven I believe
24:13
that she will at least be listening some of the time if not all the time and
24:19
also for you to be really equipped in this then you can break it down and share it to her share it with her in um
24:27
you know language that she understands little by little it's a 4-Hour teaching and so since she's young
24:34
you can you can spend weeks and months giving it to her piece by
24:42
piece um and so that's my that's my advice for you it's on my
24:48
YouTube the big oh the biggest thing I will share though if since this is anxiety she was free of um free from is
24:55
to teach her about rejecting the enemy's lies that she was in bondage before
25:01
where she couldn't control her um the anxiety it would like take over she
25:07
couldn't control it but now that's gone that demonic oppression inside her is
25:13
gone so now if ever she's ever to feel fear any time again she needs to know
25:20
that it's different from before now it's just the devil line and she has authority to reject the devil so
25:28
she just has to say I reject every lie of fear and anxiety Jesus has set me
25:35
free thank you Jesus for freeing me I declare that I have peace I have sound
25:41
mind and there's nothing to fear because Jesus is with me
25:47
Hallelujah can you expand on how to practically renew your mind daily this is a good one um so the Bible
25:57
says renew your mind with the word of God be transformed by Renewing Your Mind with the word of God
26:05
so just being in the word every day is important because you're you're you it's
26:12
cleansing you as I shared in that message I shared in this message um what was the name of the word of the
26:22
message I spoke a whole message on how to renew your mind it was with the glass of water so I
26:30
think that message was really teaching how to renew your mind um the big part
26:36
of it is filling your filling yourself with the word filling yourself with the word because everything else from the
26:42
world is like in your mind dirty dirty and so you you read the word and water
26:48
comes water comes and washes away the impurities um and then so so but but
26:56
also you have to do your job throughout the day like maybe when you're in a situation where you can't um
27:02
break out the Bible as well but just in every situation um you should be remembering meditating on the word of
27:08
God um and so like if there's a certain struggle you
27:15
have a certain area of struggle you have find that
27:20
scripture find the truth and Rama word too that I'm speaking now like the Rama
27:25
word I just spoke about when you're being frustrated when the devil's trying to steal your peace what to do so I just
27:31
shared a r a word so like if that's you if you're finding that your peace is
27:37
being taken so much and or you're struggling with being frustrated with people people bothering you
27:45
um take this Rama word like listen to it again and again write it down what I
27:51
said because it's what I what I'm sharing is bringing Revelation from the word of God so of the word of God is um
28:00
you will keep in perfect peace you will keep in perfect peace those whose eyes are fixed on
28:06
you and another scripture I'm giving Revelation on in this subject without
28:12
even saying the scriptures but I I'm just sharing with you like what's happening so another one is um is
28:22
uh the Devil comes to steal kill and destroy so being aware the devil's
28:27
coming to to try to steal my peace another scripture I exes giving Revelation on is guard your heart from
28:34
everything flows from it above all else guard your
28:41
heart that's the Revelation I'm giving you you're not going to be able to do the work of God and be in the
28:46
relationship with God that pleases God the most and being full of his full of
28:53
him the most full of his peace and joy the most when you're distracted when you're not in your
29:00
heart um resist the devil submit to God resist the devil and he must flee resist
29:05
those attacks of the enemy uh the Devil is a father of
29:10
Lies um the devil is roaring around like a lion seeking whom he can
29:17
devour uh and also when Jesus says to Peter get me get
29:24
behind me Satan that's showing in the scripture that God uh the devil can work through people
29:31
even people we wouldn't expect to try to distract us to try to steal our peace to try to take us away from God's will
29:38
right so I just gave you a bunch of scriptures right now and all of those scriptures it's like all the scriptures
29:45
put together is what is what that revelation of the Rama word I gave you was based
29:51
upon right so the Rama word is very important to be renewing your mind with so all these scriptures I didn't say the
29:58
scripture names but you can Google them after this you can search guard your heart from from Above All Else scripture
30:06
and it'll give you the exact scripture so you can find it so all the scriptures I just mentioned you can just type those up to find the exact scriptures and like
30:14
like for example if this is what you're struggling with protecting your peace being frustrated with people you should
30:21
you should take down the notes of what I wrote of what I I'm sorry what I spoke Rama word my direction
30:28
and you should also write down the scripture and then you should meditate on these so every day you're reading the
30:35
scriptures speaking the scriptures aloud um and and and re and and reading
30:41
and speaking aloud what I shared the the teaching the Revelation from this all
30:47
right so that's how you renew your mind and then and then and then when you get that in you so much it'll be like
30:53
memorized in you so then a situation comes and you can do like what I'm doing right now I I I don't have to go to a
31:00
paper right now but I can quickly it's in me the word's in me um so I can bring
31:07
it to my mind right there so when you get that in you situations in life come
