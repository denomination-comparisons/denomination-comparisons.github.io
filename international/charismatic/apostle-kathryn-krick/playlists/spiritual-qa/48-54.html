0:00
all the shopping malls are selling Halloween things how can I buy things from those shops and what to pray after
0:06
coming out from the shop you're protected um we live in this world and
0:12
you know it's not we we we can't live it's it's not realistic to live in this world and only
0:19
go to Christian owned shops and restaurants and make sure that they're
0:25
truly Christian because a lot of Christians end up being used by the devil for example Pharisees of today so
0:31
just because someone says this is a Christian shop a Christian owned shop or business doesn't mean much you know I
0:38
mean it just because someone declares that says that you don't know if they really are surrendered if they are
0:44
opening up doors if they are undercover for the devil being a Pharisee right so
0:50
um but anyways it's just not realistic for us to only go to christian-owned shops and stores and uh and restaurants
0:57
um actually we are called to be the Salt and Light of the the Earth and so if we stay confined like if we only go out in
1:04
public only in a bubble of you know Christian Christian Society bubble how
1:11
can we reach the lost you know so because God has put us on this Earth and he's called us to be the salt and the
1:17
light he also is protecting us um when we go to get things that we need to
1:23
survive uh it's restaurants and stores we are protected and it doesn't matter
1:30
if the people owning this businesses or working there aren't surrendered to
1:35
Jesus it doesn't have an effect on us we are protected um where we are not
1:41
protected is when we open doors personally to these people letting them
1:47
close in our lives or when we open up doors to to buy things that are demonic
1:53
like dark demonic objects Halloween things that are dark and demonic um
1:59
crystals from an actual like um shop that they're saying
2:07
that they're selling these crystals to give to help you have find healing or
2:12
luck or whatever but crystals are made from God um crystals Stones they they're
2:20
created by God and so there's nothing wrong with buying Crystals and Stones in general but it's just that um there are
2:27
new age practices where people um believe believe that healing or luck
2:34
will come from the stone rather than Jesus and so they've made it a a
2:41
witchcraft practice by believing these things um and and so if you go into a
2:48
store that is saying get this um Stone so you can have healing um I I wouldn't
2:56
get that granted if if it if it if it says oh it can provide healing and
3:02
you're getting it just as a decoration but not to believe in healing you're okay but it's just kind of walking with
3:07
the Holy Spirit like if I want to buy a crystal just for the you know to see
3:13
God's creation in my home beauty or something um I'm probably wanting to I'm
3:18
going to want to buy it in like a in a neutral way I would ra I would prefer to buy if that's what I want to do I would
3:25
want to buy a crystal where it's not saying this is
3:30
for healing or whatever but rather just you know a
3:35
neutral just a crystal you know so um
3:41
yeah so that's just kind of a summary of uh Direction in terms of like we don't
3:46
need to be afraid or worried to buy um things I mean you know Walmart Target
3:55
Costco all of the like big Stores um where we where where most people get
4:01
things like toothpaste and and groceries and you know just basic things they're
4:08
going to sell Halloween stuff but that's not going to harm you um because it h
4:14
they happen to sell Halloween stuff in the same store you're protected you're protected by the blood
4:21
of Jesus you're protected um by the covering of where you of where you are planted the
4:27
anointing there is covering you question about Facebook I want to delete
4:33
it based on how much it was of my old life I deleted and instantly reactivated it because of the testimonies that I
4:39
shared on your page is it wrong to delete and restart it's not wrong to delete and
4:47
restart um however if you have a bunch of followers and friends that are safe
4:54
to keep in terms of you know they're not constantly messaging you
5:00
um you know going against boundaries you've put up with certain relationships but let's say they're just I mean how
5:06
Facebook kind of works is and I know how my Facebook it's like all these different spheres of life I've been in
5:13
from high school to college to um study abroad program to um different Christian
5:20
circles in La when I first moved here 10 years ago um there's just like friends
5:26
Facebook friends on there from all that time you know just there and um I know
5:33
that major seeds are being planted even in all in different people amongst you
5:40
know all of those hundreds and hundreds thousands something of people um even if
5:45
they don't like or comment or tell me I know seeds are being planted by what I
5:50
share by what I post by by me being the light of the world as Jesus calls us to
5:56
be the light of the world shining his light through us so um in these days
6:01
social media is one of the most important platforms that we have just
6:07
because it reaches so many people um it it reaches so many and
6:12
there's so much that can be done through seeds as the scripture says some plant the seeds some water the seeds or or
6:20
some uh and God makes it makes it to grow and then Harvest comes so planting
6:26
the seeds is such a big part of our our duty our job there is so much fruit and
6:33
harvest and salvation and healing and freedom that comes directly from the seeds we planted and when you plant the
6:39
seeds it's when you see them go in the ground and then you don't see them again so there's usually not so much um you
6:46
know physical evidence really that you've done much when you plant seeds but wow really we are doing so much when
6:54
we plant seeds for God uh the big way of planting seeds is is is sharing
7:00
spreading the good news on our social media as the big one um sharing videos
7:06
sharing testimonies because God is working through us God is working through your testimony his power is
7:12
working through you God is working through the videos you share the posts you share like from your church like
7:18
from fivefold church from all the Miracles and testimonies and preaching moments God's power is moving through it
7:24
so we're stewards to to let God move right like we share and it it's like
7:32
God's power is moving through these videos these posts so mindly touching
7:38
people and we're not aware of it and usually they're not telling us but he is moving powerfully he is planting seeds
7:46
you never know um someone could be far from God not a Believer but they've
7:51
really struggled with anxiety or depression or suicidal thoughts or addiction and they just see one
7:56
testimony and they're like whoa what but there's a possibility that I could be
8:02
like free from this anxiety free from this depression free from the suicide thoughts free from this addiction who
8:08
and maybe that's all they do maybe they maybe you know they don't all of a sudden come to church but there's a
8:15
major seed planted and they can't stop thinking about it they can't stop thinking about it and it will lead later to a
8:21
harvest um so uh in ter so my advice my advice for
8:28
those of you that have such um like maybe a dark past you know
8:33
you want to like bury that past you don't want to be attached to that past at all my suggestion would be to go
8:40
through and delete posts um you don't
8:45
have to delete every single post you but just like the posts that are really not
8:51
a good representation of God it's always good also to make a testimony video or a
8:58
test testimony post and um sometimes you can even you can even share a picture
9:03
before and after because it's for the glory of God like whoa look at how much God has transformed them now you you
9:10
want to be mindful and wise with that like um if the vid if the picture is
9:16
very provocative maybe not use that one but maybe show another picture where you
9:21
can just tell you're not shining the Light of Christ as you are now to see the difference sometimes you can do that
9:28
you don't have to always do that the words are enough many times and just the the just sharing I used to be this way
9:35
and now I am this way is many times enough um so uh make make that testimony
9:43
post so that people in your past who used to see the old posts can understand
9:49
how this change came what happened why you look so different why your post
9:54
looks so different why your pictures look so different why everything is so different um so that's my advice go through with the
10:02
past posts and delete the ones that don't give glory to God if they're just like neutral posts you can leave it I
10:10
mean if it's many years back it's I mean it's just history it's history right uh
10:16
so so yeah that would be my advice so so that you can keep that platform still
10:23
that's a way to reach people those acquaintances those people that it's okay to have on your social media
10:28
because um they're not crossing boundaries and not messaging you um a lot which is
10:36
going against boundaries that God's called you to have for this person you know there's a lot of people like that on social media where they're just there
10:42
and what we need to see there is is that that these are souls these are souls that God wants to reach this is a
10:49
harvest field this is something God's entrusted us to he has given us a
10:54
platform even if it's 5 10 15 20 100 people 500 people people it is a
11:00
platform um to reach him for his glory so um that would be my advice rather
11:05
than starting fresh CU you might um lose a lot of people that God's calling you
11:11
to just be the light to how do you know whether a big dream
11:16
is from God or your own desires well the thing about God is that
11:22
many times he doesn't reveal things to us exactly when we want him to many times we want to know now the answer and
11:31
um many times God doesn't want to answer right then and there but he has a reason and purpose for answering you in his
11:40
time giving you Clarity and direction in his timing for example I um was
11:47
searching for my calling for so long searching for my purpose I was asking God I was including him I was praying to
11:54
him Lord I I want to be in your will um but this is before I was fully surrendered to God but I was wanting to
12:00
be in his will and I was praying um I wasn't just like I'm going after my
12:06
dream no I was including God I was inviting him in and I remember that was
12:11
in two thou that was uh 10 years ago which wasn't 13 and I remember just
12:16
having no clue I had just graduated college and I had this like Fe this
12:22
knowing in me that what I went to college for is not what God was calling me to do and that knowing really came
12:28
came like on graduation like the week of graduation and that knowing came then um
12:35
so then the next step was like so what should I do and um part of the reason why I um knew
12:43
God wasn't calling me to do what I went to college for which was Communications
12:48
and I was thinking I was going to go going to go into event planning but that was really just me searching for something to do cuz I didn't know what I
12:54
should do with my life and so that kind of you know just came such a strong
13:00
Revelation to me like this isn't your passion this isn't you don't really have strong gifts here and you don't feel a
13:07
pull from God you know to to pursue this once once
13:13
once graduation came and at the same time um I was really finding such a
13:19
passion for singing and acting at the same time so then I just started to pursue singing and acting um and so I I
13:28
I moved back to LA to pursue acting and
13:43
then should we delete our old lives like drinking and less modest pictures from
13:49
years in the past yes that's what I was sharing in the past so if the pictures don't glorify God yes delete them um
13:56
it's okay to to show maybe if if sometime years ago you were like at a
14:01
bar but like probably like I wouldn't like wouldn't leave a picture of you like chugging shots or something but if
14:08
you're sitting there like at a bar and there's a drink there I would say that is okay just walk with wisdom holy
14:14
spirit because it's showing if it's years back past it's showing the transformation um but you know just
14:22
follow the holy leading to the Holy Spirit what I'm what I'm saying is pictures that aren't glorifying to God
14:27
like you are do doing sinful acts um that are like provocative that could
14:34
lead people astray don't leave those but you don't have to delete everything you
14:39
can keep some to to show that you have changed that your life was different
14:45
than it was it's different than it used to be but just some that it's just some that are like PG I guess I should say
14:53
you know what I mean like if we're talking about a documentary of your life
14:58
um you wouldn't show the rated arm moments but you could still tell the story by keeping it
15:05
PG that through images and videos that's what I mean so back to what I was sharing before um this was for the last
15:13
question but the current question I was I was in before my the the camera
15:18
stopped um was how to know if your if a big dream is your desires or is God's
15:25
and so I was just sharing my testimony how I went to LA and
15:31
um I pursued acting but then a year later I just knew in my spirit really
15:36
this is not what God's calling me to I then felt God was calling me to at the time singing um but it wasn't the moment
15:43
that God had brought in like intense Clarity yet I thought it was it but um
15:49
you know it looking back it wasn't like I received this clear word but it was
15:56
just looking back that there were all these signs signs and confirmations but um because I had surrendered to God in
16:03
my heart there wasn't that definitive time of like this is what God has spoken
16:09
no I was humbled when I received the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle I was humbled to see oh I
16:15
thought this was God speaking that this was for sure my calling but actually
16:21
there has not been such a definitive moment as right now there is that I was called to be an apostle um
16:32
so uh so I just wanted to share my story with you so you can kind of see like how
16:38
God works many times I was praying to God 10 years
16:44
ago Lord I want to be in your will I want to do what you want for my life but
16:49
God waited until he could get me to that place of complete
16:55
surrender like about 2 years after I initially was praying Lord lead me into
17:01
what you your per my purpose is for my life your purpose for my life um right
17:08
after college but you know it was a couple years later until I actually surrendered everything to God and then
17:13
nine months after I surrendered everything to God God brought me that concrete clear Direction and answer this
17:21
is my your purpose on this Earth this is what this is my dream for you and what I
17:27
want you to do to be an apostle and to start a
17:32
church um so I it took a couple years for God to really answer that but that
17:38
was in his perfect timing looking back it was so beautiful because my relationship with him grew so
17:44
much my faith grew so much and most importantly my surrender came complete surrender came so that when he released
17:50
his dream for me even though my emotions didn't want it my spirit wanted it more than anything because God didn't want to
17:57
force me God didn't want me God wanted me to be like Mary Mary was like when
18:03
she received that word from the angel I am a servant of the Lord let it be done to me as you have said so she you can
18:09
see she has this joy to obey God you can see that she's not like oh wow my dreams
18:17
have come true this is exactly what I hoped would happen that um I I would I I
18:23
would have the Messiah in my womb conceived by the Holy Spirit you know no
18:29
it was like oh this is God's dream amen I'm a servant of the Lord let it be done
18:35
God wanted to get me to that place rather than making me feel forced
18:40
making me feel like a robot or something um that would lead to me probably being
18:48
bitter that would lead me to like constantly longing for my dreams but
18:54
when God got me to this perfect place of surrender and just that ripe place place of releasing with
19:01
Clarity this is your calling um it it was amazing because I was I
19:09
just wanted God's will more than anything so I was like yes Lord amen I just want your will I mean my feelings
19:15
weren't there completely but what I wanted more than anything was God's Will and so the beautiful thing is that I
19:22
never had any bitterness towards God I ne never never even when I did not public speaking was my biggest Fe
19:28
weakness and I had no desire to preach I had no desire to start a church my biggest passion was singing
19:35
and God was asking me to lay that down and I felt so weak and uncomfortable and
19:40
I felt like you know it's just it's just like exhilarating and comfortable and
19:46
fulfilling to do something that you're good at and where you feel like you can
19:52
thrive in and succeed in right and that you also have passion for so I had to
19:57
surrender rurr that completely and I had to do the opposite of that I had to I had to go in feeling like horrible
20:07
weak like I'm I don't know what I'm doing I'm not good at this you know but but through all of that I never had any
20:13
Grudge or bitterness towards God I never I never felt like like H God why did you
20:21
have to like call me to this and make me give up my dreams I never felt any of
20:26
that never never never never never but it's it's just because God in his goodness and Grace like led me on this
20:33
journey of opening my eyes day after day of his character of his goodness of his
20:40
faithfulness so he brought me to this place of me knowing knowing he knows best he is Lord I am creation so if he
20:49
calls me to do something that seems crazy I trust
20:55
him who am I to think I know better he got me to that place and so once since
21:01
my eyes were really opened in that area I was just content I was just at
21:07
the end of the day I I mean I'm not going to deny it was so uncomfortable it was difficult but I always had respect
21:16
reverence and Trust for God I always even had gratitude that he called me to
21:24
this that he made it clear this is my calling that he redirected me you know so um to answer the question how do you
21:32
know if your big dream is yours or is your own desires or from God the answer
21:38
is don't rush it the most important thing to do is like don't rush trying to figure it out
21:45
because the answer might not be right away I know there's one thing I do know
21:51
that when I was when I moved to LA thinking that God was calling me to acting then thinking he was calling me
21:58
to sing to be a singer I believe that I was being led by
22:04
the Holy Spirit it was just like like it's not like he was absent from my life it's not
22:11
like I couldn't hear him at all and I just got it completely wrong but it was that God did not want to it wasn't God's
22:19
timing to release my calling yet and God didn't want me to just sit
22:24
on my hands and do nothing for those years but he actually wanted me to go on
22:29
a journey with him a Journey of Faith a journey of
22:36
um following hearing his voice following him growing closer to him and those
22:42
kinds of things aren't going to happen just like in in your room sitting at home you can't just be like I don't know
22:48
what God's calling me to do so I'm not going to work I'm not going to pursue anything I'm just gonna focus on my
22:54
relationship with God and just close the door and sit in my house all day every day it doesn't work that way um the
23:02
Bible talks about the importance of work it talks about the importance that we work and that we work hard and that we
23:09
will be poor and we and to summarize it the Bible talks about like how we will be poor and we won't be able to eat if
23:15
we don't work you know and so to to work
23:20
doesn't always have to be like your ultimate calling some people are sitting on their hands not doing anything
23:26
because they're thinking that to work is a waste if it's not your your absolute
23:31
calling but I hate to break it to you your absolute calling is not going to be
23:37
released like day one of you being on this Earth or you know the moment that
23:44
you're trying to pick out colleges or the day you graduate from college no
23:50
it's released when God wants and so in the meantime um you know when it when it
23:56
comes to like when God reveals this is what you're supposed to doing with your life all the time the majority of your
24:01
life I want you to do this career because I'm going to use you in this purpose here whether that's a minister or whether that's a career anywhere in
24:09
this world um but you know a but purpose I want you to have this job so I can use
24:14
you through this job um before God releases that we still have to work and
24:21
God still wants us to use us in that workplace even if that's not our
24:26
absolute calling he still wants to use you he still I nannied and a boy the Boy
24:32
I nannied um came to Jesus and received healing in my car and he was in a Jewish
24:39
Family with no Christian influences so there was such purpose in that nanning job that was only like $16 an hour
24:46
part-time there was such purpose there that wasn't my um absolute calling to be
24:53
a nanny but when I was nannying God used me there when I was waitressing many
24:58
years God used me there I made intention every time I went to a table to Shine
25:06
the Light of Christ to be so loving um with truly just the purpose of I want
25:11
them to experience the love of God not not with the purpose of I want to get a good tip but I'm going with this
25:18
intention of I Want To Shine the Light of Jesus I want to plant a seed here I want to be really really kind and loving
25:24
to them so they can encounter God's love and those those things I did to be a
25:29
waitress to be a nanny like that was not this huge like Prophet speaking to me a
25:35
huge dream Nanny this is where I will use you God can use you in so many
25:40
different places there's his lost PE lost people are everywhere there are people who need God's love everywhere
25:48
and so many times it's like God wants you to choose go get a job I'm going to
25:54
use you there in the time being before it's time for God to say this is what I
26:00
want you to do for the majority of your life or this is what I want you to do for the like the rest of your life if
26:08
you're later on in life um when you're coming to your surrender point when God
26:13
can really put you in your absolute calling yeah so um in terms of knowing
26:21
is this dream from God or not what's the most important thing you can do is surrender and to daily surrender and to
26:28
just continue to give it to God like Lord this I love this dream this is um
26:35
this that I'm pursuing or whatever uh or maybe it hasn't come yet but it's a dream you think about and pray about a lot like I love this dream but I just I
26:45
want I want complete Clarity that this is from you or if it's not from you Lord
26:52
make it clear I just want to be in your will when you truly give that to God the
26:57
B ible says that God directs us up to the righteous men or women so you don't have to worry about um missing his voice
27:04
or something like if you surrender God will make it clear he might not make it
27:09
clear the first day you say that prayer But as time goes on in his perfect
27:15
timing he will make it clear you know when I was pursuing music um I
27:21
surrendered to God I said God you can take my dreams you can take my plans you can take my will everything everything
27:26
Lord I give it to you and so 9 months later God answered that prayer it wasn't that next day but it
27:34
wasn't that next day that God said well this isn't actually the absolute calling that you think it is this music um but
27:41
it's something different it was nine months later but in God's perfect timing he made it
27:46
clear so continue to surrender to God and wait on him for the clarity and if
27:52
you don't have the clarity yet it means that you're in that season like I was before the season of college the season
27:58
of pursuing acting the season of pursuing wedding planning the season of pursuing music where God was still using
28:05
me but he was preparing me preparing me to receive that direction of this is
28:12
really your calling or this is where I want you to work because I'm really going to use you in purpose
28:20
here amen is Jesus just as close to un
28:27
Believers as he is to Believers it's just that Believers know he's close and unbelievers don't
28:34
know so God loves every single person on this Earth every single person he loves
28:40
and he is pursuing he is pursuing he is pursuing many times through other people
28:46
like when we are showing love to somebody it's it's God himself like leading us like I want you to love on
28:52
this person because I love this person so much and they don't know me and I am pursuing them now now so please be
28:59
obedient be a vessel of me so I can pursue them that's what's going on when we love everybody we love our enemies we
29:06
love strangers it's actually really exciting and it's really beautiful it's it's really it's not just us being nice
29:12
us being Christlike us you know showing God's love it's it's it's it's God
29:19
pursuing the Lost through us it's powerful Hallelujah um but you know there's
29:28
different levels of closeness with god um we see like God say about David he is
29:37
a man after my heart there is a specific
29:45
favor that God has over David he said he is a man after my
29:52
heart and he will do whatever my will is whatever I want him to do he will do
30:00
so it just shows that God noticed David David stood out and that David was close
30:08
to God's heart because David had this he had reverence for God he had respect for
30:14
God he cared about God's dreams desires heart over his
30:21
own and you know just the fact that that God says he's after my heart it shows
30:27
that obviously God Is Not A Robot God is a person you know God we are made in God's
30:34
image and so there are going to be certain people that touch your heart more than others
30:40
there are going to be certain people that are even closer in your heart than others it doesn't mean you don't love
30:45
others but it's just natural it's part of our image part of um like not being a
30:54
robot but being a person you know so we see
30:59
Joseph was beloved and favored by his
31:05
father um and he had many other brothers but Joseph was beloved he gave him a
31:11
coat of many colors and the brothers were jealous of Joseph now it wasn't
31:16
like Joseph it wasn't like Jacob Joseph's father was doing something wrong it wasn't something to be looked
31:23
down upon you know that he favored Joseph that he didn't like make sure he
31:28
all his children knew they he loved them equal no his love was great for all of
31:33
them but Joseph was going the extra mile and really blessing him and touching his
31:41
heart and so there was even more love for upon Joseph this isn't a bad
31:50
thing this is I mean Jesus he had three close
31:56
disciples three he brought closest to him on the mount Transfiguration on at the Garden
32:02
of Gethsemane that is not a bad thing it's I mean it shows that there is that these
32:08
three were more after Jesus's heart um were more reverent more spiritually
32:16
mature and Jesus's heart was even more for them there's nothing wrong with that
32:23
um so that's how it is with God that's
32:29
how it is with God there are modern-day Davids that are after God's heart who
32:34
are even closer to God's heart who are real friends of
32:41
God um you know people who don't really have reverence and are lukewarm they
32:50
don't have reverence for God they're lukewarm sometimes maybe they'll be used be used by the enemy I
32:56
mean there's a lot lot of there's a lot of so-called Christians that speak against God's work God's
33:05
Revival God's servants they're liter and they're literally being agents of the devil when they do that they're
33:12
literally um being an enemy of God the Bible talks about how God has enemies um
33:17
they are literally hurting God's heart bringing hurt you know so um God still loves them
33:26
though he still loves them just like how we're called to love our enemies but like our enemies aren't going to be in the
33:33
closest in the holiest of holy place right so that's how it is in this world
33:41
the the ones who are unbelievers um they are farther from
33:46
God's heart but God still loves them so much so much and he's pursuing them
33:52
every day and then the Christians who are like
33:58
lukewarm they are a little closer to God's heart
34:04
but not as close as the ones really after God's heart and really
34:13
surrendered speaking of being closer to God's heart what is your favorite ways your number one favorite way to minister
34:19
to The Father's Heart so my favorite way to minister to The Father's Heart so when we say minister to The Father's
34:24
Heart that just means showing love to God blessing his heart touching his
34:31
heart and God has revealed to me that obedience to him is what touches his
34:38
heart the most it's his his number one love
34:44
language how how he desires to receive love from us is
34:51
obedience so you know if if I wasn't n thinking
34:59
about what God wanted I would be spending way more time
35:06
singing songs of worship to God every day now God loves when we sing to him
35:12
God loves when we worship him through song absolutely this should be a part of our Lives not just every week and
35:19
Sundays at church but in our own personal time we should sing good voice or bad voice we should sing praises to
35:24
God sing worship to God lift our Vo is but um you know singing singing was
35:31
my greatest passion it's not anymore because God's really transformed my heart and it's
35:36
still a great Passion but it was like my greatest passion and um I used to just love to just sing sing to God worship to
35:43
God sing to God all the time and um but God really convicted me
35:50
about how he wanted me to go after his heart go after his love language and so
35:58
like let's say I wanted to just sing how I wanted to minister to God's heart was
36:04
singing worship for a couple a few hours a day or something
36:11
right um but let's say that God wants me to
36:16
obey him in other means in some of those hours of time God wants me to do work for him God wants me
36:24
to do work for the ministry for him um I mean it could even be like even
36:31
even like this even um this week like this week's busy for me as I um travel
36:36
on Thursday to go Minister Friday at Portland and I'm going live tomorrow so
36:42
I could you know just be thinking well I want to just minister to God's heart by singing and singing today instead of
36:49
doing a subscriber alive but God speaking I want you to be obedient to me I want you to do my work I want you to
36:56
minister minister to my heart in this way and do a subscriber life it's like that so God convicted me
37:03
of that pretty early on when he uh called me into the ministry called me um
37:10
to be an apostle and it really shifted how I ministered to God's heart it
37:16
shifted my [Music] um like personal time with God
37:21
relationship with God it it shifted to really focus on obedience obedience
37:28
rather than a checklist read the Bible pray worship um you know instead of this
37:35
checklist it became about obedience it became purely about obedience and throwing out the checklist
37:42
throwing out the checklist completely the religious checklist the routine legalism but purely obedience and
37:49
[Music] um still to this day but even more so in
37:54
the early days there wasn't much of in the early days there wasn't much of a team I didn't have like pretty much
38:02
hardly anyone to help me but God was calling me to do so much he was calling me to learn how to edit edit
38:08
videos preach every Sunday um Minister every Friday service we had we used to
38:14
have do all the social media make all the graphics
38:19
um a lot it was like it was a lot you know and God was calling me to do all these things and um it's like God wanted
38:27
all these things to get done not for me to wait for more people to come and help these things get done God God spoke I
38:34
need I need these things to be done prophetic word from my spiritual father was that he saw the way that this
38:42
revival was going to break out and these promises were going to be fulfilled for my life and also the the prophecy of
38:48
Revival is now was going to be through one minute videos that the people were going to see these one minute videos and
38:54
they this is how these promises were going to be fulfilled the S Revival was going to break out and so when I got
39:00
that prophecy that was um like a a couple years into first receiving the
39:06
prophecy when I got that prophetic word and at that time I didn't know how to I didn't I didn't edit I had to te and and
39:13
I had no team so I was like well God wants this to happen so I have to make this to happen I I mean God is God
39:20
instructed me like get this done so I got to get it done so um if I don't have
39:25
a team I have to figure it out myself I have to teach myself I have to do it myself and I just kept putting out those
39:33
videos and then a video one day went viral on um New Year's Eve
39:40
2020 and that's how Revival began to break out was through that one video and
39:46
it continued to increase so mightily through videos it's been that prophetic
39:51
word through those one minute videos that prophetic word has come to pass not just one time it's just SP again and
39:57
again and again um even this is so powerful this is so powerful I just
40:02
released a little around a one minute now it's changed to well now you can have reals that are a minute and a half
40:08
so I just released a powerful Deliverance moment from Sydney Australia
40:14
a few days ago and that video has 1 million views both on Instagram and 1 million views on Facebook right now in
40:21
such a short amount of time and on Facebook there has been 20,000 new followers
40:27
since that video went viral in just a few days hallelujah glory to God so many
40:34
more thousands will encounter Jesus in power and know his love and be set free
40:40
but um it's still that Obedience of that prophetic word I'm seeing I'm seeing the
40:45
fruits of that prophetic word so um God started to speak to me like I
40:52
have so much that I want you to do for me I want you to do for my king Kingdom there's a lot of work I want you to do
40:58
to me and this is what's really really important because what's the most important thing to God is
41:04
for souls to be saved healed delivered and know his love and um there comes a
41:10
point where we have to grow up and mature we know God loves us we we know
41:17
he loves us we are in relationship and there's comes a point we have to get past the honeymoon
41:23
stage um of like vacation and and get to work and C- labor with God together
41:30
while remaining intimate with God throughout all of that just like a married couple if they're doing well
41:37
let's say they're taking care of their kids they're doing work around the house but they're together doing the work
41:42
around the house they're together taking care of their kids um doing things with their kids they're having intimacy all
41:49
throughout that so it's just as much intimacy as the honeymoon period where
41:55
they're vacationing and having fun and not having to do any work that's how it is with god um God is really about his
42:02
business Jesus says I'm about my father's business Jesus was really at work so much he was taking time to rest
42:08
absolutely he was taking time to have intimate prayer time with God absolutely but when you read the gospels he is
42:15
really at work so much he is working hard for God because it is not it is no
42:23
small thing I mean it is not something to be played around with or um mess around with the
42:31
salvation of all these lost souls right now in the world like it's critical
42:37
it's it's a big deal it's a big job that we are doing with God and we got to take
42:43
it seriously we can't be thinking about ourselves too much so much we got to
42:49
take it seriously God's really mean serious business so um that's how I
42:55
minister to God's heart is obedience to him and I renew my mind that he is proud
43:02
as I'm um obeying him as I'm doing work for him
43:08
amen [Music]
43:14
amen is it my responsibility to go for doctor's checkups like yearly migs or would that be an open door for the
43:20
spirit of fear yeah to have a doctor's checkup to have dentist checkup
43:26
you know all of these things that's part of taking care of your body sometimes
43:33
um sometimes sometimes oh by the way okay so sometimes we're just not taking care of our body and that's why we're
43:39
getting sick so sometimes you might not be aware that you're not taking care of your body very well in a certain area
43:46
and you're like you know just like oh nothing will happen to me you know byas
43:52
Stripes I'm Healed and then something comes comes up and you're just like only
43:58
going in the spirit but we have to understand we're Spirit soul and body so going in the spirit has to also mean
44:05
that we are not neglecting our soul and our body so
44:12
like to like okay God doesn't go against we're not
44:19
like robotic like we can't just eat whatever we want we can't like get hardly any sleep not drink much water
44:25
not exercise and God just like um protects us and makes us to be
44:33
perfectly healthy no we live in this world God created us he created us where
44:39
where where we have to take care of our bodies where we have to drink we have to drink water we have to eat we have to
44:46
sleep because we're on this Earth We're not in heaven yet we but but these rules apply to us like we have rules of being
44:53
on this Earth we have rules that we have to follow in order for us to survive and
45:00
also Thrive we can't neglect the physical so um we have to work together
45:07
with the physical and the spirit Spirit soul and body we have to work all together right so
45:13
um you know maybe you go to the doctor and they find an issue it doesn't always mean
45:21
that this is a demonic attack it could mean you're not get enough
45:27
nutrients you're not eating you're not you're you're eating your
45:33
food not in the mind of I need to get all my nutrients that I need right maybe
45:38
you're not drinking enough water maybe you're not sleeping enough maybe you're not
45:45
exercising you know there's real like science in our bodies um I was watching
45:51
I was just watching something about like this kind of like documentary about um the human body
45:56
how God made us but it's like people that sit all the time their um
46:03
circulation isn't as good and our heart's like what we heart's the most important thing like we need our heart
46:09
to be healthy we need the circulation and the blood to like go throughout our bodies and so if you are every day every
46:19
day sitting down the whole day and you're not getting up for at least like 20
46:24
minutes they're quite possibly could be an issue that arises has nothing to do with the devil
46:31
attacking you at all but it's simply that you're not following the rules that
46:37
are here on this Earth for our body to function well you got to you have to eat
46:42
right and if you don't know how to eat right find out what that means like vegetables fruit protein getting the
46:49
right nutrients like we need we need iron we need all these certain in nutrients every like part of our life um
46:59
you need you need um water you need to drink a lot of water you can be getting
47:05
headaches simp every simply because you're not drinking enough water or if you're a woman who's on their period and
47:12
you're drinking quite a bit of water but you need more water and that's why you're so tired and have so many
47:20
headaches you know things like this um you need to exercise you all these
47:25
things so um going to a doctor is is is a good thing like as a checkup sometimes
47:32
they can identify there's something wrong here and it doesn't mean oh this is the devil speaking you know um it's
47:39
important for you to to reflect like am I taking care of my body while also
47:44
declaring Jesus's Stripes by his stripes I am healed and I decare that whatever
47:50
this issue is it must go in Jesus name can you talk about how to handle
47:56
periods spiritually um you don't have to be sorry to ask this um well you know what there's been
48:04
a lot of testimonies that I've received of PE of people who had horrible
48:09
periods whether is they're bleeding way too much or they're like insanely tired
48:14
or insane cramps all sorts of issues but I've heard so many testimonies that of that
48:22
that that that the bleeding diminished that the headache stopped the pain stopped whatever all the symptoms like
48:29
completely went away the bad symptoms I've heard a lot of these testimonies
48:34
and it's it surprises me and shocks me things that I didn't even know God was going to do this is one of them like wow
48:40
thank you Jesus it shows that there are it it can be demonic sometimes it can be
48:45
a demonic attack even even for a you know issues of periods so um I would say
48:54
take care of your physical body like getting more sleep during that time drinking more water um and going in the
49:04
spirit so if this is something you struggle with these symptoms are really bad I uh renounce them also sew a
49:13
seed plant that seed believing God will produce that fruit of the healing and
49:19
the freedom any time you have a need it is it is it is a good spiritual
49:24
principle to make a sacrifice to God um he gives it freely but it's it's the
49:31
principle that his miracles aren't cheap and we value them and we want to
49:37
sacrifice for them we want to show value toward for them and we we we having need
49:44
of more of the anointing in our lives and so we are sewing into this anointing to receive more of that anointing Upon
49:52
Our Lives which in this case can mean to cover that certain
50:00
need and declare so position yourself in the anointing renounce so and declare so
50:08
declare the cramps must go the headaches must go whatever the issues
50:14
are this bleeding must stop should one spouse have the same
50:21
spiritual parent and be planted under the same church yes absolutely that is
50:26
ideal that is where there will be the most abundant life thriving peace um
50:34
Clarity order that is what is ideal so
50:40
um that's the that's the great importance of not rushing into marriage
50:46
but waiting until the right one comes and you are equally yolked and so you on
50:52
the same page spiritually you're on the the same page and so if comes a time
50:58
when God directs you maybe to be planted somewhere else because maybe someone had an encountered maybe you guys had maybe
51:05
the the couple um their eyes weren't fully open yet but
51:10
then there comes this shift and but because they're equally yolked they'll be able to hear God saying go here you
51:19
you were you become one when you're married so it is important um for you to
51:24
have the same spiritual parent and be planted at the same church now I know that there are many who were already married
51:31
and um are not equally yolked or their spouse's eyes aren't opened up
51:38
in the spiritual realm like theirs are and so there is Grace for you it is not something
51:45
to like feel depressed about that God understands there is Grace there is
51:51
absolutely Grace so don't be troubled or disturbed when your spouse isn't you
51:57
know automatically on the same page as you have faith and have hope in God pray
52:03
for them declare for them renounce for them um SE seeds for
52:10
them and call them into the kingdom call them into the kingdom if they're in the
52:16
kingdom of darkness if they're not a Believer at all SE a seed for them and
52:21
declare I call them out of the kingdom of darkness and I call them into the kingdom of God this also applies though
52:29
to if someone is saved but they're I mean they are a Believer but they are not in the fullness of God's kingdom
52:36
like maybe they don't believe in the power of God um well that's a problem we
52:42
we H we have to accept all of Jesus and all of his
52:48
kingdom not partial so it's it's still a serious deal we got to call them into
52:53
the kingdom of God the true kingdom of God so declare them sew a seed for them
52:59
renounce for them declare them to come into the truth come into the kingdom of
53:04
God their eyes to open up amen and when you
53:11
are it's it's important for you to know that you like if a couple is equally
53:18
yolked if they're equally yolked they're planted at the same place have the same
53:23
spiritual father and mother um you know living in the house together
53:30
is is going to be kind of easier in terms of having victory over the devil
53:38
it's like there will be unity and the enemy won't ever use the spouse towards
53:43
you but when you're unequally yolked it's something for you to understand that it it's it's more of a
53:51
spiritual battle not that you cannot win it's just more that it's it's more of a battle once again nothing to be
53:59
depressed about disturbed about troubled about God is giving you extra Grace that
54:04
you need for this situation God is with you and God is using this as a situation
54:10
to refine you more we all have our different refining fire periods um I
54:16
mean we have different trials and so this is going to be a big trial for you and so God is going to use it for
54:23
the good so don't be disturbed Ed about it discouraged about it God is going to use us for the good so but instead of
54:30
the spiritual warfare coming from outward of the house it may at times be
54:35
coming inward in the house um you know if The spouse's eyes spiritual eyes are not open there can be spiritual warfare
54:42
coming through the spouse towards you you can have Victory you will have victory in jesus' name but it just means
54:48
you really need to be serious in the spiritual realm you need to be serious about your surrender you need to be serious about going to to battle every
54:55
day rejecting the lies of the devil and walking in Victory and not letting your guard down even though it's in your own
55:02
home not letting your guard down but staying in the spirit and trusting that
55:07
God is bringing the victory is going to bring the transformation in your spouse
55:14
in his in their life in his or her life when life gets super busy and you
55:19
can't listen to your teachings how can we remain spiritually fed um just as I
55:25
shared uh last week no matter how busy life gets you have to make God a
55:31
priority you have to make Jesus your priority and making Jesus
55:38
your priority is two parts your relationship and intimacy with Jesus and
55:43
number two doing what he has called you to do
55:48
on this Earth which is which to do what he's called to do on this Earth this
55:54
means you have to be H be have victory over the devil and actually be effective in the kingdom and for that to take
56:00
place you have to be equipped you have to be fed spiritually you have to be planted at a church you have to follow
56:08
those spiritual principles you have to regularly be fed you have to regularly be receiving anointed teachings to help
56:15
keep you focused keep you on track open your spiritual eyes equip you for what
56:21
the devil has coming this given week um this is how God keeps you protected and
56:29
makes you to grow spiritually to have victory over the devil and also be effective in the Kingdom so it's not
56:35
only about keeping do shut to the devil and not allowing him to have hold on your
56:40
life but it's also about being effective in the Kingdom so not just you maintaining freedom but you being
56:48
powerful for the kingdom and to be powerful of the Kingdom you have to be equipped you have to grow you your
56:54
spiritual need to open up you need to be um anointed and so for God to entrust
57:00
you with anointing you have to follow these principles you have to be trustworthy and loyal and faithful to
57:05
him which also means loyal faithful to his church to where he is equipping you
57:14
so you have to make that priority no matter how busy you are you have to do what you need to do to make it a
57:19
priority in a certain season maybe that mean like um
57:25
I mean if it's a certain day or a certain week where it's just crazy busy like one thing after the other and it's
57:32
nothing there's like nothing you can remove for a certain season I know especially with kids it can get like
57:39
this sometimes um you have to find time to be fed um
57:46
even maybe sometimes it can be driving as you're driving you put it on in the car as you're going for a walk
57:55
you need to make it you need to make it a priority to get some sort of exercise usually and so put it on as you walk um
58:04
if you're doing anything around the house where you're able to be present in your mind maybe it's cleaning or
58:10
something but you're able to really be present listen there um it's really
58:16
ideal and important if at all possible to give full undivided attention to
58:23
teachings like a especially Sunday service and um a live that I go that I
58:29
do every week for example um but uh if
58:36
if it's a if if if something's happening something comes up at least get the
58:41
listening in somehow get just make it a priority somehow I notice if I get slack if I
58:49
slack on the teachings the devil attacks affect me more yeah it's so true you need this you
58:57
need this food you need the equipping to stay strong I want to declare over all
59:04
of you watching right now I speak that every area of demonic bondage I speak it
59:11
to be broken I declare every demonic sphere attacking your health it must go
59:18
I declare every demonic Spirit attacking your sleep it must go I declare every demonic Spirit bringing distraction upon
59:26
your life uh distraction from Jesus and
59:31
and being planted and being fed it must be removed from your life in jesus' name
59:37
and I speak healing over every person here healing over every problem physical
59:43
problem in Jesus name I declare freedom in the mind I speak peace over every
59:50
mind in jesus' name and I release this anointing upon you now fresh level fresh level of
59:59
anointing upon you may you grow in the spirit may all
1:00:06
that you have received may it stay remain in you and increase you may your
1:00:13
