can a parent cast a demon out of a child if the parent hasn't gone through Deliverance
0:07
so the first thing is that it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke so that
0:13
means that it's the anointing the power of God that makes a demon to go a yoke
0:18
is a demon a demonic Spirit uh an oppression from the enemy it is the
0:25
anointing the power of God and the power of God is found in vessels not all
0:30
vessels but vessels whom God has poured his anointing in vessels whom he has chosen vessels who are surrendered who
0:37
are humble who are obedient and he pours out his anointing
0:42
upon vessels not not when they're perfect but when they show that their
0:48
heart can can be trusted and and he can see
0:54
that they they they can change if they have flaws maybe he can see that they
1:00
have the potential to change that they that they can change that they desire to change that their heart is good and
1:05
wants to change so it's not that the anointing is only poured in perfect
1:10
vessels but um people who are you know um not having any flaws anymore but
1:18
first of all God pours out the anointing in chosen ones such as how David was a
1:24
Chosen One such as how Paul was a Chosen One in his fivefold ministers in his
1:30
Apostles prophets for example and he pours out a high level measure of
1:36
anointing in those chosen vessels and those vessels are now to equip the
1:43
Believers and release impartation of anointing to the Believers so when you
1:49
come to a church where the power of God is moving you are finding a leader at of
1:55
that church who's truly called by God who's truly anointed they have received
2:01
a a high measure of anointing from God and it is their responsibility their job
2:09
in the body of Christ to cast out demons to heal the sick to equip others to be
2:15
mature vessels of God and to be a vessel of God who can also carry the anointing and impart the anointing into them so
2:22
anyways this anointing is rare today God is restoring it in the body of Christ but it is rare it is not found in every
2:30
Church it is not found in most churches you'll find the anointing is where Miracles are taking place where
2:37
Deliverance is taking place healing is taking place testimonies are being shared of people truly being delivered
2:44
healed changed transformed surrendered brought closer to Jesus and so many times people are
2:52
trying to cast out demons but they don't have the anointing they love Jesus but they don't have the anointing and so the
2:57
demons aren't going to go so what's very important is to locate where God's
3:03
chosen vessels are where God's five-fold ministers Servants of God are and find
3:11
that anointing that's in them find a church where God's moving in
3:17
power come to that church in person online position yourself there and the
3:22
anointing will come and touch you will come and touch your children position your children there and the demons will
3:28
go so that's the really important um step to see your child delivered is to
3:35
position yourself and position the child where God's power is being released you
3:40
can come to five-fold church you can come in person you can come to an event to a conference you can come watching
3:45
online and bring your child there and demons will manifest and go position your child there the anointing will be
3:52
flowing through the screen and uh that's the most important thing
3:57
now once once you are position where the anointing is once you are positioned in the place to receive impartation because
4:04
the anointing comes through impartation for the most part you have to be planted at a church where God's power is
4:10
surrendered to God now the anointing will start to pour in your life for you to be able to walk in God's power and
4:16
cast out demons um so there can be times if you know you your child you command
4:22
the demon to go I know we had a testimony of that that happened um at fifel church a woman from Europe came
4:28
and testified that her child had autism and she received impartation of
4:34
anointing through the screen she commanded the demon to leave her child and the demon manifested and left her child Hallelujah but that never happened
4:42
she never saw change in her child until she positioned herself where God's power was moving as she watched 5f Church
4:48
online she received impartation of anointing she also received equipping of how to uh release that anointing
4:55
effectively of how to cast out demons and she commanded the demon to go but it's it's important to see like if
5:02
your child needs Deliverance it the question is not like how do I cast this
5:07
demon out of the P out of my child instead it's how can I see my child
5:12
delivered all right so it's not about like I need to cast this demon out maybe God will lead you to cast a demon out of
5:20
your child by as you receive impartation of anointing but also it could happen
5:25
just by you bringing your child watching online line coming in person and God
5:31
uses a servant of God to cast The Demon out of the child also a servant of God a
5:38
servant of God a fful minister they are going to be carrying a higher level of anointing Apostle Paul Apostle Peter
5:44
carried higher level anointing when Peter was ministering it says all were healed and all were delivered all who
5:51
came to where he was ministering under his shadow why we all healed well a big
5:56
reason why was because he was carrying a higher level anointing higher level Authority that could make every kind of
6:04
demon go high level principality kind of demons go and so that's why I say the
6:09
question is not how do I cast The Demon out of the of the child or of any person
6:14
rather how can I see this person set free because sometimes it God may want
6:20
to use you to cast a demon out of the person but other times it may just not be in your calling to operate in such a
6:26
high level of anointing and you may never be able to out of this person the
6:32
answer is to bring this person to where high level anointing is being released to the church to the present day shadow
6:40
of apostle Peter where all were healed and all were free amen when I see that a person needs
6:47
Deliverance but does not believe in God or is a Believer but religious can I help him spiritually in some way the
6:54
best thing yes the best thing you can do is to be the light and to plant seeds so
7:00
to be loving show the love of Christ to not like pour out all this meat all this
7:06
meaty teaching on them but pour out the milk I mean pour out simple love be the
7:12
light and plant seeds because you are carrying answers that this person needs
7:20
but the only way that this person can receive these answers through you is if
7:25
they in their own free will want to find these answers in you want to ask you
7:32
want to look to you for wisdom so you need to get what our our heart as
7:40
Believers is that we want people to be attracted to us so we can share Jesus with them so we can share the wisdom the
7:47
spiritual truth that God's given us that's our heart as Believers we want people to be attracted to us so we can
7:53
then release to them God he doesn't force himself on people instead he he he
8:01
waits for them to come to him the Bible says when you seek me and seek me with all of your heart then you will find me
8:08
knock and the door will be answered seek and you'll find the Bible says so that's God's heart he wants people to want him
8:15
and when people want him then he can release all that he wants to release to
8:20
them but they need to desire him he doesn't force himself and so it's the same principle that we we follow the
8:27
same principle we we do the same thing that our father does when we I mean we have we we need to have this heart
8:34
of I am ready to release what God has given me the truth the anointing the
8:42
prayers you know the the spiritual wisdom but I can only release it when
8:51
people have free will and they want to receive it from me so how do I get them to want to receive from me be attractive
8:58
be the light just show them love show them the love of Jesus that's what you can do okay so um
9:07
what can that look like practically just being kind to them just showing the supernatural love of God to them and as
9:15
you plant seeds many times that will make them want to that will make them attracted to you that will make them want to open up they may start asking
9:23
you now about your life you know they that conversation may lead into church
9:29
Church what you're passionate about Jesus um Freedom Deliverance you know
9:36
and that's when you're able to start really really helping them in the area
9:41
of needing Deliverance do you know the story of Saul who turned to Paul look at the
9:47
mercy that God gave Saul when Saul's eyes were not opened up God had such mercy and compassion for him and Grace
9:55
you know do not listen to the enemy's lies and use wisdom use wisdom you know
10:02
it's our God is so good if you did something wrong and you repent God is
10:08
going to forgive you this is wisdom this is you know I
10:14
think this is shared so much and so it's so important you you use that wisdom you
10:20
know and you you don't let the enemy speak to you things know when he's he's
10:25
lying to you know when he's trying to just get you down know when he's trying trying to twist words words of God that
10:33
have been spoken you you it's important you use this wisdom and and be
10:39
mature Hallelujah you need to be aware of the enemy trying to twist things
10:45
what's very important is you know the heart of God and you know my heart when I preach and teach and so if the enemy
10:52
is speaking something contrary to everything that I've shared you need to
10:58
you need to understand it's the enemy trying to twist like how he tries to twist the Bible it's very important you
11:04
use this wisdom or the enemy can just be um bringing Just deceit you know it's in
11:13
order to to walk in the truth and not be deceived we have to use wisdom we have
11:19
to use what has been released to us the the the wisdom that God has given you
11:25
how he's opened up your eyes to to his love you know when God shows you his
11:31
love and his mercy and his grace and his compassion when he's revealed it to you personally to you when he's revealed it
11:36
through me through his servant of God and you've seen this time and time and time and time and time again you see
11:43
this is who God is this is who God is this is who God is this is his amazing love you need to keep that in your heart
11:53
and you need to know that if the enemy ever speaks something against that you need to know
12:01
I know who God is he's revealed himself to me so this is the
12:08
devil lying amen it's very important you recognize that the devil is the father
12:14
of Lies the devil is always trying to beat you down the devil is always trying
12:20
to put fear in you the devil is always trying to make you feel shame the devil is always trying to bring up your past
12:27
the devil is always trying to cond demn you about your past the devil is always trying to push you away from God the
12:34
devil is always trying to make God look like he's not understanding not forgiving not full of grace what you
12:42
need to know this you need to know this and mature you need to really really
12:48
guard what you have received the Revelation you have received this is who God is this is who the devil is the
12:56
devil is out to steal and kill and this otherwise you're going to be a baby your whole life you're going to be a
13:02
baby Christian in your whole life you have to guard what you have received you
13:07
have to choose to believe the revelations that have become so real in your heart you have to choose to believe
13:14
that amen you know the people that in your life like the people that have
13:20
really gained your trust you you know someone can come up on the street and
13:25
tell you something about this person that is totally against their character and are you going to believe them no you
13:32
know this person you know that you know that you know and this is how it has to be with God this is how it has to be
13:38
with the spiritual truths that have been revealed to you you you know when when God opens your eyes you have to keep
13:45
your eyes open you have to guard your eyes being open when truth has been released to you and you know you you you
13:51
receive it you're like yes this is
13:56
truth you have to guard that the devil wants to steal that the devil wants to come back a week later a month later a
14:03
year later and say the opposite of that and make you question in that moment
14:08
when you received that truth you couldn't think about questioning it you know that you know that you know amen
14:15
and so the only way to mature the only way to have victory over the devil is to
14:22
treasure protect these truths you've received treasure and protect the
14:28
revelation of who God is treasure and protect everything
14:34
you've received the wisdom you've received you you know otherwise you you
14:40
know you're growing you're growing you're getting all this wisdom you're getting all this Revelation and then the
14:45
Devil comes and he tries to question all of that and you just you give it all away you throw away
14:53
all of that growth all that you've been accumulating that growth that Revelation
15:00

15:16
powerfully by God and also so that you can be a blessing to others and not always be a baby you know a baby um a
15:26

18:06
wisdom hallelujah hallelujah you can reject the devil's
18:13
lies yes Hallelujah you have this wisdom praise God I was just talking
18:21
about the devil can try to twist scripture try to try to twist teachings
18:26
words you know so how do you keep from being deceived from
18:33
that you know so the Bible is massive the word of God is massive and
18:41
one scripture can contain a lot of Revelation and can keep coming with more
18:47
Revelation again and again and again you can have new revelation years later of
18:53
one scripture that you've read so many times how do you uh uh not be dece so
19:00
the Bible has so much so much we can't know we can't know all of the revelation
19:07
of every scripture right now there's there's no way that that can be possible there's no way we can know all of the
19:14
revelation of the Bible tomorrow or next week or next year so um what I'm trying to say is you
19:22
know if you are not understanding a revelation of a certain scripture don't
19:27
fret don't fret you know don't like get hung up on one scripture and um become
19:34
obsessed with it you know like cuz you can't quite understand what it means or it's confusing you know rest you know
19:42
what what's important to know is God's character and his heart and
19:47
so you know it's not it's not it's not always God's timing for you to know a
19:53
revelation of something immediately when you want to have revelation of something immediately full revelation God knows
19:59
that you don't need that Revelation to do what he's called you to do you know maybe this revelation will come later he
20:05
wants it to come later for you but he wants you to be focused on other things on other topics principles in his word
20:13
first before he releases that Revelation you know so anyways like if the enemy is
20:20
trying to twist I mean recognize when the enem is trying to twist words in the Bible because sometimes the you know we
20:27
see God in the Old Testament and you know people were he would have people
20:33
die like his wrath would come you know what I mean but we still have the Bible
20:39
today we we don't throw out the Old Testament so that's just an example where it could be um confusing sometimes
20:46
like uh seeing God do certain things in the Old Testament or even in the New
20:53
Testament certain scriptures can feel confusing sometimes so what is important is to understand
21:01
you're not going to get all the Revelation all at once there will be scriptures you don't fully understand
21:06
that's okay but go back to the basics and focus on who God is his character his love how
21:16
he sees you how he sees your future and focus on the teachings that are being
21:22
released at your church many of you are planted at five-fold church where I Pastor so focus on the teachings
21:28
the the teachings that are being released that's what God is wanting you to focus on now 100% the church is your
21:35
place of being equipped your the church is like school is is is min is um school
21:41
for the believer Ministry School too it's it's the curriculum there is is
21:47
what God wants for you he knows this is what you need now um and this is what you need the next week and this is what
21:53
you need the next week so rather than getting hung up on certain
21:59
scriptures you know or certain topics if you start to feel
22:04
confusion if you start to feel like you're going around in a circle if you sense maybe the enem is trying to twist
22:10
the words and bring fear or something bring religion through a scripture
22:16
that's your sign to just stop stop with that you know going back and forth with
22:22
this this scripture and thinking thoughts and return to what you know
22:28
know God wants you to be receiving learning growing in in the word
22:35
now amen is having corporate all night prayer or 24 hours of prayer
22:43
religious so really the first thing I want to say is
22:48
that as I've been teaching recently about having a relationship with God if you've heard the teachings recently at
22:55
fivefold church um if you haven't go back on my YouTube fful Church's YouTube under live
23:02
and you can watch them but um as you've been learning about prayer relationship
23:07
with God and not just the past couple weeks but all the teachings that I'm teaching
23:12
are newwind and so as you've learned there's a lot of old wine when it comes to
23:20
prayer there's a lot of religion old wine in the body of Christ today when it comes to prayer when it comes to
23:26
relationship with God when it comes to prayer when it comes to really pretty much all aspects it's a lot of old wine
23:35
so um that being said many people if they're they have
23:42
they have in their mind if we all come together and pray and pray again and pray again and pray again the same thing
23:48
over and over again then God's hand will move um similar to the wrong doctrine of
23:56
if I fast then God's hand will move as if like I
24:03
need to do a religious ritual to get
24:08
something like in that kind of heart so those those kinds of doctrines are old
24:15
wine a lot that may be going on at 24-hour prayers corporate prayers maybe
24:21
a lot of religion maybe a lot of old wine maybe with this old wine thinking
24:27
and sometimes that can be it's like a scheme of the enemy and
24:33
to bring religion to try to stop people from doing the work of God
24:39
like God doesn't want us to waste time with religion you know like religious
24:45
activities religious rituals even like reciting of prayer over and over again
24:51
can be a waste of time actually can be taken away from doing
24:57
the work work of God you know that's a lot of what religion is is it's it's
25:04
rituals that are wasting time that are keeping PE keeping us from being
25:10
effective for the kingdom and you know that religion is is what the enemy wants
25:16
the relig religion is what keeps the church dry and not powerful religion is
25:23
what keeps people from casting out demons and destroying the Devil's
25:28
Kingdom you know so in that aspect there's religion there but you know to
25:36
there's a way to have events to have a time of prayer at church for example
25:42
there's a way to do that you know in a newwind way more in the aspect of
25:48
focusing God worshiping god um putting our eyes on God uh and praying you know
25:57
but so I I don't say that like any type of prayer Gathering you know 24-hour
26:03
prayer corporate prayer it's religious I'm not saying that but I will say that a lot of the you know the prayer
26:11
Gatherings happening today it's it's religion a lot of religion in there and
26:16
a lot of just like reciting the same kind of prayer when as I've been teaching
26:22
recently God wants us to pray with faith pray as a child pray believing that what
26:28
we asked he has heard and now it's time to rest and it's up to his timing but we
26:35
don't need to he heard us he heard us we we we're not moving the heart of God
26:40
more the more we're repeating the same prayer over and over and over again um
26:46
you know also to to share even more which I'll I'll share more on Sunday too but just to add on that like um if I'm
26:54
believing for something and I prayed for it I asked God for it I prayed for it
27:00
and you know it's been months that I haven't seen it yet or it's been years that I haven't seen it yet I have this understanding God heard me and I have
27:08
faith that he's going to bring this he's going to make this happen but now I'm
27:14
just resting in him and now I'm going to thank him so instead of asking again I thank him thank you Lord that this
27:22
promise will be fulfilled thank you Lord that you are doing this behind the scenes you are doing this and in your
27:30
timing in your will it's going to happen thank you Jesus so you see that's a prayer of faith it's not a request the
27:37
request has already been made um but it's just it's thanking God you know
27:43
instead of worrying complaining uh requesting again you are you are putting
27:48
your faith forward Lord I remember I prayed this I know you heard it and I
27:54
thank you that you've heard it and I thank you that you're carrying it out and I thank you that it's there in the spirit and I will see it manifest in the
28:01
physical in realm in your timing amen do you have wisdom for me as
28:06
a high school teacher and keeping my profile public be private be private and still be effective in
28:12
Sharing keeping my profile public be private I'm not sure what that what you're saying there but I'm going to I
28:19
think you're asking as a um High School teacher if your profile is public um
28:25
like can you share you know about Jesus and the Revival I'm thinking that's what
28:30
you're sharing well I don't know where you live but in most places like in
28:37
America I think most places in Europe all most places most Nations there's freedom of religion freedom of religion
28:45
so that means that every person is entitled to having their own faith anybody can choose to they can believe
28:52
in Jesus they can choose to believe in Jesus who does Miracles and casts out demons they can choose to believe in
28:58
Budd they can choose choose to believe in whatever God they want to believe in or no God that is freedom of
29:07
religion and most Nations like for example America I believe most of Europe
29:13
freedom of religion also means like you don't have to hide your your faith um
29:21
you don't ha you you you are allowed to speak this is my faith you know um and
29:28
so today on social media a social your social media account is an extension of
29:35
your self your personal life your social media account is not connected to your
29:44
job in general now people can think different things but I'm just saying in general probably according to
29:52
most laws too I don't know all the laws but I'm I'm saying I'm pretty sure that's it counts as freedom of of speech
29:58
social media Freedom which connects to freedom of Faith freedom of religion you
30:04
know as someone who has a job in the public space you know you should never
30:09
feel insecure about using your social media to share about Jesus now Jesus is
30:16
controversial Jesus in this revival is controversial but we are called to not fear man and we are called to be
30:22
unashamed of our Jesus Hallelujah and so of course there will be people who don't understand there be people who think
30:29
wrong things that aren't true about us and about our Jesus but that's to be expected that's part of persecution is
30:35
for people to be thinking and saying those things that's part of our life as a Believer that's no secret according to
30:41
the word so yeah it's very important that you you understand that like your
30:47
social media that's this is the platform God has giving you this is this is your
30:54
place where you are called to share the gospel where you're called to share the good news you're called to share your
31:00
testimony God is counting all of us to do counting on counting on all of us to do that to spread his good news that's
31:07
the most effective way to reach the most amount of people amen and so like there
31:14
may be certain rules at the job at the school for example where like you're
31:20
allowed to have your own faith but you are not allowed to to put your faith on
31:26
others and teach your faith like that's understandable like that's un that's okay to go and teach for example and
31:32
just teach the curriculum of math or whatever you know that's fine that's you
31:38
know we don't have to feel bad that we're not preaching about Jesus in in the school like that's okay um we we H
31:45
you have your platform on social media in your life when you your family your
31:50
friends um people that you meet in the airplane or in the grocery store at at
31:55
the hair salon like there there's going to be opportunities that God is going to give you to share the gospel with with
32:02
people to share about Jesus so you don't need to feel bad if in your job you're
32:08
not the the rules you're not supposed to be like teaching about Jesus that being said you can be aware of opportunities
32:16
you you be the light and you shine the light of Jesus and you be so loving to people and then you look for opportunities for people who may be
32:23
coming up to you and asking you about your faith and then you can um share with them know that's okay uh in most
32:29
place most situations that's probably going to be okay you know like maybe if
32:35
it's after class or something and the conversation just starts to happen with a student for example to share with
32:41
wisdom you know to share gently you know that that can happen sometimes and you
32:47
trust God for protection also like in those types of scenarios you trust God for protection that he's covering you
32:54
because maybe certain people in the school would think that that was cross in lines and you shouldn't be doing that
33:00
but the P the child just came maybe a person came to you after class and it
33:06
was just it was not having to do with the the your job teaching in that that
33:13
session for example this is just an example I'm giving of just how you'll walk in wisdom and also believe in God
33:22
for protection and also not feel like religious and like
33:28
uh oh I have to share the gospel with everybody here and I don't care what the school thinks like you know you don't be
33:35
forceful because as we follow the Holy Spirit that's where the grace is as we follow how holy spirit is with walking
33:41
in wisdom and planting seeds and going gently and going according to people's Free Will that's where Grace is so when
33:49
we so like there will be that Grace and that protection that will cover you in situations like this when you walk in
33:56
wisdom and you walk like how Jesus did and you follow the Holy Spirit rather than religion and forcefulness and
34:02
performance and all of that amen um yeah and so now in regards to sharing on
34:09
social media um just you know you you know you can walk in wisdom in that as
34:14
well you can walk in wisdom as that as like um share your testimony you know
34:20
but and and share everything with love and share everything with Grace here's an example of what I mean like you in
34:27
you you know people could you could write something on social media that's like not coming from the heart of God
34:34
that's like being forceful and being judgmental you could be like you could write on your status or whatever like
34:42
um something judgmental like you're all going to go to hell if
34:48
you don't Cho if you don't come to Jesus and you all are living such Evil dark
34:55
lives and God is watching and you know um or just even speaking about demons
35:02
and deliverance in a way that's like abrasive and judgmental maybe
35:07
like you you people out there you people out there with mental problems and addiction and depression do you know
35:14
that you have demons actually like you know if it's know your audience like if you if you're speaking it in this way
35:20
that's like very abrasive and pushy and coming off judgmental you
35:27
know it's the same principle I'm sharing with like you're you're leaving God's grace
35:32
area like walking in his wisdom is where there's so much grace and protection all the grace and protection starting to be
35:40
religious starting to be um judgmental not being loving you're you're stepping
35:45
out of his will you're stepping out of the grace and protection that's where you can start to have problems right so
35:51
if you're walking in wisdom being like Jesus like as you share for example you
35:58
you know God is going to protect you God is going to protect you and people
36:03
aren't going to be giving you all these problems from like what you're posting for example um now I'm not saying that
36:10
can't ever happen the enemy I mean you you can be walking in wisdom and enemy
36:15
can use somebody but the difference is you'll have Victory you'll have Victory there could be an attack there could be
36:22
someone that says what are you posting and whatever um you will have Victory
36:28
God will protect you through that amen how do you know how much to share on
36:33
social media when many of the people that follow me are from Abram land meaning
36:41
before this person um their eyes were opened up they became surrendered to Jesus they became a new creation and
36:48
walking in this Revelation now so and they're from their past um are they just being nosy should
36:54
I keep these people both family and friends on my social media um so this is what I would say to do so
37:02
on your social media um maybe if there
37:08
was people from your past that you know God is really calling you to put strong
37:14
boundaries up in like it could be it could be go like um people you dated in the past now it
37:23
will depend but there could be like a lot of worldly relationship ship you've had in the
37:29
past where it's important that there's strong boundaries that are put up and you know
37:36
you you you you are not God is not calling you to be the one to like save
37:43
them you know there's certain people that from your past that if you're
37:48
keeping on seeing them on their on your social media show up all the time like on the news feed like Facebook friends
37:54
for example right when you're like friends it's like that person you keep seeing their their
37:59
posts and everything so like let's say it's someone you dated from your past and maybe it was a really long time ago
38:05
but when you see their posts it's like you're brought you keep being brought back to your past you keep on
38:11
remembering the sins you did with them and um you know the enemy then starts
38:18
bringing shame and all of that so that's a situation where it's really wise to
38:24
really cut ties because of that senu engaged with in with that person for the
38:31
most part it's it's usually the wisdom to to remove them as a friend simply for
38:36
your spiritual health so you're not seeing them all of the time I don't mean this for every every s every single
38:44
situation you know I mean maybe it could be that that person became saved and
38:49
they're totally transformed and you're both transformed now and um you're not like close in relationship but you're on
38:56
like friendly terms like there can be those situations but for the most part
39:02
for the most part for people they're going to have these like old relation
39:07
romantic relationships from the past that were really worldly and so much sin
39:13
and then that person just kind of um left your life exited your life so it's
39:18
okay it's not like unloving to like remove the person as a as a Facebook
39:25
friend um in most cases I'm just giving this General wisdom for um for many
39:32
situations that some of you will have um so and same for like following on
39:39
Instagram um now like there can be a lot of people
39:47
from your past that you know it's if you see them once in a while on your
39:52
newsfeed it's not bringing a distraction it's not this open door for the end
39:58
um and that that's that's fine to leave them there that's good to leave them there because they're fish they're fish
40:07
that God's calling you to throw out the net and catch you know Jesus said to
40:12
Peter the disciples I'm going to make you Fishers of Men and so um all of the
40:19
people from your past from your present there's a bunch of fish there tons of
40:25
fish there and he's calling you to throw your net out and some of them not all of
40:30
them but some of them will come in the net um and some of them many of them
40:36
seeds are being planted so many of them like from your
40:42
past they are not liking anything they're not commenting anything you have no idea that they're watching but
40:49
actually seeds are being planted little by little transformation is coming they
40:55
are being drawn to Jesus their eyes are opening up people from your past many of
41:01
them they might have already received Deliverance they might have already come to Jesus and just not told you but it
41:08
happened through the posts you were sharing absolutely
41:16
Hallelujah someone has been prayed over multiple times for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and it's never happened do you think it's because they need
41:21
Deliverance first when it comes to baptism of the Holy Spirit many times we are focused on like
41:27
come you need to speak in tongues you need to speak in tongues like we can be very like forceful about it but
41:33
sometimes baptism of the Holy Spirit can be similar I similar to other Miracles that manifests later where you received
41:39
the spiritual deposit you received the fire of the Holy Spirit you were baptized in the Holy Spirit but the
41:44
speaking in tongues manifestation doesn't happen immediately that can happen for people
41:50
sometimes what will the answer of what how to see it manifest is by just
41:56
continuing to seek God continuing to surrender continuing to put your eyes on him continuing to be more spiritual less
42:04
carnal just just keep on seeking him in these
42:09
ways be where God's power is and it will manifest the speaking of tongues will
42:16
manifest but it's not supposed to be something that we force or we're trying to figure out or like I don't know
42:23
what's wrong with me it's not it's I mean everything in God's kingdom it's
42:28
not supposed to be this like forced thing it's supposed it's we've received so much of we've received already but in
42:36
our faith in obedience we see the full manifestation come so when the power of
42:41
God is there faith is When Faith is there just rest we don't need to try to
42:48
like figure out what is it what do I you know searching searching
42:54
searching at this when you have these things now just rest keep seeking keep
43:00
surrendering keep being obedient just rest it'll happen it'll it'll manifest someone in the office of a
43:07
prophet gives a word to the whole body of Christ is that word really only for
43:12
their sheep so there are some people who call themselves there are some people
43:18
who are called by God there a true Prophet who was called by
43:23
God when they speak something it's for who they are speaking to like
43:28
if they are saying this is for the body of Christ then it's for the whole body of Christ but that's when God has truly
43:36
called them to be a prophet um you know and and and and then there's different
43:41
levels of prophets like my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy he is at the highest level of prophet can
43:50
be um and he's truly a general in the body of Christ and so when he's you know
43:58
God sent him from Tanzania East Africa to Los Angeles and God sent him here for this
44:06
reason to prophesy as a prophet in the body of Christ for the whole world
44:12
because God is about his whole world not just one country and so you know Moses was sent
44:21
from a foreign land to prophesy to the Israelites
44:27
um many times we see PE Jonah was sent from a foreign land to prophesy to a
44:35
different Nation this is what God is speaking for all of you anyways God sent
44:41
him to America in well 2016 is when he
44:46
prophesied my calling but in 2017 God he ministered in La he
44:52
ministered and at a a conference I put on and I invited him to speak and to
44:58
minister and but he said that God s when he was there ministering he said God sent me
45:05
to prophesy to all of you to the people of America that God has heard your prayers
45:13
for Revival and God has answered them Revival is now it is no longer the
45:20
time for praying for Revival Revival is now and God is pouring out Apostles and
45:26
Prophets to lead this revival to be spearheading
45:33
this revival to be releasing what has been missing in the
45:38
body of Christ in this revival and nothing I repeat nothing can
45:45
stop this move of God that's what he prophesied and so when he prophesied
45:50
that he was prophesying that for all of America well actually the whole body of
45:55
Christ but God had planned to start the Revival in
46:01
LA and have it spread across the nation and across the whole world and that's exactly what's happened that's literally
46:07
exactly what's happened so um he prophesied this to
46:12
America and to the whole world but he was prophesying to America like this is where God is starting it God has heard your prayers this is where he's starting
46:19
it um so he prophesied that for the whole body of Christ it was not for one
46:25
church it was not for just for like his it wasn't even for his church his church is in Tanzania East
46:31
Africa um it was for the body of Christ in America and the whole world but yeah
46:39
what are the most important actions we can take to Humble ourselves I have a whole message how to
46:45
be humble I think it's called how to be humble and that one is from a a little while
46:52
ago but then I have a recent message the power of humility the danger of pride so
46:57
there I really go into that question because that question is a a long answer but I want to answer
47:07
actually I want to give something though with that the holy spirit's leading me just just one one thing we can do one
47:14
thing you can do to be humble right now um one of them is to to Really carry in
47:20
your heart the fear of God that you you do not ever want to be out of his will
47:28
we shouldn't we shouldn't live in fear like what if I mess up I don't want to be out of his will oh what if I make a
47:36
mistake today and we God never wants us to live in fear but he does want us to
47:42
live in the extreme seriousness like extreme
47:48
cautiousness of I my greatest desire the thing that
47:55
matters to me more than anything in the world world is to please God is to be in
48:00
his will is to not do anything even tiny out of his will that's what I care about
48:08
more than anything that is what's most important to me like when you carry that
48:14
in your heart and when you live that not in a fearful way but in a fear of God
48:19
reverence way this is going to keep you humble
48:25
this is going to keep keep it it's going to help you hear conviction because God's going to be bringing conviction
48:31
always he's going to be bringing conviction he's going to be speaking in a still Small
48:37
Voice um that's not right uh I don't
48:42
think you should do that you know you you'll feel those like thoughts like there's something off about this uh this
48:50
feels wrong like you'll you'll have those like little unctions of conviction
48:55
and when you carry that fear of God in your heart you won't be quick to dismiss
49:00
them but if you don't carry that so seriously in your heart you can be quick to dismiss them those thoughts can come
49:09
but then a prideful thought can come of like no like a justif a justifying
49:16
thought um a thought that's like
49:22
uh based on based on worldly knowledge
49:28
a lot of wisdom that God has given us is like common sense but there's there's some things that seem Common Sense based
49:35
on our past knowledge not based on the new
49:43
wine so that's so important to
49:48
remember we can be so built up with we I mean we accumulate so much you've
49:55
accumulated so much knowledge and past you've been a Believer for a while you've accumulated a lot of knowledge
50:01
about how to do this about how to do that about how to do this about how to do that about how to do ministry about how to pray for people about you've
50:08
accumulated a lot of knowledge and the thing is when you come into the new wine you got to constantly
50:14
remember I'm a baby you got to constantly remember there's a lot that I thought was
50:22
right that isn't that there's a lot I thought
50:27
this is how you do it but that's not the new wine you know
50:33
you you you you got to carry that in your heart you got to carry that childlikeness in your heart being
50:40
teachable in your heart all right and so but if you don't do
50:46
that there might be these there'll be these convictions that will arise ah there's something feels wrong I wrong
50:54
about this I don't know and and then all of a sudden there will be a a prideful
51:00
thought a prideful thought maybe it won't feel prideful but a prideful thought that comes no this is how you do
51:06
these remember this is this is what you've known to be this is you know the knowledge from the past thought
51:13
Knowledge from the past thought comes and it dismisses the the
51:21
conviction from God so when you come into the new wine
51:28
and you're you've been confounded by God and humbled like wow there's so much I
51:33
didn't know there's so much I had wrong there's so much religion in me um man I
51:39
am I become like a child before you Lord I become
51:45
teachable care you got to remember this always you got to remember this always not forget it not forget it you know you
51:54
got to keep that in your heart keep that in don't go back to the old ways keep
51:59
that in your heart hallelujah hallelujah um that has been something
52:05
that God has really taught me it's a this aspect of humility that so many
52:11
people miss so many people Miss it's having to do with the inner
52:19
heart it's having to do with this desperation to be in God's Will and
52:26
please him it's something that people don't realize
52:33
when God's looking for humility he's looking for
52:41
this so um so yeah do not just dismiss
52:48
those little convictions those little still Small Voice convictions that you know are coming from the new wine you
52:56
know you can know when that conviction is coming from the new wine you know when it's this like
53:02
this you wouldn't have had this conviction before the new wine that's
53:07
when you know that's when you can have confirmation ah man this is time for me to slow down
53:15
and not hastily go out of God's will this is time for me to slow down and make sure
53:21
I'm making the right decision that pleases God in this
53:28
amen hallelujah when in doubt
53:33
