if I'm in a situation that used to trigger me into Panic thoughts start to take over and I can't declare out loud
0:07
how do I not cower down but have Victory um the first thing is to you
0:14
know daily regularly be renewing your mind and so that your your thoughts can't take over
0:22
you you know like the devil can try to bombard all he wants but thoughts
0:28
literally that the that the devil brings cannot take over when you become strong in the
0:34
spirit you truly have power over attacks
0:39
of the devil in any way over attacks in your mind and so um you know being
0:46
spiritually mature being in the word meditating on the word um being fed spiritually like being
0:54
on this live for example now receiving these teachings um being serious about being planted coming to to church regularly
1:00
applying the words um these are all big parts of what it means to be
1:06
spiritually mature and when you're doing these things your spirit Man rises these are just some of the ways
1:13
that makes your spirit man to rise but the some of the big ways and your flesh
1:19
is pushed down and so when the devil then comes to attack in your mind um
1:25
because your spirit is strong the devil isn't able to take over he isn't
1:31
able to win because you have been changed because your spirit man is
1:36
strong uh so it's kind of like you recognize this lie and you just see it for what it is instead of this battle
1:45
like you thinking this lie is truth and then you want being like Oh No but I
1:50
remember God said this it's not a back and forth like deliberation it's like
1:56
when the Devil comes in your mind you're just you immediately know it's a lie it
2:02
it it's like for me I for many years ago I used to struggle with the voices of condemnation the voices of religion
2:08
condemnation and shame in terms of um like sh shame that I wasn't doing
2:15
enough Christian religious activities reading the Bible enough praying enough things like that and so once I was freed
2:20
of that and once I became stronger in the spirit the devil would really back
2:26
really backed away but then sometimes he would randomly come I remember one time I actually read like
2:33
a a religious book like after I had already been free of this and it was
2:42
like it was like this author was writing basically like you need to do
2:47
this and you need to do this and you need to do this and then the anointing comes and just like full of religion and
2:54
things that I wasn't doing but I knew it was right that I wasn't doing it in this way type thing
3:00
but all of a sudden the condemnation voices I heard but they didn't have power over me
3:08
I immediately recognize them like this I I already know the truth um th this I
3:14
know what's going on here and so it it it doesn't like bring you down or make
3:21
you defeated but you just you see it for what it is you don't let it take over
3:26
you and you win so really answer is to be spiritually mature because whenever
3:32
these thoughts that are really sent from the devil come they you know their lies
3:38
it's no longer a back and forth battle and if you're in a place where
3:44
you can't speak aloud it it doesn't even matter like you you don't even really have to declare out
3:50
loud this is the truth because you are so firm and rooted in the
3:56
truth so um meditate on the word of God God meditate on the truth and renew your
4:02
mind and renew your mind to these to to what God has set you free of so that
4:08
you're strong when the day comes when the devil might try to come back in these
4:14
ways if you can't speak aloud somewhere you can you can always probably whisper
4:20
or mutter under your utter under your breath or go to the bathroom and speak aloud like if you're really in a war
4:27
because your the power of your tongue is so Mighty if you're really in a spiritual war where you need to reject with your
4:35
mouth and speak aloud and declare you can at least utter under your like speak
4:42
quietly you can go to the bathroom you can find a way to
4:48
speak when it's needed how to overcome lust in the eyes
4:53
even after renouncing so lust lust um a a big part of lust
5:01
actually has to do with renewing the mind um because lust many times can be
5:09
like the devil bringing thoughts it can be a demonic Spirit but it's one of
5:15
those things of the mind like a lot of the things in the mind um the stronghold is gone the spirit is gone after
5:22
Deliverance but the thoughts can still be there uh because you this comes the
5:29
these thoughts come out by renewing the mind because the devil attacks everybody
5:35
outwardly sending thoughts and lies some people can have demons inwardly um also sending thoughts lies
5:44
de um demonic emotions but the difference is is when it's inward demons no matter how much you go into spiritual
5:51
warfare and reject the devil's lies and declare the truth and renew your mind no
5:57
matter how much you do that those thoughts will not go away like it is a
6:02
stronghold it is bondage you just need the anointing to destroy the Yoke but but but then when one is set
6:09
free the devil can come outwardly like attacking outwardly sending thoughts
6:15
lies um emotions from the devil but now you have the power to reject them the
6:21
Bible says resist the devil and he must flee submit to God submit to God's truth submit to when it comes to lust like
6:28
he's commanding you to not lust after people um you know to Only Have Eyes For
6:34
if you are um if you have a spouse for them in that way right so um the Bible
6:43
says that so we're submitting to God this is what God wants me to do submit to God resist the devil I reject that
6:49
thought that uh impure emotion thought feeling and I declare that I am pure you
6:58
declare God's truth um the it's not like it's not like this
7:04
immediate thing sometimes where you you reject the devil and you never hear the thoughts again but it's over time as you
7:12
keep rejecting the devil's voice you're really you're really making it clear I
7:19
don't want this in my life I don't want lust I don't want these thoughts and emotions where prior you might not have
7:25
done that and so it's kind of the action of of accepting these thoughts and
7:30
emotions so now once the devil has seen you walking in your Authority I don't
7:36
want this over time he literally cannot bring these thoughts emotions
7:43
back yep so um this is the answer to this question how to overcome less than
7:49
the eyes even after renouncing uh renew your mind that this isn't you that you
7:54
don't want this renew your mind to this truth that the devil can send these thoughts and emotions it doesn't mean
7:59
that you have this impure heart but these thoughts emotions just come from
8:05
the enemy um many times so you know don't condemn yourself renew your mind
8:11
and also use the power of your words to reject these thoughts keep keep on going
8:17
keep on rejecting keep on speaking aloud and keep on and make sure that
8:24
you're closing every door and you're putting your eyes on the things of God
8:29
only you're never letting your eyes go elsewhere what can we do when our child
8:35
is being attacked by another parent outside the house specifically being told that God's new move isn't
8:42
real well they shall know them by their fruits the Bible says and the Bible says
8:49
that we must be like a child to enter into the kingdom and that the kingdom of
8:54
God belongs to the children so that being said the
9:00
the scripture that says they shall know them by their fruits does apply to children like children can know them by
9:06
the fruits children can see in the spirit discern in the spirit children um you know it's I've
9:15
seen it so many times in the ministry just children really understanding the things of the
9:21
spirit really being mature and wise in the spirit more than adults lots of
9:26
times actually because of their childlikeness their purity their humility uh adults have so many other
9:34
things going on they got religion going on they got Pride going on they got selfishness going on they got skepticism
9:39
going on and these like they've they've gone through stuff in
9:44
their life and they have that now in them and so when they see a real move of God lots of these things actually hinder
9:50
them from really being able to see in the spirit so children children literally don't have all these major
9:56
blockages of what keeps people from seeing in the spirit seeing the
10:02
truth so don't worry just rest and relax
10:07
and just be real with your children like share them what God is doing share with
10:13
them the Miracles the testimonies share with them how your life has been changed
10:21
and you can even teach them in the the biblical principles like even like the things that I teach you can share with
10:27
them like how to just what's really true and how some people don't have eyes to see it just like in the times of
10:35
Jesus and they will be able to see the truth they will be able to know so
10:43
um Jesus says my sheep hear my voice they know my voice so your children they
10:50
are pure they they are your children you have authority over them in the
10:57
spiritual realm and and so that they are God's sheep and they'll know his voice
11:02
so don't worry rest just let God move
11:07
through you as you love them and speak the truth
11:14
amen how should a Christian respond to the feeling of being personally
11:20
disrespected whenever you as a Believer are disrespected are persecuted are falsely
11:28
accused are um spoken against all of these things
11:35
whenever that happens to you it's a great opportunity a great opportunity to
11:42
grow to grow more spiritually mature you know Jesus was a man of no
11:50
reputation and God wants us to get to this place where we have died to our
11:55
ego where when things like this happen we don't take offense
12:02
we our whole life is just about Jesus our whole life is about serving Jesus
12:07
our whole life is about pleasing Jesus our whole life so our our life is not
12:13
about pleasing oursel our life is not about being respected you know our life
12:20
is not about getting approval from people and being treated right but it's simply about pleasing God and serving
12:26
him and the Bible makes it very clear that
12:31
persecution hatred false accusations disrespect rejection
12:38
comes with being a follower of Jesus and the more spiritually mature you are the
12:44
more anointing you carry the more that God has entrusted you with the more this will happen the more
12:52
this will take place I mean literally like like me I deal with that every
12:57
single day I'm I'm on social media looking at comments and um I'm I'm
13:05
looking at everything right so I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing like disrespect hatred
13:13
false accusations just really horrible things being said really really really horrible
13:19
things being said to me every day like pretty much every single day and usually
13:26
multiple times per day it's just a part of my life and I've accepted that and I
13:32
know that it will increase it it like has it it's a good sign you know like
13:40
for it to increase like the the higher God takes you the more that that comes
13:46
but the good thing is is that we have Victory through Christ so the the persecution the rejection the
13:55
disrespect will never Trump uh the
14:01
the like the The Godly honor and
14:06
um the the the the the the people who receive you Jesus in
14:13
you God will take you through Seasons sometimes where it feels like the opposite it feels like it's more
14:20
persecution and rejection than it is acceptance but it's just Seasons I've
14:27
learned I've learned this and um it doesn't just because there's more like
14:34
love and honor and respect than rejection and disrespect and persecution doesn't mean that it's still it's like
14:41
easy to see it's still not easy to see that right but um it's just a part of it
14:49
and we just have to accept it and it's I I've seen it be a good thing for my
14:54
spiritual life where it's refined me it's helped me to die to my ego it's
14:59
helped me become more like Jesus more spiritually mature and just be it what
15:05
it does is it gets all offense out of you so like it's it's really hard for
15:11
you to be offended because you've been so refined in that area it's been like like hate or disrespect persecution
15:19
like coming at you and time and time again you just keep looking to Jesus
15:25
when that time comes uh rejecting lies of the de that are coming through that Renewing
15:32
Your Mind blessing and loving your enemies sometimes that means by just keeping quiet and by not thinking bad of
15:41
them and speaking bad of them you know every time you see it you don't go into this place of like oh you are going to
15:48
get something bad coming to you for you doing that and I hope you do no you don't do that like every time you just
15:55
see it and you're you just are like it is what what it is and you have nothing
16:00
bad in your heart towards that person and you come to the place where you how
16:07
you you just want them to know Jesus you want them you know that they their eyes
16:12
are shut and you know that their life must be miserable right so you see spiritually and see like how Jesus saw
16:22
Apostle Paul when he was Saul that's where God wants to take you where you're seeing things so different
16:29
you're seeing things so selflessly selflessly seeing how God sees that's where God wants to take you and the way
16:36
he takes you there is bringing you through this bringing you through that that disrespect and all that that happens to you when someone is paying
16:44
the price to carry the anointing who are they paying God or the
16:50
devil well when we say when we say that there is a cost that you have to pay the price
16:57
to receive the ano it definitely does not mean like a
17:03
transaction and you like you know you want Power this is a dream a dream job or
17:10
something you want to do Miracles and so just like going to
17:15
college the tuition you cough up the funds for it and you pay the price and
17:21
when it comes you earned it oh no it's it's not like that at all at all so we
17:27
got to be careful first of all that we you know don't misunderstand the the saying the principle of the cost of the
17:35
anointing that you have to pay the price really what it means is well
17:41
you're not paying the devil that's for sure we're not getting anything from the Devil the devil isn't the one that has the anointing we're not getting anything
17:48
from the devil we're getting everything from God we're receiving everything from God the anointing comes from God and
17:55
paying the price um really what it means to just
18:00
summarize that is to be TR you to receive the anointing
18:06
you have to be transformed into the image of Jesus you have to look and be so much like him not like Jesus himself
18:15
but get pretty close you know and the Bible says be perfect as as god is
18:21
perfect and so when I when I the really the Revelation from that is that we we
18:27
can keep on going there's so much more so so often times we
18:33
um we separate Jesus so much from us like we're like well God's God you know
18:39
but we don't realize like how much more God can do us can do in us so we really
18:45
can look and be so much like him and so um it's really possible the
18:52
Bible talks about there's a scripture in the Bible that talks about how the commands that God's given us he hasn't
18:59
made it difficult for us to follow them and this is true like when we're
19:04
actually set free from demons and when we have the power of God in our lives to
19:09
help us it and will just simply make the choice to live a surrender life it's
19:16
really not that hard to follow God's commands to live purely to shut doors
19:22
and so for God to release the anointing God needs his servant his vessel to be
19:30
so much like him and to be truly pure the standard for Purity is so low
19:37
these days in the church um and a lot of the reason is
19:43
because that PE that that people having demonic oppression is just so prevalent and so you literally cannot live a Pure
19:50
Life if you have a demon because what they're doing is they're controlling you for making you
19:56
sin that's the issue for most people for most people the reason why they don't live a Pure Life and so we see this with
20:02
Christian leaders we see Christian leaders falling because the standard of Purity has been so low it's been like
20:09
acceptable and people think there's no other way they just have to hide their
20:14
sin they don't know what to do demonic oppression they need Freedom right so anyways for God to release the anointing
20:22
the standard of Purity is very high this this I mean for you to receive the like
20:28
at a high level especially too you have to be humble through and through
20:34
pure-hearted through and through surrender to God through and through and
20:40
a place at a in in this place where you you will absolutely do whatever God is asking you to do every day you will do
20:47
it no questions asked so to get to that
20:53
place it's a process to become like Jesus is a process it it can't happen
20:59
overnight and the process of becoming like Jesus is going through a refining fire
21:06
you are refined you are refined of these impurities and that's what makes you to look shiny like Jesus so you literally
21:15
have to be brought Through The Fire And every believer has is brought
21:21
through the fire but when you really mean Your
21:26
Surrender God takes makes you at your word and and you know you you're really
21:33
at this place of God I'll do whatever and God chooses you to be an anointed vessel you will go through a refining
21:40
fire that's like that is not like a typical Christian's refining
21:47
fire those who walk in the anointing go on go through much heavier
21:54
extreme fire and um like I remember for my life
22:00
like those four and a half years I was in like the Wilderness time the refining fire time
22:05
especially um the attacks that I went through I had never gone through attacks like this in
22:11
my life and it was like it was really shocking um and it and what refines us
22:17
the most is is um like the things that are making our ego to die and making us
22:23
to really depend on God we have nothing else like
22:29
when people are mean to you backstab you jealous do things bad things like that
22:38
brings some serious refining when you go through that and that's what we see in the Bible we see Joseph's brothers threw
22:46
him in the pit this woman falsely accused him we see with
22:53
David Saul the king is chasing him trying to kill him so we see like
22:59
through through these examples in the Bible we see how there were these people
23:06
doing like horrible things towards the servant of God and that was their
23:11
refining fire and that's what made them to have a death of ego and made their
23:16
faith to grow and made them humble and stretch them so much and refine them
23:22
that's what happened with me I went through things like that I went through things that I've never experience for
23:28
like I didn't know someone could make up lies out of thin air and want to destroy
23:33
someone and want to destroy someone's Ministry I saw that happen towards my spiritual father and me and it was
23:41
shocking because like like for my spiritual father I've never seen anyone that's as much like Jesus as him and um
23:48
for me um I was so like pure in heart with everything you know and I've done
23:54
nothing um but but like try to help and
24:00
bring blessing to these people and this one person specifically um just made
24:07
lies up out of thin air and I it felt like a movie like it didn't feel like real life like you didn't you don't know
24:14
that people are capable of this especially people who call the themselves Christians I literally didn't know that I did not it was a rude
24:22
awakening you know it was um and it what but but but it was really the Bible come alive it was really the Bible come life
24:28
like how on Earth could Saul Who Loved David David was such a blessing to him
24:35
like he was helping H him win battles Saul was above him and and David
24:43
was helping win battles and so he's helping him but he gets jealous of David who's actually helping him he was David
24:50
was playing the harp and demons were leaving Saul so he was such a blessing to him
24:56
and he did nothing to him and all of a sudden he just gets so jealous that evil just takes over him
25:03
now he's literally trying to kill him sending armies against him trying to kill him
25:08
literally physically kill him same with Joseph's brothers Joseph did nothing and it was his own brothers are like we just
25:14
want to kill him we throw him in a pit and then we sell him to slavery I mean it's shocking right it's
25:21
like how can this be real but this really happened in the Bible this really happened and so when the uh anointing is
25:28
really there it brings out the evil of the devil like never
25:34
before you don't really realize how evil the devil is until you start walking in the anointing and the devil uses
25:41
people so it brings out the evil in people it brings out these like these
25:47
things they've covered up they say they love God but deep down there's other stuff going
25:54
on and they're willing to be used by the devil and do evil things just like Joseph's brothers and um King
26:03
Saul the Pharisees and um yeah so
26:11
so I went through that and then I think a lot of you know I went through something even way more difficult than
26:19
that that I went through um on like a larger scale on a public
26:25
scale uh it'll be like almost two years ago in like
26:33
February where once again the false accusations Lies made up of me
26:38
backstabbing um from people I knew who who were like like fake you know um fake
26:47
to me and um that was really hard that really it really hurt it really hurt a
26:55
it was not easy and it was like really shocking like I I saw I was I was just
27:00
so shocked that people could do such wrong things evil things um make up
27:06
things out of thin air I was really really shocked especially like with a level of
27:12
influence you know um it's one thing when someone doesn't have like influence and they do that but then that's another
27:18
level when people are truly being set free and being brought closer to Jesus
27:24
through a Ministry and then a person makes up lies and speaks against and
27:29
that literally leads people away from receiving freedom and people who receive
27:35
Freedom now they're they probably getting Demons back because now they're speaking against where they got free
27:42
from and that's one of the open doors that that can make like demons come back
27:47
you know so um that was hard and I remember my spiritual father when I went through that he he said to me there's a
27:55
cost to the anointing there's a cost the anointing and this is the cost of going
28:00
of going higher and what that really meant was what that thing that I went
28:06
through was the hardest thing I've ever ever ever been through and it was more of a death of ego that I've ever gone
28:12
through before to not care what people think about me to uh you know
28:20
not go and defend myself but let God defend me to not be consumed and
28:28
so so um aggravated that people are thinking wrongly about me and lies about
28:37
me to not let that take over me but be at peace trust God renew my mind stay
28:46
focused on the great work that God called me to do throughout all of this
28:52
and bless my enemies bless those who were doing wrong against me and speaking against me and not speak bad about them
28:58
at all but bless them pray for them I never had to do something like that on this extent right so I had to do these
29:06
new things difficult things stretching things that I never had to do before and that absolutely transformed me it
29:12
absolutely made me more humble it absolutely made my faith grow in God more as I saw
29:19
that he fought the battles and won them for me and brought me Victory you know
29:24
when it seemed like impossible it um made truly my my ego to die more
29:31
than ever before to not um be consumed or care PE what people think and be
29:37
people pleasing but only fear God and please
29:43
God it transformed me completely so you have to go through difficult
29:50
things that are just difficult as humans because it's like Supernatural what God
29:56
is calling us to like to die to Your Ego to not um like defend
30:04
yourself to not care about what people think when they're thinking so wrong about you Injustice that's been
30:10
happening to you and you not to like do something to try to bring back Justice for yourself like that's not natural
30:17
that goes against human nature so you're not born with this you're not born with these Supernatural
30:25
qualities of the heart you're not born that way even if you're born a Believer
30:32
so to get to this Supernatural place where you have this supernatural character Supernatural heart it's like
30:41
Jesus you have to go through these hard things refining
30:46
fire and it hurts refining fire hurts super
30:52
uncomfortable it is stretching it is true refining fire and so so when we
30:58
talk about the cost of the anointing the price we're talking about the stretching
31:03
the uncomfortable things that transform you from being uh natural to
31:09
Supernatural to being like a normal person someone who calls himself a
31:14
Christian to a servant of God who is so much like
31:21
Jesus who truly has become one with Jesus they are
31:28
Supernatural not just with the power that they release the power they carrying that they release but their
31:34
heart is Supernatural their mind is Supernatural like the mind of Christ Supernatural how
31:43
they see things how they see people the eye their eyes are
31:49
Supernatural right so that's what the cost means so you I
31:56
mean you can say that you are um paying the price to God but really just that
32:03
means you are surrendered to God and you are willing to do what you have to do
32:10
and go through what you need to go through to be who God wants you to be
32:16
it's no kind of like transaction or anything like that it's just like I'm
32:22
entering into boot camp for you Jesus I'm I'm going through this for you and
32:30
that's it's it hurts it's stretching it's uncomfortable it's fiery hot like
32:36
ah sometimes but it's worth it it's worth
32:42
it and that's just one example that I gave by the way of what paying the price is there's so many different parts of
32:48
paying the price like I talked last week about um being stretched
32:56
financially and that was another area I paid the price for years and this was
33:01
like another area that was super uncomfortable but it had nothing to do with um like the devil using people and
33:08
all that it's different types of paying the price different types of refining
33:14
fire that you have to go through another huge refining fire area for me is waiting was waiting was waiting feeling
33:22
like you're in the middle of the desert and like having no clue where the promised land is and having no clue how
33:29
much longer you have to go and deep down feeling like it should have been here a while ago and it's not and that that
33:35
just uncomfortable feeling that was part of the the cost
33:41
too for my life there's a bunch of different areas of of what the cost of paying the price of what that means
33:47
showing up and preaching laying down my dreams of singing and showing up and preaching when I didn't want to do this
33:53
it was so uncomfortable for me I would like literally pretty much dread um
33:58
Saturdays preparing for service and Sundays and Sundays I mean it was so uncomfortable so that was the refining
34:04
fire stretching for me but all of these things I went through them and they passed they
34:12
passed it I'm through that now on the other side and then God brings different
34:17
kinds of refining fire along the way so we can keep going glory to glory becoming more and more like
34:23
him question if a stranger comes up to you and talks about their sickness do I
34:28
have the domain or authority to pray for them to be healed I get a lot a lot of that that come to me in
34:35
public um yes if this is what happens if a stranger comes up to you and talks
34:41
about their sickness and then you then share with them first of all you tell
34:46
them the good news so you preach that the Kingdom of Heaven has come near and then you demonstrate the kingdom of God
34:54
the demonstrate the power of God demonstrate you release the Kingdom
34:59
so uh it's important for you to share with them you know Jesus actually can
35:05
heal you and depending it it doesn't like it doesn't have to be a formula of
35:11
what you're saying but many times it's good to share how you've been healed how you've been delivered I once was like
35:17
this and then Jesus delivered me I went to a church where the power of God was
35:24
and this is what would happen in the Bible we don't see it much today today but it's here Jesus really is moving in
35:30
power today and I'm a testimony I have been healed uh for example or maybe they
35:37
share a certain oppression or sickness that they have and maybe you remember a specific testimony you've seen a video
35:44
of of someone being healed or delivered of the same thing and you can share that with them and can say you know what I've literally seen a testimony recently of
35:51
someone being freed of this and as you talk with them you then you can ask them
35:56
I believe God wants to heal you and free you do you would you like me to pray for you and I believe God would come through
36:03
and touch you and so you're you're making sure that they have free will and
36:08
then when they open up and they're like and they say yes then that then becomes your domain your
36:17
Authority so then you can pray for them if we kind of stutter while praying for
36:22
others does this look weak to the devil um the devil's not not
36:27
looking at how well you speak um he's looking to see if you actually have
36:34
anointing the demons are looking at that and if you know you have the anointing
36:40
and authority and if you use it properly and so it doesn't really have to do with
36:46
how you were speaking Moses had a stutter and God
36:51
wasn't like I'm going to make sure that you get rid of this stutter I'm going to make sure you go to speech there therapy
36:57
and once you get rid of this then you'll be ready no he used him even in this
37:03
weakness so um if you feel like you have a stutter this is a weakness but God
37:09
uses the weak and foolish things and Paul says I boast in my weakness because
37:14
then God's power comes and moves in that area and basic and paraphrasing and summarizing what he's meaning and it
37:22
becomes a strength it becomes Supernatural so when you have weakness
37:28
you need to understand that like everything everything all the gifts and abilities
37:34
and every part of you is Supernatural if you let God move through you so if you
37:41
have like a weakness it's not something separate like oh this part of me stinks is faulty
37:49
no this is a place where God's power will move through and it will be
37:55
Supernatural as God moves through this thing you know um for me public speaking
38:01
was my biggest fear and weakness and I really felt like I couldn't speak like off the cuff I could read scripts I
38:08
could act and sing with no problem um in front of people but like
38:14
speaking off the cuff I I just it was my biggest fear and weakness but this is what God called me
38:20
to do and now God has transformed me so it didn't look perfect at first when I first started preaching I don't like I
38:27
do today but God was still moving through that and still using that so it didn't matter if it didn't look like
38:32
perfect it was Supernatural and that's what matters is that it's supernatural what like like the speaking
38:38
was Supernatural even even if it wasn't perfect but it's supernatural
38:44
that's what matters God was moving through it that's what matters and then God will refine you and perfect you and
38:51
beautify you more and that's what that's what's happened for me like now God has
38:57
transformed me and with in my speaking and everything literally changed me and
39:02
changed that weakness to be like has helped has moved
39:08
in supernaturally and only by his grace and power has it is it now strength you know so um don't be worrying about what
39:15
the devil's thinking you what makes demons obey and respect
39:21
that respect to you and Obey is when they see the authority you carry so
39:27
if you stutter but you have authority they will go as praying in tongues more powerful
39:34
than declaring no they have different purposes so praying in tongues is one of
39:40
the ways that you you fan into flame your spirit man you strengthen your
39:45
spirit the Bible talks about how the gift of speaking in tongues it is to
39:51
edify your spirit so H it's one of the like tools gifts that God's given us to
39:57
push down our flesh and help the spirit man to arise you're also communicating directly to God in this language you're
40:04
not just speaking gibberish but you are literally praying you are you speaking God's
40:10
will but when it comes to walking in Authority in your domain this is time
40:16
for you you know when we speak in tongues first of all first of all when we speak in tongues many times you might
40:22
not know what you're saying sometimes you might interpret the tongues but many times times you don't know what you're
40:27
saying and that's fine that's actually it's part of the beauty of it is because it's just so based on faith is you're
40:34
just speaking in tongues out of like obedience out of obedience to God and with this faith that your spirit man is
40:43
rising is is is being edified and you are speaking to God directly it's just
40:49
purely out of Faith so it's like it's a beautiful mystery but we were called called to
40:56
walk in authority on this Earth and so to walk in authority we need to know God's Will and
41:04
then speak according to his will to walk in authority we can't just say let God's
41:12
will be done all the time we can't just be saying let God's will be done let God's will be done let God's will be be
41:19
done because we are given Authority um so like for example Jesus
41:25
says to the deciples when you speak to this mountain move and you believe that
41:30
what you spoke will happen it will move so Jesus is basically saying when
41:36
there's a circumstance where I'm calling you to walk in authority and make this mountain to move because that's my will I want this mountain to move maybe it's
41:43
this a demonic spiritual mountain in life right so he's saying that you
41:49
should use your Authority and take charge over that mountain and you know
41:54
God's will is to move the mountain so you you speak to that mountain mountain you must
41:59
move and then it will move so to walk in authority isn't to be like lofty like
42:06
let God's will be done let God's will be done Jesus didn't say just say let God's will be done it's God's will to be done
42:11
for the mountain to move but you need to be you need to be specific it's kind of
42:16
like uh there's sometimes when that the demons some demons especially like the
42:21
higher level demons they go when I speak their Nam specifically like sometimes
42:27
you will you will see you will see it happen even at fivefold church like I specifically a mass Deliverance time if
42:33
I speak specifically one kind of demon like Spirit of infirmity Spirit of
42:39
Witchcraft something like that you'll sometimes like hear demons scream with that word so being specific and precise
42:48
and walking in the authority um not like loftiness but speaking to
42:55
the the exact Mountain you move makes it to move so the speaking in tongues and
43:02
speak and declaring have different places but you can't um just replace
43:08
speaking in speaking in in in your language declaring with praying in tongues that
43:15
praying in tongues is to edify your spirit is not to walk in Dominion if a Believer doesn't speak in
43:22
tongues yet does praising and singing to God have the same effect in terms of strengthening their spirit and into flame so praying in tongues is one of
43:29
the gifts that we have to to Fan our spirit into flame to edify your spirit
43:36
it's just it's one of them though it's not the only one like the the Bible says
43:42
that faith comes by hearing the word of God your spirit to be lifted it it needs
43:48
to hear the word of God it needs Faith increase of Faith also so
43:56
you know you can't just like all you do is pray in tongues and that's all you do
44:01
and your spirit will be um edified no this is just one of the
44:08
ways um that we edify your spirit man so another way is listening like listening
44:13
to this word of God right now faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God and it's anointed where that you're receiving so just listening to the word
44:20
of God right now is edifying your spirit is lifting your spirit man so much strengthening your spirit man so so much
44:26
also reading the word meditating on the word of God also strengthens your spirit man also just meditating on Jesus being
44:34
with him praying with him singing to him focusing on him focusing on the things
44:41
of God spiritual things good things that edifies your spirit man to to to make
44:46
your spirit strong just means to be more spiritual to be more spiritual so all of these things um positioning yourself
44:54
with the anointing is to heal hear the word of God to receive the anointing upon you in your spirit that edifies
45:00
your spirit that makes you to become more spiritual spending time in the word spending time with Jesus that edifies
45:05
your spirit worshiping him focusing on him looking upon him making your
45:11
thoughts be turned to him always that edifies your spirit uh uh iron sharpens
45:16
iron uh being with uh likeminded Believers and and and thinking about
45:24
thinking about Jesus together talking about Jesus together fellowshipping together that edifies your spirit man uh
45:30
serving God doing the work of God there's something so Supernatural that takes place when you serve God like the
45:37
woman who poured out expensive perfume on Jesus's feet and she wiped the feet
45:44
with with her hair and and after she left that place she ended up smelling like the anointed one just directly
45:51
serving makes the anointing to come in your life more just directly serving makes you to become more
45:57
spiritual um I know um this this happened for me is when I just started
46:02
doing the work of God in the very beginning when I um was first walking in my calling and I just started serving
46:09
God and doing the work of God I I woke up one day like I don't know Weeks Later months later and I was like this is
46:16
crazy I'm so different like things just fell off me like I just naturally became more spiritual and this was in a a time
46:23
where like I was spending most of my time serving God things just fell off of me jeantal has a similar testimony like
46:28
just as she was planted and served just things fell off so that's when that
46:34
happens when you just Things Fall fell off of you of like
46:40
worldliness and um yeah you're just thinking more like God now and you don't
46:45
have the desires of the world that's that that's a sign that your spirit has risen that your spirit has become
46:52
stronger and stronger than the flesh so serving God so the these things that I'm saying right
46:57
now these principles these are all ways to edify your spirit man so if
47:03
you don't yet have the gift of tongues first of all if you're where the anointing is you can receive the baptism of Holy Spirit anytime anytime like I
47:11
I'm releasing the fire of the Holy Spirit like every service pretty much
47:16
and so just surrender to God hunger for him more of him and you will be baptized
47:22
into his holy spirit sometimes the gift of tongues doesn't happen immediately um but it will come the more that you seek
47:29
God so it's like for some people it happens immediately the gift of tongues but sometimes it it's been released but
47:37
it's a gift that needs to be unlocked still and it will become unlocked the more you seek God um deny your flesh
47:46
close doors and uh just keep surrendering and
47:53
it will come but if you're in that place yet where you haven't seen it come yet be unlocked yet you don't need to find
48:00
like a substitute or worry that you're like missing something like this is one of the tools to edify your spirit man so
48:07
it's it's important we use all of these tools we do all of these things that God has given us to edify our spirit man not
48:14
just choose our favorite one not neglect the others and that's important why I said we can't choose our favorite one
48:19
and neglect the others because you could be religious about praying in
48:24
tongues maybe like you you're so used to this like religious spiritual Act of you're
48:30
praying in tongues and it's you you you you think in your mind that you are the closest to Jesus when you pray in
48:36
tongues and you maybe it's in a religious way that you always praying in tongues like like I'm just going to sit
48:43
here and pray in tongues and I've accomplished my my duty today as a Christian and I can feel good about
48:49
myself now like if that's how you were praying in tongues and so you're praying in tongues to go to that that place of
48:58
I I've accomplished my religious Duty now and I can feel good with myself and not
49:03
shame then it's not edifying your spirit man number one because you're doing it out
49:09
of religion and number two it's keeping you from doing these other things that will actually edify your spirit man
49:15
these other things that God is calling you to do like you can be praying in the in tongues or just prayer in general for
49:22
like hours but it's religiously and meanwhile God wanted you to hear a word
49:27
that would change you God wanted you to serve him to serve him in his work to
49:33
advance his kingdom and you're not able to do that because you're stuck in religion in this
49:39
area so you need to be cautious of areas where religion is seeped
49:44
in and make sure you're walking in the spirit when it comes to you know obeying God doing these
49:51
things to edify your spirit what do you do if your spouse is not fully surrendered and his demons really affect and sadden you at
49:59
times so it's important you have strong faith that as you are connected
50:06
spiritually that God's grace is upon his life that
50:12
he's not just someone random out in the world um but but you know you are surrendered
50:20
to God you have the anointing in your life you are planted the covering of anointing is upon your life life and he
50:26
is connected to you in the spiritual realm so there's a special grace and
50:32
favor over his life because of you you take care of God's business and God
50:37
takes care of your business when you are serious about your surrender and serving
50:43
God and doing all the things in his principle like to advance his kingdom
50:48
sewing you're doing all these things God is taking care of all the things that
50:54
you care about and I mean of course God loves him be
50:59
more than you love him and wants this salvation for you for him but it's like everyone has free
51:05
will everyone has Free Will and so some people don't come to know Jesus till way
51:11
later in their life or never do but there is a Greater Grace that he has
51:18
it's like um I grew up with amazing Christian parents and so there was a Greater Grace
51:24
upon my life even though even though um God loves all of his
51:31
children equally he loves every single one of his children but the Bible says
51:36
you know raise the children up in the Lord and they will not depart from it so it's this principle like if you raise
51:42
your children in the Lord there is a special Grace that comes over them there is this protection from Over the enemy
51:49
that others don't have as much um so that similar principle because you're
51:56
connected in the spiritual realm you can rest and you should have believe and
52:02
have strong faith that they will come into the kingdom of God and I mentioned this in a past live you can do the
52:09
opposite of renouncing which is to to call them into the kingdom to declare I
52:14
declare my if it's your hus your spouse must
52:20
come out of the kingdom of darkness must come into the kingdom of God completely and Bee free in jesus' name and make a
52:29
sacrifice to God so a seed specifically for this putting more wait upon this uh
52:37
declaration that you have this the spiritual act that you have given that you have done um
52:45
and and from there rest and just rest in God's timing know that God's working and
52:53
whenever the demons in the spouse are really affecting you and saddening you
52:59
as you said this is this is your time of this
53:04
is one of the ways that God is using God is bringing refining fire he's using
53:09
this right here right here he's using this as your refining fire he's using this right here this situation to refine
53:16
you to make you more like him this is part of the cost this is part of the hard Parts God's using it God he uses
53:23
different things for different people for what going on in life so um renew your mind to that and
53:30
know that this isn't for a waste like I'm not just miserable here going through this really hard thing and this
53:37
stinks no like realize that God is bringing Beauty out of this this isn't a
53:43
waste this is part of a cost of the anointing he can he's using it as you'll
53:48
become more like him through this and also make sure that you take this seriously you
53:56
I mean you don't let your guard down you realize this is serious spiritual warfare right now this is serious
54:03
spiritual warfare that you're going through right now um so you you don't let your guard down you you be at war in
54:09
the spirit meaning you're constantly rejecting the devil's lies you're constantly Renewing Your Mind you are
54:14
staying so strong in the spirit you're not letting the the devil to win so
54:20
though you're going through times that are definitely uncomfortable you're walking in Victory
54:26
be aware to that season that you're in it's like other people are not in that season other people that um are single
54:33
and living alone in their homes are not having to they're not living that kind of Life they're not having to have like
54:40
not let their guard down spiritually like in their own home the way that you are you're going through something
54:46
different so you have to realize that that you specifically have to be sharp in the spirit be on guard like you in
54:54
the home you are at War and that's okay God is with you and he's using this as you refining
55:01
fire can I cancel words of death my husband may have spoken if he doesn't do it yes oh yes yes absolutely like when
55:10
you once you are free once you are free like you are planted here where the
55:17
anointing is you are set free the curses have been broken off of your
55:22
life no curse can come you again as long as you are surrendered to Jesus you have
55:30
the covering the protection of this anointing the to be planted one of the important parts of being planted is it's
55:36
releasing Supernatural protection over curses over witchcraft over demonic
55:42
spirits from coming that's the difference between not being planted at
55:47
a church where God's power is there can be people who are you know really have
55:55
out against someone to bring them harm and go to a witch and cast a spell on
56:01
them and the person's a Believer but the curses can happen simply because the
56:08
power of God the anointing is not in their life bringing
56:15
protection I've seen this from from from people like pastors coming and saying
56:21
how there was witchcraft literally done to the pastor's wife I believe it
56:27
was but the anointing wasn't like there like as a covering over them and the the
56:35
curse really Came Upon them this is one of the reasons why so many people are oppressed it's not just that they're
56:40
opening up doors to Demons but there's there isn't Supernatural
56:47
power of God in their life in their church so you have um witches going in using true
56:56
demonic Supernatural powers and sending them against Christians who don't actually have the power of God in their
57:04
life the power of God because there's a difference between the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's
57:10
another indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the third indwelling is the anointing the anointing is what destroys the Yoke the anointing is the power of
57:18
God that makes demons to go it's the power of God that releases Supernatural
57:23
protection as well from Supernatural demonic Powers trying to come against
57:29
you so this isn't the case for every believer like but that there can be some
57:34
people that just really have it out against someone and go to a witch and try to do curses on some somebody who's
57:42
a Believer if they don't have the anointing they don't have that covering that's the covering is very important
57:49
it's a the same anointing that's making demons go is like a shield around a
57:55
Believer who's planted where the anointing is so the anointing is there to make demons go but also to cover
58:02
supernaturally cover and protect the Believers the people
58:08
from curses witchcraft being done to them as long as they keep doors shut you have to
58:15
keep doors shut if you open doors it it it's um negating the covering it's it's
58:22
making the covering to not be there you have to surrender to God and follow his principles for that covering to be
58:31
there um so anyways like if a person is speaking words of death over you and as
58:37
long as you're surrendered to God you are planted the anointing is covering you the power of God is covering you in your life you have don't have anything
58:45
to worry about you don't need to worry like oh I might be cursed now they spoke these these negative things about
58:53
me oh my gosh I mean how many times do I see that a day happen to me like in on
58:58
social media and everything and people doing it behind the scenes I don't even know about but can't touch me it can't
59:04
touch me and um what you should do whenever a curse is spoken over
59:10
you uh people speak something bad against you just reject it just reject it say I
59:17
reject that in Jesus name that's all you have to do simply I reject
59:22
that that's it that's it and you don't have to worry at all that's gone it
59:28
never came upon you it can't touch you equally yolked can you talk more
59:35
about what it means to be equally yolked yes so there's a scripture in the
59:41
word that says how we should be equally yolked which means a couple things so
59:48
it's talking about here for marriages and also close friend
59:55
friendships so for marriage God ideally and this doesn't always
1:00:03
happen because eyes are opened up later in life and but God has Grace and he
1:00:10
brings Miracles through all of all of it when sometimes when you're not unequally
1:00:16
yed but ideally God
1:00:22
wants a man and woman to marry each other only when they're equally yolked
1:00:28
that's what God wants you become one equally yolked
1:00:35
means spiritually like you are at the same spiritual level it has to mean number one you are both Believers it has
1:00:42
to mean so so this idea of like I'm going to date him and date him or her
1:00:48
and save him that's not biblical that's not what being equally
1:00:55
yolked you shouldn't date unequally yolked because you should be if you're dating it's for marriage not just to
1:01:01
have fun and to have company and not be lonely or something if you're dating it
1:01:07
should be for the purpose of marriage so when you date it should be equally
1:01:12
yolked um so equally yolked means the same level
1:01:19
spiritually uh basically like it should it should mean that you are both
1:01:24
surrendered to God if you're not surrendered to God you don't have business getting married doesn't mean
1:01:31
that people don't do that but like like ideally what God would like before marriage occurs it this is this would be
1:01:39
the perfect will of God is a personal relationship with Jesus
1:01:44
surrender on in one own's life for Jesus to fill every void himself for you to be
1:01:51
um fully known and loved by God and your identity is in Jesus completely and you
1:01:57
have a strong relationship with God yourself and you you are not lonely
1:02:03
because you have Jesus and you've you've learned how to make him your best
1:02:08
friend greatest lover of your life and you've renewed your mind to know and to
1:02:16
experience his presence always that he's really with you always never leaves you and so now you are spiritually mature
1:02:23
that's a place of being spiritually mature and you um now you would be at a place where you
1:02:32
are ready to be married once you get to that place not saying like once you
1:02:37
reach that place it's time to get married no God has different timelines and not everyone's called to be married
1:02:42
at the same time but God has different timelines but you need to at least get to that place I'm talking about ideally
1:02:49
perfect scenario of that God would like for you I'm so I'm speaking now to like
1:02:55
the singles right okay so um like if you find yourself like really
1:03:02
wanting to have a boyfriend girlfriend spouse you feel like you really want
1:03:08
that because of another reason like because you don't want to feel lonely
1:03:13
because You' just had this dream for so long and you're just ready for this dream to come now because everyone else
1:03:19
is doing it because you feel pressure from family um because
1:03:25
you want to start having kids um because you care what other people
1:03:31
think and it's going to make people think better of you or something if if any of those reasons are the the the the
1:03:36
reason behind why you want to get Mar uh start dating and get married then you're
1:03:41
not ready yet you're not ready yet you need to you need to become more
1:03:48
spiritually mature surrender more to God everything and let him work in you and
1:03:54
and fill every void and allow this relationship with him to be
1:04:00
concrete strong mature so ideally it would be two people
1:04:07
who are at that place whose eyes are really opened up who are accepting like
1:04:12
surrender really means accepting of Jesus coming in however he wants so that means accepting him coming in power
1:04:18
casting out demons moving in new ways accepting to all of that
1:04:24
not like the fake surrender but deep down religious fake surrender but um full of
1:04:33
Pride not that we're talking about real surrender pure
1:04:38
heart that's that's the kind of marriage that God wants you to have and so that
1:04:45
you would both be that way that would then be equally
1:04:51
yolked unequally yolked would be like one person is surrendered to God has a
1:04:56
strong mature relationship with God is content with just God is only opened for
1:05:04
dating and marriage because it's God's will only that's why that's the real reason behind a real purpose behind it
1:05:11
but then the other person maybe they have other motives they aren't fully
1:05:16
surrendered they want to date because they don't want to be lonely anymore things like this so then you're
1:05:21
unequally yolked and then that is the reason why God doesn't want that
1:05:27
to happen is because it's for the person that is surrendered it's like bringing
1:05:33
them it's like they're holding them back from living like a full surrendered life to God and it and it brings like
1:05:43
unnecessary Warfare and like God wants the person to be able to serve him with
1:05:51
nothing holding them back and able to live fully surrendered every day every day every day and when God says do this
1:05:56
you're able to do this do this do this do this but then when you're Mar married you become one and so you can't really
1:06:03
just go off and do whatever you are one with that person you have to work
1:06:08
together so um when that person is trying to pull you from doing what God's
1:06:14
calling you to do that's inhibiting you from doing completely what God has called you to do so that's why it's
1:06:23
ideally God wants to be equally yolked for marriage this this also applies to
1:06:29
friendships in terms of really close friendships in terms of who you bring in close as Jesus only brought a few people
1:06:35
close he brought in um just a few disciples really close like we see these
1:06:40
same three disciples at the Mount of transfiguration and at the Garden of Gethsemane so there was 12 he brought
1:06:45
close and three he brought really close so these three would have been more
1:06:50
spiritually mature than the others so they were more equally yolked with
1:06:57
Jesus so when it comes to like who you're bringing in really close and having access to you and not having as
1:07:03
many boundaries um but they're like really close friends they should be equally
1:07:09
yolked or it's going to be the same scenario as I shared with the marriage that's unequally yolked they could be
1:07:16
pulling you back holding you back from doing exactly what God wants you to do in the fullness it also could be really
1:07:22
dangerous spiritually uh like a lot of unequally yolked Christian
1:07:28
friendships where it can be a serious danger is in today's time especially is you have a religious not really
1:07:34
surrendered maybe they have pride not Purity in the heart friend and maybe they're like kind of fake because
1:07:39
they're in church they're at church all the time they serve a church let's say just saying like any church in the world right and um so they seem like they
1:07:47
really love God but deep down they don't have a pure heart deep down they have a lot of religion and so then you have
1:07:53
this other person and your friends and you're hanging out all the time but this other person is actually pure in heart
1:07:59
is actually humble and the pure in heart shall see God so they see God they see God through the anointing they see God
1:08:05
through demons being cast out they see God as he moves through different kinds of vessels that we're not used to they see the new move of God the Revival and
1:08:12
they're like yes Lord and and want to serve God there but then this friend
1:08:17
then goes and is like a Pharisee and speaks against and speaks lies and then
1:08:23
then they've been friends for so long so that person with a pure heart can be
1:08:28
like pulled away can be deceived from doing what God was calling them to do
1:08:34
because of this Open Door of an unequally yolked close
1:08:41
friendship they they when you become close to someone you really give an ear to them you really trust them and so
1:08:48
some people are trusting people that aren't trustworthy and that's a real problem because you're listening to the words
1:08:54
they're saying and it's coming from the enemy it's the spirit of religion it's bringing
1:09:00
deceit I'm renewing my mind every day but fear is so familiar to me but now I've had enough of it I want it out is
1:09:06
there more I can do than renew my mind so AED and resist fear am I missing something so you said that fear is
1:09:13
really familiar to you so when something's really familiar to you when something has been familiar to you for a long time
1:09:20
like a certain kind of thought pattern has been this way for a long time or it used to be bondage it used to be the a
1:09:26
stronghold of the devil for a long time as I shared earlier some things in the mind some oppressions
1:09:36
that now become freedom of the Mind in the mind
1:09:42
sometimes it's a process before you see the thoughts completely gone but the
1:09:48
important thing is to realize that it is no longer a stronghold it is no longer a
1:09:53
demon it is no longer oppression that's all gone so the important thing for you to
1:10:00
realize is like the example of the animal with a
1:10:07
chain on its leg um tied up and then the chain was
1:10:13
like cut off but the but the animal doesn't move
1:10:19
it thinks it's still there the important thing to renew your mind is to realize that if if you ever hear thoughts of
1:10:25
fear coming to renew your mind and realize that right there that thought
1:10:30
used to have control over me but now I know it's a lie and it's it's
1:10:36
not in me it's lit in me this is just an outside outside noise like just just
1:10:43
annoying just annoying like instead of a a if if a demon is a is a fly instead of
1:10:52
that being in you and like like being literally inside you and bringing damage
1:10:57
and controlling to you to you now the fly is outside and it's buzzing in the
1:11:03
ear but it's not a part of you it's not touching you it's not inside of you it's just an annoying sound it's just an
1:11:10
annoying sound you have to keep on Renewing Your Mind to this
1:11:15
truth I am free this is not a part of me this is an outward lie I'm not going to
1:11:22
listen to like approach it with peace approach it not thinking like H I want
1:11:29
these thoughts gone just approach it with peace just walk in your Authority I reject that I reject that and thank you
1:11:35
Jesus for freeing me as I shared before sometimes when you have had oppression
1:11:41
in the mind you free many times the devil will try to attack outwardly
1:11:46
hoping that you'll be like that animal thinking you're still tied up right thinking you're still in bondage and he
1:11:53
he's hoping that like you'll open up the door by accepting the lies not rejecting them and then you get the demon again
1:11:58
and more demons so that's his strategy but he's powerless as long as you know the truth and you keep rejecting him and
1:12:06
so since that's the area of warfare for every believer is the mind um just just
1:12:13
just normal Warfare not demonic oppression normal Warfare because of that people who are people who receive
1:12:19
Deliverance in the mind many times are are feeling almost like am I really free
1:12:25
I don't know because it's so familiar sounding the the outward lies that are no longer inward it's a different
1:12:32
feeling of someone who had addiction they're set free and they no longer have a taste to it anymore it's when it's in
1:12:38
the mind it you always you can't skip the renewing the Mind process and the
1:12:43
more that someone has been oppressed with this sometimes it is it is not an
1:12:49
overnight thing but it's a however long the devil's outwardly attacking you just keep rejecting you
1:12:55
just keep rejecting and just keep trusting God keep trusting God you're in this process now of being transformed
1:13:02
completely different and so you're in the middle now but when you come out on the other side those thoughts won't be
1:13:08
there at all the devil won't be able to send those thoughts again anymore yeah approach it with peace seriously like
1:13:14
sometimes if I get a bad dream like I'll just wake up like I reject that like it's just like just don't let the devil
1:13:20
get to you you know you just accept this accept this the reality that we're in a spiritual war we just accept that
1:13:27
reality and we don't try to fight it we just have we don't try to fight the fact that we're in a spiritual war you know
1:13:33
we don't get annoyed with it we don't let it get us down right you realize
1:13:40
what what we're in we're warriors so stop trying to not be a warrior right and and just be at peace knowing you
1:13:46
have all the authority and don't let it get you down in your day just oh here I
1:13:52
got to go to work reject the lie and I'm on with my day with peace instead of ah
1:13:59
this is annoying this is happening again and you're exuding all this energy with your frustration and annoyance when all
1:14:06
you need to do you have the power you have the authority I reject this keep going keep going with what God's calling
1:14:11
you to do in that day keep your keep in your peace I completely abandoned my old friend group because they knew me as
1:14:17
Abram and I'm trying to be Abraham but some guilt remains did I do the right
1:14:22
thing by cutting them off you have to make room for the people
1:14:30
God called you to first of all you have to be at peace and not feel guilt when
1:14:36
God is calling you to put boundaries up you you can't stay with people that
1:14:42
are dragging you backwards and be who God called you to be you won't change you won't transform
1:14:50
so first of all that's why you need to put the boundaries up and not feel bad about it unapologetically God said to Abram Abram
1:14:57
leave the land leave all of your friends
1:15:06
behind it's biblical sometimes it is absolutely biblical to
1:15:13
literally leave behind the Abram friendships because you're going nowhere
1:15:20
with them they don't they cannot take you to where God has called you to be
1:15:25
they cannot they will hold you
1:15:30
back and I'm I'm talking about people who are not surrendered to God who have doors open up to Demons who would be
1:15:38
unequally yolked if you were to be close friends with them still they it would literally be the open door to the devil
1:15:44
in your life that would hold you back 100% something we need to take very
1:15:51
seriously and never feel guilty or ashamed about when it's God speaking leave this
1:15:58
land never feel guilty or ashamed that's the Devil he's really mad because he knows the power of you obeying God when
1:16:05
he says leave behind this old land and go to this new land I'm taking you devil is not happy about that that's why he's
1:16:10
bringing the voes of condemnation condemnation and shame he wants you to go back to Egypt he doesn't want you to go to the
1:16:17
promised land so I expose that lie of the devil in Jesus name
1:16:24
yeah and also as I number two God has called you to have iron sharpens iron
1:16:31
friends who will literally sharpen you and help help you P pull you forward instead of pulling you back and so you
1:16:39
we do not have capacity to have a million friends we only have capacity to have a certain number of close friends a
1:16:45
small number of close friends that's the only capacity we have so if you're feeling that capacity with people that are pulling you back you're also not
1:16:52
making room for the people that will pull you onward pull you forward sharpen you in the spirit and that God has
1:16:58
called you to assign assign to you to also pour into to sharpen them pour into
1:17:03
to um help pull them up so that you can actually do do works in the Kingdom
1:17:10
Advance the Kingdom so just be aware of this
1:17:17
religious condemnation voice that is from the
1:17:22
enemy it manifests in different ways like this it manifests in that area of
1:17:28
leaving behind the old friends that God is calling you to put the boundaries up on beware of this it creeps up in
1:17:33
different ways but beware of that familiar religious condemning voice that sounds like spiritual but it's from the
1:17:40
enemy beware of that beware of that not just in this area other areas it can creep in don't just be quick to believe
1:17:47
the condemning voice there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus it says on the word and I've had
1:17:55
to do that I had when I received my prophecy I had to do that I had to do that completely and it wasn't
1:18:00
comfortable they didn't understand did not understand but it was extremely
1:18:07
important extremely necessary to leave behind the Abram
1:18:14
life all that that included the people there
1:18:20
too it's weird it I mean the spirit of it's so unfamiliar especially cuz it's
1:18:25
not like taught about in church much um yeah so it's like so unfamiliar to
1:18:31
territory so it's it's I mean the devil many times does
1:18:36
bring that condemnation for us I remember even hearing that you know when it came to that yeah so just be aware of
1:18:42
that you're doing the right thing when God's telling you to leave a to leave
1:18:48
behind the land the Abram land
1:18:53
what if these friends godd is needed us to leave are people we work with put boundaries up and unashamedly this is an
1:18:59
area you just got to be strong and it's an area that feels um weird it does just because I'm
1:19:06
telling you this is not really taught in church like at all
1:19:11
much um yeah it's really not taught
1:19:17
much especially because like it's it's extra important when you're walking in the anointing because especially in the
1:19:23
church you find a lot of Pharisees and so like prior to the
1:19:29
anointing it just seems like everyone's United everyone's on the same page there's no harm in h having close
1:19:36
friendships with everyone that's in the church it can kind of feel that way of course it's not completely true but somewhat somewhat it's not as dangerous
1:19:44
but like when you are are your eyes are opened up to
1:19:51
the anointing now all sudden there's Pharisees when there weren't before before before Jesus there wasn't
1:19:56
Pharisees like weren't dangerous you know and so now when you believe in God's
1:20:02
power and you are walking in the anointing you're receiving the anointing in your life in the body of Christ
1:20:10
there's a whole lot of Pharisees and so to bring those Pharisees in close is super dangerous
1:20:17
because they're out to kill the move of God the anointing Jesus
1:20:22
and today times not as much physically kill but with words with kill Ministries that God's moving in kill with false
1:20:29
accusations and lies to try to bring people away to deceive them so it's
1:20:34
super dangerous so a big reason why it's not really taught much in church is because like it's not really an issue
1:20:41
until the anointing is here so that's why it feels strange and
1:20:46
unfamiliar to a lot of us CU it's got a new territory it comes with the anointing the um um ending of these
1:20:55
these wrong friendships comes with the
1:21:01
anointing so don't don't feel like it's not being loving or anything uh this is
1:21:07
biblical and you are loving you're loving them in a different way now by shining
1:21:14
your light like for me now I'm on social media I have so many of the old friends
1:21:19
are still like on the time on the Facebook still and people following me on Instagram still from way back in high
1:21:24
school and stuff and now they can some of them
1:21:30
probably might show up to a video someday or it's already happened maybe and they're they got delivered because
1:21:36
now the power of God's able to move through me but if I stayed close friends with them they could never get delivered
1:21:42
by the anointing moving through me you know like it puts into perspective this has to happen for you to even be able to
1:21:48
love them well and be a vessel of God for for them but the religious mind's
1:21:55
like I have to just people please and just stay close to everybody
1:22:01
and never put up boundaries to be loving it's religious and
1:22:07
wrong I want to declare over all of you right now I speak right
1:22:14
now every Spirit of religion to go from your life every nagging voice of
1:22:21
condemnation guilt and shame to go and may this word stay rooted in your
1:22:29
hearts how your eyes have opened up today may they remain open May it change
1:22:35
you how your eyes now see may you remember so when these voices of
1:22:41
condemnation come shame guilt religion when these come may you be able to
1:22:47
really spot them and know this is not truth This Is A Lie of the devil so that
1:22:52
you do do not accept it ever again you don't let it's important to
1:22:57
not let that lie in because it literally like slows you down in what God's
1:23:04
calling you to do that day like however he's calling you to however he's calling you to serve him it's like you're having
1:23:12
less energy and Abundant Life you're when you um go to love on someone or you
1:23:19
you've been a little bit depleted of the joy of the Lord word and so you're not able to be the
1:23:26
best vessel you can be when you receive these lies so don't take it lightly take this word seriously today and and grow
1:23:34
grow with God now become more spiritually mature and take this seriously like these thought don't don't
1:23:40
let guilt condemnation shame come these lies of the devil when when you did
1:23:45
nothing wrong is the truth when you actually did the right thing you did what God has asked you to do be confident in that when you know God
1:23:52
spoke you spoke to you to do something um and I speak strength to every one of
1:23:59
you strength in the spirit that you would be strong Warriors and that you
1:24:05
would be peaceful Warriors you would live life in peace not striving or
1:24:12
struggling or getting like super annoyed and distracted by the Devil by Warfare but
1:24:21
you are confident in Who You Are may you be confident in who you are bold strong courageous and Powerful in
1:24:27
Jesus I declare freedom for all of you freedom in the mind and I declare
1:24:35
abundant peace abundant joy to fill you in jesus' name may you go higher this
1:24:44
week may you be elevated to another level in the spiritual realm your spiritual maturity increase your
1:24:51
spiritual eyesight increase in Jesus name amen
