0:00
is it bad to have more virtual friends like 5f family for example that are all
0:06
across the world then in person I've been told it's bad but I
0:12
think it's the devil it's definitely the devil I
0:17
mean you know my spiritual father is across the world he is literally
0:24
physically as far away almost as you could get um but God chose him to be my
0:29
spiritual father and um there is nothing I'm lacking you know
0:36
spiritually because of the physical distance in terms of receiving from him receiving impartation receiving
0:42
equipping and everything uh there's there's absolutely nothing missing there's nothing lacking because there's
0:49
a physical distance and um in the spiritual the spiritual realm is the
0:56
most real thing the most real realm is it's the Physical Realm comes from the
1:01
spiritual realm so in the spiritual realm there
1:08
physical distance doesn't really matter in most in many cases of many things of course when it comes to times when God
1:16
wants to release impartation uh specifically for a
1:21
specific purpose specific season God does want you to get under the shadow physically like even like receiving
1:27
impartation for me I I traveled to my spiritual father's Church um multiple
1:34
times several times and I shared actually in the sermon this past Sunday of how when I one of the biggest
1:42
significant changes in terms of not really seeing the power of God to then all of a sudden seeing the power of God
1:47
flow through me happened after I went and received impartation physically um but I don't I didn't have
1:56
to be there like in the same city as my spiritual father every single day um it
2:02
was way more days that I was as far away as you can get physically than there were than there were physically in days
2:09
physically close um so yes the the physical location is important sometimes
2:17
like when God wants to do something specific right but um you know before
2:24
God decided to um unlock the anointing really and
2:30
and and release this revival movement that we've seen where all of a sudden demons started manifesting and leaving
2:37
people and Revival just spread all over the world um it wasn't like the that day
2:44
I I was physically with my spiritual father or something and received like this impartation it didn't matter that um you
2:52
know he was all the way across the world in terms of receiving impartation and of anointing in me uh so in the same regard
2:58
that's just an example of when we're talking about um like Godly relationships whether it is spiritual
3:07
mother and father to child to spiritual child spiritual son or daughter or
3:13
whether it's uh family in Christ iron sharpens iron as the Bible says so so
3:19
important we do have Godly friendships Godly relationships of so iron can sharpen
3:25
iron so what so when we're talking about those relationships too it doesn't matter if it's in in physical
3:34
life or like physical location or not um
3:39
that eventually God does want to bring you uh people close physically of
3:46
course sometimes maybe it's only needs to be one though you know um but there there can be Seasons where there is no
3:53
one close physically to you who is on that same spiritual level spiritual eyesight so serious about God surrender
4:00
to God part of God's Revival sometimes that's the case it's different for everybody it's really for for all of you
4:07
watching it's all it's a different case for each of you and but I will say that
4:13
God will bring people physically eventually and that's going to look different for some people I know there's
4:18
some people who are here now whom God actually called them to literally move
4:24
and be a part of fivefold church physically all the time that's what God wanted for some people and in the future
4:30
even some of you here that will be the case for you too but that's not the case for everybody um and so anyways that's
4:38
how God brought the physical uh the friends physically that were on the same
4:43
level spiritually um equally yolked so iron can sharpen iron um but for others
4:49
of you that's not the case and maybe right now you don't have anyone physically close to you that's okay so
4:56
really um that's carnal-minded to be like to think like um you need to have
5:02
more friends physically than that you're close to than than virtually um and and
5:09
and and and and and God is building his Revival Army right now he is building his Revival Army I was actually talking
5:15
about this yesterday um I was actually talking about this yesterday with uh
5:20
Jean tall I was just sharing about a lot of you who are here actually how I've seen like this beautiful shift where um
5:29
many of you have really grown in the spiritual realm and have gone
5:35
through training to be Warriors of God's Revival Army and you've that you know
5:44
that surrender and that equipping has led to a fire in you a Revival fire in
5:49
you where you're burning strong for Jesus and you you are saying yes to what
5:57
he's calling you to to be a warrior in God's Revival Army um and do what he's
6:03
calling you to do which is so hugely right now um spreading the word and and
6:10
and being so proud of him and being making it Priority to share about him
6:16
and what he is doing and being so loud and proud about Jesus and what he's
6:21
doing the opposite of ashamed you know and um I've seen this beautiful shift
6:27
recently where there's many of you that have really taken hold of this revival
6:34
fire and really have become so serious about your surrender and serving God and
6:40
spreading spreading the good news um I was even I even saw this beautiful shift
6:47
like in my in my DMs of people tagging me and there is this shift
6:54
where the fire for what God is doing is is like growing the passion is growing
7:02
I'm seeing a shift in many of you becoming more
7:07
mature um and really stepping up to the plate you know really stepping up to the
7:12
plate to Value what God's doing and continue to keep the fan uh the the
7:18
flame alive Fanning Fanning the Fanning into flame what God has released to you
7:25
continually um and I'm so proud of you all I'm so proud of you all many of you
7:30
who are doing this and um I'm literally seeing my own eyes many of you here how
7:36
Iron has sharpened iron uh you know it it's made fire to grow in EV in many
7:43
many of you warriors uh and it's been virtually it's been people across the world people
7:50
across the world and you know people being inspired there's uh so many
7:56
different translations now and there's an Indonesian translations the someone from Indonesia is is translating what
8:04
God is doing the videos there's there's uh Chella in in
8:10
France who's translating so many videos for the French people to receive there's there's
8:17
Miri Dagmar who's translating in Spanish what God is doing there's um
8:26
someone in Italy translating what God is doing and Beyond and um the reason why there has
8:33
been a growth of this spreading you know even different translations is is
8:39
because of the iron sharpening iron and the the you know this this revival Army
8:46
rising up and encouraging one another um and and sticking together you know so
8:54
uh the the what God is doing is so beautiful he's literally he he's like using the foolish things to confound the
9:01
wisdom of this world like it it doesn't make sense in the world's way how God
9:06
could build his Revival Army like this person over here and this person over here and this person over here and they
9:11
don't live in the same same city but God's using them so powerfully to stir
9:17
up one another and fan the flame and sharp iron sharpening iron it's so
9:22
beautiful and I praise God it's like something only God can do it's so beautiful Hallelujah
9:31
Hallelujah yes and merum um as well you know making these beautiful posts and
9:38
quotes every day so many of you so many of you some of you I haven't mentioned your names but I I see it all and I'm so
9:44
blessed how I'm seeing um so many of you keep your eyes on Jesus and stay focused
9:51
and and and be serious about being a warrior and sharing what God's doing and
9:57
testifying Hallelujah yeah valuing what God is doing it's like God is doing something
10:04
so so so precious and he has been doing something so so so precious and he wants
10:10
the world to receive him well he wants he wants his body to receive him he wants the body of Christ to receive him
10:17
him coming in a new way him coming through new servants him coming through
10:22
a way that we haven't seen before in our generation in the past generation him coming by his anointing him coming
10:29
coming through Apostles and through prophets him coming to make demons tremble and go and you know this is a
10:38
this is for sure this is something for sure that you need to know God wants his whole body to receive this this isn't
10:46
something that God is looking for just like one denomination to receive God wants his whole God is
10:53
asking his entire body of Christ he is asking every Le leader in the body of
11:00
Christ even those who've never talked about the power of God before he is
11:06
asking all of them to accept him in his Revival in his new
11:13
move in his new wine through his new vessels and the new thing he's doing he
11:19
is asking not just asking this is um he is he is commanding commanding this is
11:25
about obedience but he's commanding his body which has to really
11:32
mean his leaders the leaders to accept him and um the way that God is doing
11:39
this is it can't be through one person but it's going to be through the Army
11:45
and I'm seeing what's happening is this this Army you all that he's raised
11:51
up you are you are continuing to say you
11:56
are continuing to be like the Samaritan woman woman at the well like tirelessly you are saying like every
12:03
day this is what Jesus is doing look see and accept I glorify Jesus I praise him
12:10
I value what he's doing I will not be quiet about this come and receive what
12:16
our Lord is doing um through your testimonies through
12:22
sharing that's like the action of what you're doing and it's it's it's it's
12:28
making the f to grow bigger and bigger and constantly be there so that no one
12:33
can miss it and no one can have an excuse that they didn't see God's making sure it's being seen what he's doing and
12:42
he's doing that through his army it has to be done through his army through all of
12:47
you and God is using the weak and foolish things um to to Proclaim this to
12:54
wake up the world he's using the weak and foolish things like the Samaritan woman at the well like the the Samaritan
12:59
woman at the well it's like God gave her a microphone and said the Messiah is here Revival is now
13:08
this is what Jesus has done for my life look what he is doing come receive it's
13:13
like it's like Jesus gave s woman woman at the wall a microphone and um it could be heard
13:20
everywhere and that's what God is doing right now he's using like Unknown People weak and
13:28
foolish people um people like you people like me and you uh giving them a
13:34
microphone right now and Shining a light uh for the whole body to see for leaders
13:41
to see and um to make it known there's no doubt there's no question that this
13:46
is him and this is what he is not asking but commanding receive me in my new move
13:55
in my new wine in my new vessels so keep going I'm so proud of you all
14:02
keep going and increase increase increase
14:08
amen it it's like a fire that's growing and growing so more and more people will
14:13
be um inspired it's like one Samaritan woman at the well turns into five turns
14:20
into 10 turns into 15 turns into 20 turns into 100 turns into a
14:25
thousand Hallelujah and so the whole world is talking about what God is doing
14:31
they can't be quiet anymore I'm excited I'm excited I'm so
14:37
excited on this day God is so good I love you all so much and I'm so
14:44
grateful to God for all of you and I think of you always every day and I I
14:50
pray for you every day and I bless you every day and I thank God for you every
14:55
day thank you Jesus for this precious Army me that you have raised
15:01
up glory to God yes truly in the spiritual realm even today there has
15:07
been a serious shift in the spiritual realm today in this revival pertaining
15:14
to what I just shared there has been a big shift in the
15:21
spiritual realm meaning
15:26
like as I shared this is this revival this end time Revival it is not for one
15:33
denomination it is not for one Ministry it is not like for whoever wants to be a
15:39
part like this is what God is commanding like like like the the Deliverance of the
15:49
Israelites out of Egypt was not like optional like that was what God was
15:57
doing the ra the the passing of the
16:03
Baton Torch from Saul to David was not
16:09
optional it was not if Saul wanted to maybe it was not
16:15
optional um this this move that God is doing is not optional and
16:24
um there's this shift where God is giving um God is giving people has been
16:30
giving people time time to accept him uh time
16:38
to repent you know um those who have
16:43
ignored you know those who've been just like stuck on their own
16:48
selfish um lives or Ministries you know
16:54
but there has been a shift um in the spiritual realm where
16:59
where like time is running short you know um time is running short like God is
17:08
is God is making moves in the spiritual realm to make his move be known and
17:18
accepted and I'm so excited I'm so excited and I'm so
17:26
grateful for God's sovereignty you know um that it's not up
17:33
to man it's not up to people God has the final say and um God's hand will prevail
17:40
and his will will prevail his promises are yes and amen this is the year the
17:46
promise will be fulfilled 2023 and it shall be
17:54
fulfilled it's like in the spiritual realm there is a a glass ceiling like a
18:00
ceiling that man that that that people try to put um on God's on God's
18:08
move and in the spiritual realm God is
18:13
breaking that ceiling now and he what he wants is for his people to be the ones
18:21
to move out like move out of the way in terms of trying to stop it or trying to
18:26
stifle it um so whether they will Mo move out of the way of their stifling
18:32
and you know ignoring or suppressing or he will bust up bust open the ceiling
18:40
[Laughter] himself and also I just want to share
18:45
now is the time to to to be so loud and proud for what God
18:51
is doing it's time God is using his army right now to to speak out to to shout to
19:00
let the world know God is using the weak and foolish things right now to let
19:06
um let the world out you know there was even um you know uh I I saw Chella I don't
19:15
know if she's here right now but she'll probably watch this later who who who translates so many videos in into the
19:20
French language but she tagged some Christian leaders and um you know
19:28
there's there's several uh like mainstream Christian leaders that
19:34
um that you know maybe they're not um you know speaking about uh uh like God's
19:44
power it's a new thing that God's doing right it's a new thing so so God is raising up new people to bring a new
19:50
thing um but even if you're not um used to speaking about it or seen it it's no
20:01
excuse uh to not receive a new thing that God is doing amen and so God is is
20:08
really speaking this to to leaders now come and receive what God is doing come
20:13
and accept me in my new move and so
20:18
um Chella uh uh tagged some some of
20:23
these leaders and one leader who was in um just like
20:30
mainstream Christianity leader uh she ended up writing on the post thank you Jesus and it really touched my heart
20:38
because it was the first like uh like like mainstream Christian leader that I
20:44
think I've seen um you know acknowledge acknowledge uh the beautiful deliverance
20:51
and Revival movement that God is doing and um I was just thinking wow God is
20:57
using the weak and foolish things you know God is using this woman in in in
21:03
France to uh be like a Samaritan woman at the well and say Hey you look and see
21:10
what God is doing come be a part of this and she she heard she heard and she
21:20
acknowledged it and praised god with us
21:25
so keep going this is more of what um God is asking of his army right now to
21:32
be the Samaritan woman at the well to speak come this is God come and join us
21:40
come receive the same God Jesus that we praise and worship this is him here come
21:46
and praise God With Us and be a part of this
21:52
amen that's what God is asking right now because this is the good news this is
21:57
the good news we need to tell the world what God is doing this is good news and
22:03
so back in the times of the spiritan woman of the well she ran and knocked on doors and you know yelled to everyone on
22:09
the streets she didn't have social media but if she had social media she would be tagging people like crazy look what God
22:16
is doing you can't miss out on this the world needs to see what God is doing I
22:22
want you to receive this Jesus look and see look and see uh this and here and
22:29
here and here you see this you see this testimony here you see this testimony here do you need more proof here I'll
22:36
tag you here and here and here this is good news we have to share
22:41
the good news we have to be unashamed and proud of our Jesus and have a heart for others to receive him
22:51
amen amen yet through it all the good news of Heaven's Kingdom will be
22:56
proclaimed all over the the world providing Every Nation with a demonstration of the reality of God
23:02
powerful Matthew 24:14 amen yes yes nothing can stop God's
23:11
Revival and it from it growing and reaching the whole world and it being accepted how to know what key is keeping
23:18
me from receiving healing so I have laid out the main keys to receive freedom and
23:25
healing in my message how to receive complete Deliverance that's on my YouTube uh there's a playlist called how
23:32
to receive and maintain Deliverance it's the first message so watch that video um
23:42
and if you've applied all of those keys if you've applied all of those keys then
23:50
there are a couple more things that might that that that's the case Okay so
23:56
one of them could be that God is asking you to come to the Apostle Peter shadow of today in person to come
24:04
in person to make a sacrifice and come in person uh and receive that anointing
24:12
it's like uh there's so many miracles that happen huge Miracles that happen
24:17
just through the screen with people not coming in person um but it doesn't negate the fact that there is something
24:23
even more extra powerful of coming in person and sometimes I've seen sometimes
24:29
many people they've watching online and they're receiving deliverance from all these things but then they come in person and
24:34
then the thing that that they've been still stuck with is broken off so that's just sometimes God wants you to make the
24:42
sacrifice to come in person um and receive more that that's
24:48
some it's not always it's not for everybody I mean some people they are just healed delivered of everything just
24:53
watching online although I will say God definitely at some point will want you to come in person at least once from
25:00
where you're receiving from where you're planted uh to release more to you as part of the sacrifice there's many
25:06
things of sacri sacrifice that releases more that God wants to give us so
25:11
there's a lot of things that come without any kind of sacrifice but there're definitely are things and these are Miracles these are Financial
25:17
breakthroughs Financial blessings that impartation that God withholds until we
25:23
sacrifice and the sacrifice looks like financially sewing that's why so many times uh that's a key to receiving
25:31
Deliverance is is is is is purely the the the principle of sacrifice it has nothing to do with like money but it's a
25:38
principle of sacrifice um that that is what releases
25:45
the the anointing God wants you to Value his anointing and his power and not to take it cheap like oh I'm just going to
25:52
turn on the video and just receive all my Miracles like he wants you to really value it and so one of the ways that he
26:00
tests the value and sees if you value is by asking you to sacrifice and then
26:06
releasing and that's all God that's just him um it's our our job my job as a
26:12
vessel to teach you this principle but it's it's not up to to me you know it's
26:19
not about like paying someone to receive a miracle no if it's not up to me um
26:27
like I can't I can't say oh Lord please for this miracle don't ask
26:34
them to make a sacrifice whether that's sewing a seed or taking a trip in person
26:40
to come I can't do that it's up to God you know what specific things what
26:46
specific Miracles he has is like withholding until a sacrifice is made
26:52
you know that's I just I it's just my job to teach that so that you can follow
26:58
the leading of the Holy Spirit when he asks you to make certain sacrifices when he asks you to sew something when he
27:05
asks you to make a sacrifice and come in person and receive more
27:12
amen um so just back to that question of asking when they were asking what am I
27:18
missing so if you've applied all these keys so it's either two things one thing
27:24
God is asking you to make more of a sacrifice which me many times mean coming in person and to
27:30
where the anointing is and and number two or number two um your healing is taking time because
27:39
many times that's just what God decides he is testing your obedience your faith
27:46
and your humility uh like there are many examples in the
27:52
Bible where the healing wasn't immediate one guy was told by a prophet
27:57
to to um go in dip yourself in the pool
28:02
several times why not one time why not two time why why several times so the
28:07
healing didn't come until he dipped himself in several times um there's many examples of the
28:15
Bible where things took time you know the story of Elijah saying go see if
28:22
there's a cloud and rain coming um that cuz rain I see rain coming so go see if
28:28
there's a cloud he says to his servant and he doesn't see anything and he says he he reports he comes back reports and
28:34
he says go again and he tells him to go again several times uh so that's a
28:41
principle of how God works sometimes of purposefully not bringing the healing
28:48
immediately the complete healing but literally choosing to
28:54
release the healing later after you have have walked in obedience remained
29:01
faithful uh and humble and keep trusting God I believe
29:07
you will heal me Lord in your timing like I I believe
29:13
it's done in the spiritual realm and I believe I will see it manifested any day in your timing I believe it he wants to
29:21
see that he wants to see that humility the faith in him and the
29:26
obedience to keep believing and keep doing the prophetic instructions that have been given by the servant of
29:33
God personally and corporately like um in the message that
29:39
I taught about how to receive complete deliverance and the message I taught how to maintain your deliverance like those
29:47
instructions will you be obedient to follow these instructions to see the
29:52
healing manifest completely we have been going through a lot lately how do I know if we are going
29:58
through refining or if it's the devil
30:04
attacking so when you follow God's principles like be surrendered be
30:12
planted be a true disciple who who always shows up for the word of God for
30:19
church and applies the word and values and and follows the
30:26
instructions um that the Rama word that God is speaking um and and keeping door
30:31
shut to the devil when you do these things simply every door is shut to the
30:37
devil but when doors have been opened it can bring about um unnecessary attacks
30:45
from the enemy but you overcome them you repent you surrender to God you renounce any
30:52
open doors that you've made and God will make the devil to flee as you do
31:00
this um so there there is such thing as as attacks coming from the devil that
31:06
didn't need to come um but they came because of open doors and it's important to renounce
31:14
it's important to to to sew and say Lord I'm sorry I'm sacrificing right now I've
31:21
um haven't valued you haven't valued your word I'm I'm you know repenting
31:26
renouncing not just in word but in action by making a sacrifice to you um
31:34
and then so there's that case that God will help you to overcome and you will
31:41
step out of that season of so many attacks that they came because the open
31:46
doors um but but but but then there are if you
31:52
were like keep if you are keeping do shut to the devil and you're following God's principles you're surren surrendered you are truly planted you
31:59
are truly being humble childlike have a pure heart are are really being a true
32:04
disciple um consistently that's how you're living your life and that means you have no
32:10
doors open to the devil and your and in your own life you're not opening up other doors so now there can still be attacks
32:18
that the devil will bring but those are the attacks that God allows and those are attacks are
32:24
exciting whenever God allows attacks it's to push you higher it's to elevate
32:30
you it's to bring refining and make you more like Jesus number one and number
32:35
two is to promote you
32:41
yes when every door is kept shut and you're surrendered and and God allows attacks to come it's exciting it
32:47
literally means you're becoming more like Jesus and it means cuz you're being refined and it means you're going higher
32:54
it means God's lifting you it means reward is coming so
33:01
um you will be able to know based on what I shared if you have been opening
33:07
doors um if you have not been as surrendered if you haven't been valuing
33:13
um Jesus and his anointing and what he's brought you and the blessings he's given you and everything there is open doors
33:20
and so unnecessary attacks are coming that wouldn't have come if you didn't do that but you will overcome this as you
33:27
truly um sincerely repent and renounce and sacrifice to God and V really value
33:35
him again and those attacks will end and you
33:40
will you will now be living a life with all doors shut and now when attacks do
33:45
come they are only for your good to lift you and when attacks do come no weapon
33:52
formed against you will prosper so you'll be able to discern from now with that that so if you know you're keeping
33:59
do shut and you seen attack come you can instantly be excited woo I'm going higher it's refining time it's promotion
34:06
time hallelujah it's test time the tests are given at the end of the year the tests
34:12
are given at the end of the school year at the end of the training the test is the final thing before the
34:20
promotion final step before the promotion how do we differentiate
34:25
between seeing a red flag and being skeptical of a person so by
34:33
daily humbling yourself and Renewing Your Mind to be
34:38
childlike when you're childlike and humble and you make that your priority every day every day like that should be
34:46
like the most important thing is that you are humble and childlike cuz that's the pure heart I
34:52
mean our our biggest desire should be to please God and we can only please God by
34:58
having Clean Hands and a pure heart so every day that should be our biggest prayer Lord Lord give me clean hands and
35:05
a pure heart I want nothing but a pure heart I want nothing but to please you
35:12
and so when you do that every day God answers that prayer and if you need
35:17
humbling God will humble you and um if you need confounding God
35:22
will confound you and God will shape this humble heart in you where you truly do have a humble heart and so when you
35:29
do have a humble heart skepticism won't be in you like like bad skepticism like judgmental
35:37
skepticism won't be in you um and so you will be able to
35:42
literally discern and see you'll be able to see oh this isn't pure what I'm seeing oh this isn't humble what I'm
35:49
seeing um Red Flags uh so
35:57
it comes down to being real with yourself if you know you are um you have
36:04
pride in you still you're not completely humble then you know that
36:10
you can't really trust your judgment of other
36:16
people and we're not called to judge anyone one but we are called to um judge
36:22
the fruits like discern the fruits but if you don't have a humble
36:28
Pure Heart yourself you you're not going to be able to accurately discern fruits so what needs to be priority is to
36:35
humble yourself and allow God to mold your heart so you can accurately
36:42
see how do you know if you're actually being
36:48
humble um by how you think of yourself by how you think of
36:55
yourself um um like by not being know at
37:01
all I mean there's I mean you can be confident in spiritual knowledge that
37:07
you have like for me I'm confident in the spiritual knowledge that I have been
37:13
given but so much of it has been given through my spiritual
37:18
father um and that has humbled me so
37:23
much where I continually don't see myself as this like really important
37:31
person really um you know spiritually amazing
37:37
knowledgeable person I don't see myself as that I see that I have been given
37:42
that by God's grace for his purposes but it's not like I'm so great
37:52
and amazing and smart and like I don't see myself as that I see I'm just
37:59
humbled like it has been given you know um but a
38:06
lot of people it hasn't been given to them and they they because because so
38:14
much of the spiritual knowledge for example spiritual truths God's way is by
38:19
passing it down is through the equipping of the fivefold ministry as it talks about in Ephesians 4 that when the
38:26
fivefold min is there then the the fal Ministry is there for to equip the Saints to bring the equipping not for
38:33
the Saints to equip themselves not for the Saints to become spiritually wise and smart and knowledgeable on their own
38:40
you know um but they will become equipped through the fful ministry and that it goes on to say in Ephesians 4
38:47
that then they will no longer be immature but they will then be mature so
38:53
they will then be mature because of equipping that has come through the five-fold
38:58
ministry so most people that are prideful honestly that I see especially in the in the body of Christ the the
39:05
most people are prideful they they they are like
39:10
spiritual know it alls not from even wrong teaching so much from other people
39:16
sometimes it's that but so much of it's like stuff that God's taught them on their
39:22
own God taught them on their own and they are spiritually so smart they see
39:29
themselves no one else that's why God's system is so
39:35
beautiful because like for me I see that I've received so much because of my spiritual father's obedience and it's be
39:42
it's come through the the prophetic word the I mean the instructions the instructions like making videos and I
39:49
put them out and that happened not just because I heard God on my own to tell me
39:55
to make put videos out and they would reach people and it would go viral and
40:01
that's what would make Revival to spread no it came because of my spiritual father's obedience to become a prophet
40:07
true prophet of God who has the anointing and could to speak that prophetic word
40:13
so when the video goes viral and everything I'm not like oh good thing
40:20
that I heard from God and you know it's like it's like the focus is not on me
40:27
the focus is on Jesus and honoring his and The Obedience of his servant so like
40:34
my spiritual father Prophet Dr J he prophesied that and I I got to hear that
40:39
word that he prophesied the word from God and so then I obeyed you know and so you know so I'm
40:48
not seeing it as like oh it's me that's done this it's me and God that's done
40:53
this you know it it it's like and that that's how it applies to
40:59
everything you know through from the spiritual knowledge that I've received from anointing impartation of anointing I've received um I I I just don't see
41:08
myself as like I just see myself as this weak and foolish uh vessel who still has much to
41:16
learn and grow in um you know so that's
41:22
just kind of an example that I'm giving you to like how to know if you're humble that like that you are really
41:28
seeing how what you have received has come because of other people's obedience
41:35
like other Servants of God obedience um and that you are not being
41:41
to know at all because of the things that God has taught you like on your own um and that you really realize that
41:50
there's so much you still have to learn and that you could be wrong about things
41:57
you could be wrong about things just like having that knowledge like I could be wrong about things I'm not an I don't know
42:04
everything I'm not God I'm not perfect like that that's what you carry in your heart so when you're carrying that in
42:10
your heart you will be humble you'll you'll know you're humble but if you're not carrying these things
42:16
in your heart and you're find you feel like you're this like you know know it all you know and especially based on
42:22
things that you that you think just God taught you you got to check yourself
42:27
because God's big main way of of releasing when it comes to like spiritual principles and knowledge and
42:32
and things is coming usually through other vessels if you are quoting a scripture
42:39
to encourage a friend is that being religious absolutely not that's what you should do that's good the word of God is
42:46
our instruction if you feel God has given you things to share do you keep it to
42:51
yourself or or or to share it how do you do it without being a no all know your
42:57
place know your Dominion as a parent you have you have
43:06
dominion to speak the word of God to your children you also have the responsibility to make sure you're being
43:14
equipped you know to make sure the anointing is flowing through you or else you could be teaching your
43:21
children wrong you could be teaching your children religiously but when you are planted and you are being equipped
43:27
you're being equipped to be a voice of God for others to equip others to to um
43:34
cast out demons of others in your Dominion so if you're a parent um your
43:41
children that's that's your Dominion so you can speak the word of
43:47
God to them when God is Holy Spirit speaking to you something speak the word of God to them
43:54
um but but you you have to make sure you're in your Dominion your Dominion is not just
44:02
anybody um and so don't be going where God hasn't
44:11
called you don't be going and and telling people things that Holy Spirit T spoke to you
44:18
[Music] um when you're not their spiritual father or mother or Mentor for
44:25
example now we're called to encourage we're called to speak prophetically and encourage so encourage everybody
44:31
encourage everybody God's calling you to everybody God's calling you to encourage but be careful about being a teacher
44:39
when you're not called to be a teacher you can share the word that your
44:46
your teacher has released to people who are open don't just shove it in people's throats you can share it on your social
44:51
media you can share it to those who are open and relay the message be like Timothy Paul says Timothy will
44:59
remind you of the words that I have spoken but he didn't say Timothy go speak new
45:06
words at that time it wasn't time I mean there as time progressed and like like
45:12
Elijah and Elisha there was a time when The Mantel went from Elijah to Elisha and now
45:18
Elisha was like the head the head of his ministry now but but before it wasn't
45:24
time yet so Paul and Timothy uh if it when it was then time for Timothy to be
45:30
a head of a Ministry for example if when when when Paul was passing the Baton um
45:36
then it's time for Timothy to be the head and to be the one teaching others
45:42
but before then when he was the spiritual son of Paul it literally says in the Bible Paul said I'm sending
45:49
Timothy to you to remind you to speak the words that I have spoken so Timothy
45:55
was taking Paul's words and giving them to others so it is your calling to relay
46:03
this teaching to others through like your social media sharing it like when you share preaching videos when you
46:09
share quotes that's what you're doing and to share others in your personal life who are open you know not just
46:17
everybody let me give you a teaching you know but to those who are open that becomes uh your Dominion to share but
46:25
not to come be a a teacher speaking new different things being hungry for God all the time
46:32
is good or bad or sometimes you have to feel full um
46:39
so so the thing with with God is it's in terms of this principle is God wants you
46:46
to have this both this balance of being content but
46:53
Hungry Like The like having our our um
46:59
our oil our lamps burning and continual oil um and so we're we're hungry we're
47:06
looking for the door for the bridegroom to come we're hungry we're expectant but at the same time we aren't bitter that
47:14
he's not here yet we are not bitter that the promises haven't come to pass yet we
47:20
are content at the same time we are content because God gives us so much all
47:26
we need every day but there's still more and he wants us to be hungry for more he wants us to be Desiring for more so it's
47:32
both it is both it's like God wants us to keep both to stay in this position of
47:38
gratitude which brings contentment every day but always acknowledging God wants
47:45
to do more God is taken us glory to glory God has promises and you know so
47:50
you're you're keeping the promises alive you're not forgetting about the promises and being like oh this has been a a long time waiting for the promises I think
47:57
I'll just you know kind of forget about them and just like you know just enjoy what I have
48:05
here and just be be get used to this so I so I stop having this uncomfortable feeling he wants us to have that
48:11
discomfort discomfort of hunger and the comfort of contentment at the same
48:17
time it's both it's both I know it sounds contradictory but he wants us to
48:24
have both all the time I mean but there'll be days where
48:31
it's more of the um just basking in like feeling full and just more focused on
48:38
just so grateful and content that we are full but then there will be times where
48:44
you feel really hungry and then you have to make more of an intention to be
48:49
Greatful and content but God does want you to feel even more hungry there will
48:54
be shift there'll be different seasons there will be different seasons and that so there'll be different seasons where
48:59
God wants you to feel more hungry and other Seasons where God wants you to bask in his like promises fulfilled and
49:08
the reward and the goodness of that you know and rejoice like there's times of rejoicing and there's times of being
49:15
hungry and in the wilderness still content you know there's different seasons in life so um just recognize
49:23
like when I'm noticing that like when God freshly brings a promise being fulfilled it is a time of rejoicing it
49:30
is a time of like just focusing on God has done this um just kind of having
49:36
more your focus on just rejoicing and celebrating and um praising God for what he's done you
49:44
know but then there will be Seasons like where that's not as fresh and and and
49:50
and and and and and it's like a long time has passed before the next like promise is fulfilled
49:56
the next level comes and so you'll feel this period of like hunger and it's
50:01
because God wants that hunger he wants you to remember remember there's there's more I I want you to be ready for the
50:07
more I I don't want you to be content here like completely like I don't want you to be um too comfortable here I mean
50:14
I want you to know you're you're going to a higher place you you you need to be
50:19
transformed to to to see yourself at this higher place here so I want you to
50:25
remember remember that this is coming get hungry don't be complacent get hungry
50:32
amen so it's okay to feel these different things it's you will feel these different things it's just
50:37
important to always know be grateful and still be
50:43
hungry just keep that in your heart be grateful but still be hungry if we have people in our home
50:50
that need Deliverance but don't want it yet is there a certain prayer we should pray or declare or just rest under the
50:56
covering um make sacrifice to God SE seeds for
51:02
the specific issue and declare aloud I call them into the kingdom of God I call
51:07
them out of the kingdom of darkness it's like doing the opposite of renouncing and there's so much power in that I call
51:13
them I'm connected to them in the spiritual realm they are my family so I call them and there's power in that
51:20
because you're connected you are family you are connected in the spiritual realm so your words have power so call them in
51:28
call them in and trust that God will bring them in his perfect timing um God
51:33
doesn't force people to be ripe they have to be ripe in his perfect timing he wants them to surrender at the right
51:39
time he doesn't want them to be forced he doesn't he he wants them to come when they're ready when their eyes have
51:44
really opened and they're wanting this they're wanting surrendered they're wanting Freedom so as you've done your
51:51
part of what I just shared rest and TR trust that God is working rest and trust that the Harvest
51:59
will come it's just not time yet in God's perfect timing they'll be ripe and
52:04
they will come and we are in a time now actually
52:10
going back to what I was saying about you know it's important to stay
52:18
hungry we are in this season right now where God doesn't want us as a as a
52:24
collective in this revival as a as a bride to be complacent because it's so beautiful and amazing what God is doing
52:32
and it's it can be easy to just like I mean you're are you're already
52:37
receiving his Abundant Life his anointing and it can be easy to be complacent and just be like and forget
52:45
that God wants to use you to reach others and God wants this revival to
52:51
reach others way more people and so so this is actually what God is doing now
52:56
is he's putting hunger in his people he's asking you to be hungry have hunger
53:02
to be used more powerfully for God like the Samaritan woman at the well be be
53:08
hungry for more people to be reached for more people to receive this have the
53:14
hunger like you are receiving for yourself so much but have the hunger for others have the hunger for God's power
53:22
his anointing to reach the whole world the survival to spread and reach the entire world have this hunger God is
53:30
actually speaking this right now have this hunger so that he can you can hear
53:36
his voice calling you you know to share more to speak up more to tagged you know
53:42
all these things when you have this hunger you will hear his voice directing
53:47
you speak up share do more have a hunger have a heart for
53:54
these people who haven't haven't received him yet I want to declare over every single one of you right
54:04
now I release a new level fresh
54:09
anointing upon you all that as you step up to do God's work with what he is
54:15
calling you to right now to spread the word of what he is
54:20
doing that everything that you do would carry God's power that God would use you
54:26
as a weak and foolish thing to sound the alarm to
54:32
break glass religious ceilings to break ceilings that the devil has brought
54:38
through religion that God would use you to break these
54:44
ceilings that keep his Revival at a certain level may God use you now may God use
54:52
you as you speak may God use you you as you share as you
54:57
testify in your social media may this anointing be upon you upon your social
55:06
media May the power of God do Miracles through you that just as the Samaritan
55:12
woman at the well was just such an ordinary unknown
55:19
person just as as she was just as she had a bad
55:25
past but she was used so powerfully to
55:30
make the Harvest come so powerfully and and and she
55:38
became this known and example for us today may God use you like this may God
55:46
use you to make this revival spread so far in jesus' name may your voice for
55:56
Jesus be Amplified now may it reach all over the
56:03
world get into ears that have not heard get into ears
56:09
that have heard but have not repented may your voice get into those
56:15
ears as you declare what Jesus is
56:20

56:53
God May May the fear of God come upon you
56:59
now of the big thing God has called you to how important you are in the kingdom
57:07
of God how much will happen for God's Kingdom on
57:14
the other side of your obedience may your eyes open up now to
57:20
that reality to that truth and made boldness arise in you may this fire
57:29
increase mightily in jesus' name the fire for
57:34
Jesus his kingdom his Revival the fire for those who are lost to be found for
57:41

57:50
something that I I I I want God wants
57:55
all of you I want all of you to to really
58:00
see when people reject the the move of God they are
58:06
rejecting God when people reject a move of God do not accept the move of God
58:12
because of Pride because of jealousy because of selfish
58:20
reasons think about how much this Grieves God think about
58:25
how rude this is to God think about how heavy this is okay
58:32
um look at God like look at you know how God how we see these people mistreat God
58:38
in the Bible we see these people worshiping false gods these we see God
58:44
grieved over the people he created we see God we see him grieved in the Bible
58:49
we see Saul trying to kill um God's anointed
58:56
one this happens today this happens today and so as you read the Bible you feel in your heart
59:03
like grieved that that people are rejecting God and are disobeying God and
59:09
people in power are rejecting God and disobeying God you feel grieved right
59:15
may your eyes open up to see that this happens today that this is happening today um and and may it light a fire in
59:23
you to stick up more for God to stand on God's side to um you know like for all
59:31
rejecting of God that's happening may we arise more of accepting him and obeying
59:38
him and um being being proud of what he's doing may a as so many are ashamed
59:47
of the Holy Spirit or just you know or rejecting the Holy Spirit may we be the opposite May
59:54
that may your eyes open up in the spiritual realm to this truth that I share to the gravity the weight the
1:00:02
seriousness of it so may this all stem from our love
1:00:09
from for God you know may all that God is calling you to do now to to to to to
1:00:15
to be fire starters spreading this good news like
1:00:20
the spiritan woman at the well may that be stemmed May that you know come from
