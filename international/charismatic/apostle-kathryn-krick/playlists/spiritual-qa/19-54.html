as flourish a one time to attend or as much as possible as much as possible
0:06
um you know even if there's a similar message of what God is doing of what God
0:11
is speaking like okay for example any time
0:16
you hear a message I'm preaching a message you should not listen just one time even the more you listen the more
0:23
Revelation you will receive the more God will speak the more the more God will
0:29
open up your eyes so even if a message is similar even if
0:34
a message that is being preached is similar because the whole world needs to hear this message the more you receive
0:42
it the more you hear it the more God is doing the more God is opening up your
0:47
eyes and then number two anytime you come where God's power is he's doing a
0:53
new thing and he's pouring more of his anointing to you so whether it's Revival events flourish
1:00
conferences Sunday Services you should come as much as
1:05
possible every time you come you will receive more there's no way you cannot
1:12
receive more if you come hungry for God and Desiring him to touch you and do a
1:19
new thing and move in your life you will receive more from God 100%
1:27
absolutely how do I have a conversation with people in the world when they want to talk about zodiac signs and new age I
1:33
find myself not knowing how to handle the conversation in a way that pleases god um
1:40
so you don't have to engage you know
1:46
um those in those people in the world who want to talk about things like that
1:53
they have free will so it's important that we are not dictating people we're not controlling
1:59
people were not for being forceful with people in terms of um correcting them
2:05
and speaking truth if they're not open to it so if you're like in a group of
2:10
people and they're talking about these things
2:15
um it it's usually most of the time it's not the place to say wait a second
2:22
that's demonic you're opening up doors and and all of that um unless they ask
2:30
you if if if you're sitting there and they ask you um you
2:37
know you go to church you know what do you what what do you think about zodiac
2:43
signs and new age because these are considered like spiritual things so what do you think about it because you go to
2:50
church and um you know especially if they're in an open open like really
2:56
wanting to know wanting to learn because they see the light in you so in that
3:02
case you you can share with them gently what you have learned if they're if you
3:08
can sense by the holy spirit that they're really open um but in most cases if they're
3:15
just talking in a group maybe it's like you're in a workplace and it's I don't
3:20
know it's just a time where you can people can talk in the workplace so you're just there and people are having
3:27
these worldly conversations and the most times it's it's wise to just stay quiet
3:32
you don't have to engage you don't have to contribute to the conversation um you just let them in
3:38
their own free will speak what they want to speak without
3:44
participating and um even that even how you walk in wisdom in a situation like
3:50
that is saying something and is planning seeds you know all these ways that you
3:57
are acting Christlike and not of the world people take note of people notice
4:05
and so those seeds add up so all of these different seeds that you're planting showing the love of God um not
4:12
being forceful and just being kind um being quiet and not engaging in the
4:19
conversation with of things of the world that people are people are taking no seeds are being planted and they're all
4:25
good seeds even if they don't realize it even if they're like oh I wonder why they're not contributing to the
4:31
conversation as we're talking about zodiac and new age you know even though it feels like maybe it's not doing much
4:38
it's adding up it's speaking something anything you're doing Christlike is
4:43
planting good seeds no matter what even if the person doesn't know what it means
4:49
at the time it's doing something hallelujah it's it's sending a message
4:56
to them well this person's Christlike maybe they're not sure about God yet but
5:02
this person's Christlike and this is how they behave and this is what they don't engage in so and then it's time goes on
5:08
and they start their eyes start to open up Jesus is the way they remember you they remember you in the workplace years
5:14
ago or something oh yeah I remember that person it was kind of strange they would never talk about New Age um Halloween um
5:23
uh zodiac oh maybe that all that stuff is wrong is not a of
5:31
God how should we view social media accounts that post prophetic prophetic
5:36
words would those be mostly angel of Light well I would just start off with
5:42
this know your shepherd's voice that's where you're supposed to be receiving
5:48
prophetic words uh so your Shepherd is your leader your spiritual mother or your spiritual
5:54
father and so that is a prophetic words you're supposed to be receiving your
5:59
Shepherd um so that's just number one that's the simple way I could just end there even
6:05
to answer that question um but I just will add on and share that there are a
6:13
lot of people who are trying to be prophets who are
6:19
not prophets um sometimes it can be out of selfish ambition sometimes it can be to
6:24
get likes in things um there are many people that are wanting to prophesy for
6:30
culture uh for [Music] um uh what's the word cult uh I'm
6:38
forgetting the word um like present time events current events there we go current
6:44
events current events um and it's like God is speaking so much
6:52
about his move and his Revival and then like it can be actually a distraction to
6:59
be focused seen so much on um entertainment politics just like all these things
7:06
happening in the world there can be so much of a desire sometimes to for people to
7:13
prophesy into these things sometimes it can be with a a a selfish ambition motive to
7:21
get likes and everything because everyone's wanting to know what's going to happen in politics everyone's wants
7:26
to know what's going to happen in current events so much so it's very clickbaity it's very like oh oh oh
7:33
someone prophesied this yes oh I like this prophesy yeah yeah yeah I want this to happen oh yeah I like this you know
7:39
like people know what people want to hear um so that kind of thing is
7:44
definitely definitely goes on in the body of Christ totally so um you and and
7:50
also like many prophetic words are not going to be applying for every single
7:56
person like like some sort of like prophecy that
8:01
says this year you will become a millionaire or this year you will get
8:07
married type amen and you will receive that it's not that's kind of silly if you think
8:15
about it it's like this is the year that every single person in the body of Christ gets married you know or this is
8:21
the year every single person in the body of Christ gets a million dollars you know but people tend to not think of
8:28
think wisely when they see those things they're just like yes that's what I want oh yeah yes that's a sign this it's
8:35
itching ears it's what you want so bad clouds your vision you just wisdom is
8:40
out the window when you hear somebody speak something that you want for your life God led me to take in my brother
8:47
after being released from the mental hospital he was diagnosed with schizophrenia what can I do when he
8:52
decides to keep doors open to the enemy um well if you taking him in um
9:00
it like he's living with you soak the soak the place you're living with the
9:06
anointing play videos such as fivefold Church videos such as my videos play
9:12
them so the anointing is flowing and moving in that house it's having an
9:17
effect on him it's touching him and just depending on how much he's
9:23
open with the leading of the Holy Spirit depending on how much he is open to learning more re receiving more you can
9:30
gently share things with him that you've learned share about open doors share
9:37
about how you've learned how Freedom comes and how you maintain your freedom
9:45
you can share these things with him if he's open and and God is going to be
9:51
moving and protecting should we only pray in tongues when we feel the unction of the Holy Spirit or can we begin to pray
9:57
without it so any type of prayer needs to be done with
10:03
intention um with in discipline and practice
10:09
so you know you know how it says in the Bible pray continually
10:14
so when it comes to praying in tongues as you ask should it be the unction of the Holy Spirit Well the holy spirit's
10:20
already saying praying pray continually so that's going to be in word in
10:27
tongues um so there so there will be times when you know maybe you realize I
10:32
haven't prayed in the spirit in a while I need to do this I need to do this right now I need to Value this gift from
10:40
the Holy Spirit and this way of communicating to God and this tool to uh
10:46
fan into flame my spirit and also if you're ever
10:52
feeling um like not like like you need to F in your F to Flame your spirit and
10:59
you're you're feeling Less on fire that's that's a time also to pray in the
11:04
spirit is persecution seasonal so it's persecution seasonal uh
11:11
so this is how it works what Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit to be to be
11:18
tested he was tempted he was well he was tested by the
11:23
devil the devil tried to tempt him um and this was a time where he was was
11:29
being attacked by the devil and going through this testing in the
11:36
wilderness and after that was completed the Bible says that the devil left him
11:41
for a time for a time so when it comes to
11:48
persecution when it comes to attacks from the devil that God turns for good
11:54
turns into testing it's it is seasonal on way it it's it's new levels new Devils so there
12:03
will be testing in one level persecution in one level and then you pass that and
12:09
you you you you don't return to that again you go higher and then there's a
12:15
new level and a new testing um and and different kind of
12:20
persecution different kind of attack then you you win and you overcome that and you keep going higher and higher and
12:27
higher do we have to worship every day so worship means to give praise to God
12:37
means to glorify God means to put your attention on God and give him
12:44
glory and lift up his name and you can worship him with song singing but that's
12:52
not the only way that you can worship Him and first of all if you worship him with song it doesn't have to mean only
13:00
just this dedicated time where you're in the in a room and your hands are lifted
13:06
in your singing worship it could also mean in the car in the shower you know
13:12
if genuinely from your heart you're worshiping Jesus um worship doesn't have to only be
13:20
uh through song worship worship you can worship God through your
13:26
obedience you can worship God through how you you you you you serve him that's
13:32
worship let everything you do be done unto the Lord so when your intention
13:38
when your heart your motivation behind what you're doing is to give glory to
13:43
God is to praise him you're worshiping him so do we have to worship God every
13:49
day we get to worship God every day in obedience and also it's an honor and
13:54
privilege and so we should worship God every day and it will look different
14:00
every day it it shouldn't be a ritual type thing but it should be your life
14:05
should be worship if someone can't really speak in tongues much like if they only speak a few sentences in tongues does that mean there's a
14:11
spiritual blockage I've been struggling with this so when many times when you
14:16
first receive the gift of tongues it's kind of like being a baby where there's
14:23
just only a few words and there's nothing wrong with that and as you continue surrendering to God and
14:28
continuing to pray in the spirit more will come just like how baby's uh
14:34
vocabulary grows with time so it's not something to worry about not something to be distracted by and you know have to
14:44
pray against it's it's just a matter of continuing to surrender and keep on pressing into Jesus and keep on using
14:52
that gift and more will come this might seem like a silly question but if we are easily startled by insects and certain
14:58
animals does that mean anything spiritually well God wants you to If by startled if you mean
15:05
fear um God doesn't want you to have any fear and
15:10
um to have even a a fear of just like one little thing like insect or
15:15
something it can have an effect on you you know it can if you're feeling those feelings of
15:21
fear if you're feeling anxiousness um that's that's having an effect that God doesn't want you to have
15:28
he wants you to to be in perfect peace always and um it's important that we be
15:35
free of all fear and we be strong and confident people of God in every area
15:43
because the more we're living that way the more we are truly living free of
15:48
fear full of confidence and courage uh and seeing ourselves
15:54
accurately as powerful Servants of God With God inside of us people of God the
16:00
more Victorious we will be over the devil you know so it it can translate
16:06
like if you have um a a certain thing that you're afraid
16:12
of then that's going to have an effect on you in terms of it how you see the
16:19
devil you know because the truth is is that like a bug for example is has a lot
16:26
less power than the devil the devil has way more power has Supernatural Powers
16:32
nothing compared to God's power that's in you but you see what I'm saying like we really need to see who we are in
16:38
Christ and see God's protection over us and really live in that Revelation that there is nothing to fear and when and
16:49
not let things anything get to us not let anything bother us not like any not let anything Shake us the more we are
16:55
that way in every area of life that's how it will translate in the spiritual real that's how it will translate it we
17:01
will we will translate that courage and faith and um strength when the enemy
17:10
comes up against us in life in the future we will not be
17:15
shaken so if you're finding a certain irrational fear a certain fear of something anything it's very important
17:21
to really not ignore that but reject that renounce it so God can take that
17:27
completely out of your life take that fear take that irrational fear out of your life
17:33
completely can a family member be healed based off your faith and standing in the gap for them yes absolutely there's many
17:39
examples of this in the Bible there's many examples where um a parent their
17:44
child was dead in one case another parent another CH another parent had a child who was demonically oppressed and
17:52
Jesus said believe and your child will your child will be healed so
17:59
uh that's how Jesus moves today that's how Jesus moves today that's a
18:05
principle but in the same time it's not like always always always always like if
18:11
you have faith automatically the family member will be healed because there are
18:17
complexities in the spiritual realm sometimes the key that unlocks a person's Miracle is for that person to
18:24
have faith themselves for that person in their own free will to desire God to
18:32
touch them so it it it just depends on the situation spiritually um you know like
18:40
if a person really does not want Jesus really is stubborn in their heart
18:46
usually that will be a time when it's really needed for that person
18:51
to believe but then if another person isn't so like stubborn
18:57
hearted um resistant to God's power but
19:02
maybe they just they just don't know enough yet
19:07
they just haven't encountered um the power of God to be so open and calming
19:14
to Jesus and his power like you are for example that Grace can extend to
19:21
them so it depends on the situation but it's just very important for you to believe and
19:27
declare healing and freedom for your family members I just want to say something for
19:34
some questions that you may have sometimes the answer is already
19:41
there by looking at the example of your Shepherd do they have this do they do
19:48
these things yes no the answer is there already
19:55
yeah the answer is there how to know if you are in God's will in
20:00
every aspect of your life so the most important part is to surrender
20:06
everything to surrender every part of your life and really mean it from your heart and live in that every day live in
20:14
that surrender and tell Jesus I want to be in your will completely and then when
20:20
you have certain um Ambitions certain Ambitions that creep
20:27
up in your heart make sure you are real with yourself you know like make sure
20:33
when you sense yourself really wanting something you got to remember first of
20:40
all this might not be God's will for my life or if it is God's will for my life
20:45
it may not be his timing yet so like if ever I find myself like really wanting a
20:54
promise to come to pass that I know is from God that I know has been prophesied when I find when I find myself really
21:00
wanting it really thinking about it a lot and really like hungering and longing for it I will stop myself I will
21:08
I will you know remind myself you know remember not
21:16
to be obsessed with the promise and get distracted you know with the fact that
21:22
it's not here yet that you're not fully present and grateful for everything that God's giv you and this moment and also
21:30
that you're not fully present to do the best of your ability what God is calling you do to do today you know and that can
21:37
even include like if if if I were to let my mind you know dwell on the promises that are not here yet and be when if you
21:44
start doing that like oh I want them to come so badly um why aren't they here
21:49
yet and I just wish they were here if you really dwell in that place even not
21:56
speaking anything aloud but just in your mind you're there a lot you're definitely going to go to this place of
22:02
not as joyful if that's what you continue to think about it's going to start going
22:08
there it's going to start you're just going to start feeling not as happy not as excited about life
22:15
presently you know and so for me I know I have this responsibility to be the
22:21
brightest light possible and like for example when I minister to be full full
22:26
of joy so I could because whatever is in me is going to come out you know so I
22:32
want to make sure I'm full of Life full of joy full of Faith full of the revelation of God's goodness and his
22:39
faithfulness so that everything that I do that's it's coming out it's coming out in my words it's coming out with my
22:46
actions um it's coming out with energy and joy and strength you know you know
22:52
instead of saying God is good God is good like mean it from my heart and feel
23:00
it CU it's really in me so um I'm just giving you like a
23:06
little little example as a holy spirit's leading of just how to be in God's will every every aspect so you know that
23:14
could be a moment where you're going out of God's will just in your mind and you you know you might not realize it
23:19
because you know you're thinking about the promises and stuff but when you can catch if you catch yourself crossing
23:24
over that line starting to go into like long in too much and
23:31
um being annoyed that it's not here yet and everything um that's like a wakeup
23:38
call like whoop whoop don't go out of God's will don't go out of God's will with your mind um because it'll have a domino
23:46
effect in other areas too and you know that's what this is what I mean like be sensitive be very sensitive
23:54
to your your thoughts because everything starts with the thoughts your words come from your
24:01
thoughts your actions come from your thoughts so that's a big way to make sure you're being in God's will is being
24:08
aware and attentive to your thoughts to make sure that your thoughts are pleasing to God the word says let the
24:14
words of my mouth and meditation the meditation of my heart be pleasing to
24:20
you Lord so that's really a prayer of let everything that I do everything that
24:26
I think everything that I speak be in alignment with your will be pleasing to you Lord so if that is your prayer and
24:34
inent and intention daily you'll be able to hear the Holy Spirit guiding you o
24:42
you're you're about to step out of my will come on back come on back stay stay in the center you know um that's that's
24:51
how you'll be able to stay there you got to have the fear of God and really want it make the decision to really want it
24:57
make the decision to be authentic real not fake true naked
25:03
before God you have to make that decision to really live in that fear of
25:09
God it's the best place to be it's the best place to be
25:16
Hallelujah and if there's something that you're not sure about you know am I in God's will in this area I genuinely just
25:22
don't know I want to be in his will but I'm just unsure the best thing I I mean the best
25:28
thing you should do first of all know that God directs the steps of the righteous man or woman God wants you to
25:35
be in his will more than you want to be in his will so it should never be something you're
25:40
worried about because God wants this more than you do and it's a promise that if you're righteous your steps will be
25:47
directed by God so what you need to make sure of is that you're being righteous
25:53
like doing what I've just been sharing like really being true not fake not not
26:00
um not uh Allowing God to invade every part of your life invite him in every
26:06
aspect of your life don't hide things from God don't hide thoughts you know
26:11
don't hide actions don't hide don't be lying you know
26:18
um so make that your prayer and then if there's something you're not sure about
26:25
go to God about it talk to him about pray to him about how you don't know his will in this area
26:32
and you want to be in his will and seek Him seek him in his word seek him in the
26:37
Rama present tense word the teachings so be a real disciple uh listen to these
26:43
Q&A because sometimes that question that you have is going to just come up and that's the way that God is answering you
26:52
um sometimes you know okay maybe you're not sure if you're hearing God's voice and something well
26:58
so you should seek that you should go I have a playlist relationship with God playlist and there's a teaching how to
27:05
hear God's voice I have teachings of how to hear God's voice listen to that listen to that um
27:14
and that's going to God's going to be speaking giving you Revelation through that through that you might discover oh
27:20
yes this is God's voice or oh this was the angel of Light this was my old way
27:25
of hearing God's voice that I actually was like wrong you know he'll he'll guide you he'll he'll speak to you um and if you're not
27:33
completely sure of the answer right away just keep seeking him seek and knock and
27:40
the and the door will be answered you will find God you sometimes you have to knock a couple times like it's it's not
27:47
always just this easy easy what's your will God quickly Audible Voice comes you
27:53
have to seek but when you do that you will find
27:59
God's voice always he will lead you perfectly in his will how to have wisdom
28:06
in leaving an old wine Church especially if I have been there for a while well
28:13
first of all there's a scripture I actually shared it yesterday there's a
28:18
scripture that says the things of the spirit are foolish to the carnal
28:24
man so this verse is speaking about people whose eyes haven't been opened up
28:30
to the spirit those in the old wine their eyes haven't been opened up fully um to to
28:39
the new wine and to the the the the the full and true
28:45
Revelation that we are supposed to have as Believers the revelation of God and his
28:51
kingdom and his ways and how we are supposed to minister and what our lives
28:56
are supposed to look like as children of God that these signs should follow us those who believe all so many different
29:03
aspects like how to minister with love and grace rather than forcefulness how to minister led by the
29:10
Holy Spirit rather than rituals so many people in the old wine think that it's
29:15
rituals that saves people rituals such as um a communion a certain time every
29:23
month or something rituals such as repeat after me sinners prayer which
29:29
actually isn't in the Bible that there's a that we're supposed to that the way someone's saved is that there's a repeat
29:36
after me prayer it's not in the the B there's not even a sinner's prayer
29:42
actually in the Bible so so much the time that has become this ritual and it loses it loses power when things are
29:49
based on ritual When Things become more ritual it's not that we do away with every kind of tradition and ritual but
29:56
um of course even Christ is a tradition and ritual so I'm not saying all rituals are bad but when things become more
30:05
ritual then like the ritual becomes the the foundation that's when it loses its
30:13
power that's when it becomes religion and void of God's spirit there's a lot
30:19
of people repeating the the the repeat after me prayer and they're not truly
30:25
saved they're not truly surrendered some may be think oh I do this ritual and then I go to heaven
30:31
cool so um anyways there's just a lot of different examples I can say about old
30:38
wine but and then there's there's there's different kinds of ways that that the things of the spirit are
30:45
foolish to the carnal man so there's some people who just won't understand the new wine they think things are
30:53
perfect as they are in the old wine and they just don't understand it just think
30:58
you're strange they don't get it and then there'll be some people that are
31:04
like Pharisees and um think you're deceived and think that the new wine is
31:12
false and everything so there's different different um variations of the
31:18
meaning the things of the spirit are foolish to the carinal man and so you
31:24
can have good-hearted people who aren't judgmental but because their eyes haven't opened up
31:30
yet maybe they didn't have the opportunities of Grace that you did maybe they hadn't seen a video pop up on
31:37
their uh social media page or something like that like they they are how you
31:43
once were maybe and so what when they hear about things happen in the in the
31:50
new wine and the Revival the power of God to them it's just strange maybe
31:56
maybe they're not judgmental but is just strange and they don't understand so you can have those people then you can have
32:02
people who are against right so I just share that all all that to say is to
32:08
first of all have that just wisdom that awareness that those who are making the choice to stay in the old wine that's
32:15
where they're at um many of you including myself were in the old wine
32:20
were in old wine churches so there's this span of there's
32:26
a span of people some are judgmental and like the Pharisees and some are like the
32:32
people in the synagogues of the Pharisees that are just like how you and I were who just don't know better and
32:39
just are there doing what we think is doing what they think is best right and
32:46
they will come into the Revival they will come into the new wine um but maybe
32:51
it's not time yet maybe this is the importance of the passing of the Baton that God has been calling leaders of the
32:57
the body of Christ to do because you know
33:03
if the Sheep following the principle the good principle of following their Shepherd so if they're following their
33:09
Shepherd but their Shepherd's not acknowledging the Revival that God's
33:14
brought the new Servants of God that he's risen up the Deliverance that's available the
33:21
power of God that's available if they're not sharing anything about it the Sheep don't know any better many times they're
33:27
just doing what they're supposed to be doing and following their Shepherd you know they may even be
33:33
thinking it's disloyal to um turn an ear another way or I mean you know be be
33:42
drawn to the new wine maybe some are thinking that way and that's not really wrong because it's the principle of um
33:49
of being a a good sheep and following the voice of your Shepherd so that's why it's it's God has really been speaking
33:56
the Ping the Baton really needs to happen for leaders in the body older leaders in the body of Christ older
34:02
generation it really needs to happen for the sake of the sheep for the sake of God is making this shift for all all
34:09
believers um all believers he's shifting them from old wine to new wine he's shifting them from dryness to the
34:17
anointing receiving the anointing Deliverance healing Abundant Life God wants that shift to come now for all of
34:24
his children but you have but but how he's making that shift is it's it's like
34:31
there's there was John the Baptist who are really doing the work of God and then there was Jesus who came right and
34:39
John the Baptist prepared the way and passed the Baton to to Jesus so Jesus is
34:44
moving now through Servants of God that God is rising up with the new wine and
34:49
there's supposed to be this like John the Baptist of Jesus this this
34:55
um this bridge this passing the Baton this there's greater coming there's
35:01
there's anointing coming there's power of God coming you've got you guys have been getting great teachings for so long
35:07
you know you've been getting really good teachings but now it's time for even better than just teachings the power of
35:14
God Deliverance healing and the power of God upon teachings open bringing the
35:19
apostolic teachings to you that that feed you deeper things in the spirit that really open up your eyes to the
35:26
complexities of the spirit spiritual realm that equip you to be Victorious
35:32
and M a mature vessel of God that's what's that's what's God's
35:37
trying to do now that's what God is doing now but um yeah so so this is the state of the
35:45
body of Christ you have some sheep who are like being stuck because it it's is it's as if John the
35:52
Baptist you know if their leaders like John the Baptist but John the Baptist didn't say like go receive over here
35:59
with Jesus receive Deliverance healing it's like that so they're just following
36:04
their Shepherd still and and staying not just receiving teaching not receiving
36:10
the power of God yeah so I say all that to say is that we have a lot of people who are
36:16
precious Hearts but um like Precious Hearts but they might
36:23
still be seeing the the new wine is foolish it's so so so what I mean is if
36:29
you are if if God is leading you to to leave an old wine Church to come into the new wine be planted where he's
36:35
calling you to be planted it's best to do it quietly and peacefully and with
36:41
this understanding that a lot of people will understand and that you want to
36:46
keep peace maybe with certain people that you're close to or that are really open they're open and they see change in
36:53
your life or they're really curious why you aren't um coming to that church
37:00
anymore if they're coming with an open heart and not um
37:05
judgmental then you can share with them as Holy Spirit leads you can share with
37:10
them this is what I have received this is where God has calling me to be planted now and this is what I have
37:16
received so far even before I became planted my whole life's changed and I've
37:21
received healing Deliverance I've been I've been brought closer to Jesus my eyes have been opened up to the spirit
37:27
spiritual real and I've had victory over the devil in my life like I never have in my entire life and um this is the
37:34
move of God this is Revival that's happening right now and he wants me to be a part of it and being part of it
37:40
means I got to be equipped I got to be planted where his power is where his
37:46
move is so I can receive his anointing so I can receive all that I need to be
37:51
fully free and equipped to be a powerful vessel of God in this move of God you
37:57
know you can you can share with them simply in not a pressuring way and not like
38:03
a this church is wrong where we have been they don't have the new wine you
38:09
know you don't need to do it in a judgmental way in a speaking bad way you shouldn't be doing it like that but you
38:16
should just be sharing your own personal testimony with this understanding that that the things of the spirit are
38:22
foolish so in some way they probably won't understand anything so don't try to force be gentle and be
38:28
respectful of them their decisions and the church that you both have been a
38:34
part of that you have now left and it's very important that you
38:40
represent Christ well in this way because by you doing this by you walking
38:46
in this wisdom that I just shared you are shining your light and God wants them in the new wine but it won't come
38:53
out of force the kindness of God leads to repentance so they will see your life they will see your kindness and they
38:59
will be like wow I want that too as you share that will be their thoughts rather
39:05
than why are they trying to manipulate me force me pull me from this church that I love and you
39:13
know that's not very Christlike how they're speaking against the church that
39:19
I'm a part of and that they've been a part of and you know what does that look like for a minister to pass the
39:25
Baton really simple really just acknowledging God has brought Revival
39:32
and God is using this servant of God in anointing in power to bring Deliverance
39:39
to bring healing and there have been so many testimonies I've seen I've witnessed of people be delivered of all
39:46
sorts of Oppression and healed from all sorts of sickness and receive impartation to walk in the power of God
39:52
themselves this is really Revival that God has brought this is a move of God
39:57
and we need to be United in the body of Christ and as a general in the faith as
40:03
a leader in the body of Christ I have this responsibility God has spoken to me that I am to not be about my not care
40:12
about power but but but care about the body care about God's will care about
40:21
the sheep and if I don't use my power for good people won't know that there is
40:27
power that God's brought to this earth to the body of Christ to bring them healing and deliverance so God has asked
40:34
me to do this and so I just want to say that this person is a true servant of
40:39
God and glory to God God is using them in the power of
40:46
God to bring deliverance and healing and new wine that we've prayed for a long
40:52
time it's very simple just acknowledging acknowledg ing um the move
40:59
that God has brought the anointing that God has brought the servants that he's risen up that would change a lot of
41:05
people did that so many more people would receive absolutely absolutely amen that's why God is
41:11
calling calling the leaders to do this the older generation
41:17
leaders how do we keep our hearts open to receive those into the new wine who
41:22
have rejected it as of now but when their eyes open up how can
41:27
we make sure our hearts have stayed pure to welcome them in so when people reject
41:34
the new wine when people reject your testimony the best thing to do is
41:40
to not let that offend you and stay pure in heart right from the
41:47
start to bless them to renew your mind with that scripture that I shared that
41:52
the things of the spirit are foolish to the carnal man
41:58
so there are people whose eyes haven't opened up yet and it's just going to be foolishness to them and sometimes that's
42:05
many times that is because they're choosing to have pride but still guess what we are not called to judge people
42:11
that's God's job so we are not called to be like H if you would just humble
42:19
yourself your eyes would see and understand we're not called to be that way but rather we should you know give
42:26
the benefit of the doubt and see people with Grace and look at how Jesus saw
42:31
Saul who became Paul he had he looked at him with so much grace with so much
42:37
grace and then the kindness of God was able to lead to repentance turning him
42:43
to Paul so um we don't know the full story of why
42:49
people are prideful of why they are the way they are that's making them so hard
42:55
to receive hard to be humble and and to receive we don't know the full story you
43:00
know I always share this like my parents are amazing and pure and humble and I
43:06
know that that shaped me and I know that God had to do that because of my calling
43:11
so then there's other people out there that didn't have my calling didn't have my grace they didn't have the parents
43:17
that I did and I know simply that's the reason like simply their parents were super judgmental super critical super
43:23
skeptical super in the old wine um and religious and it shaped them and for
43:32
them it's probably going to take longer than it did for me way longer probably they can get there they will get there
43:39
in Jesus name but it'll probably take longer you know so just just having that that's Grace
43:44
is part of Grace is giving people benefit of the doubt is having this understanding hey I've needed God's
43:51
grace I was not born perfect and I'm not perfect you know um I need God Grace
43:57
still and so this person needs God's grace they need more of God's grace in this area than I needed God's grace but
44:02
I need God's grace in other areas that maybe they didn't need it and you know just H it's that heart of benefit of the
44:10
doubt that heart of seeing the best in people Desiring the best of people being
44:16
intentional to see God's heart for people so having keeping on that heart
44:22
of Grace Renewing Your Mind how God sees people how God sees people you're never
44:28
too far gone no matter what you've done God still wants God doesn't want to send you to Hell God still loves you and
44:35
wants to be in relationship with you and wants to use you powerfully wants you to
44:40
fulfill your purpose just like what he did with Paul Paul killed so many
44:45
Christians so he was doing like the worst thing possible because he wasn't just killing people he's killing
44:50
Christian so he was trying to stop the move of God um and God ended up transforming him
45:00
to be the most the powerful servant of God leader in the body of Christ writing
45:06
most of the New Testament so that's still how God sees people that's still how God sees you like how he saw Paul
45:14
who used to be Saul so Renewing Your Mind with that Renewing Your Mind with that and not
45:20
letting your heart your mind dwell on the bad parts of the person the way
45:28
that person the the hurt it caused you that how they rejected Jesus
45:34
you the move of God the Servants of God how can we fully crucify selfishness
45:42
and being self-absorbed so the biggest thing you can do is do
45:48
the opposite of it is make the action in intention to do the opposite of being
45:53
selfish is is is take the step like it's a choice to do any type of action to do any type of
46:01
action is a choice you can choose to do something you don't want to do so if
46:07
you're full of all sorts of selfishness being self-absorbed thoughts
46:12
guess what you're not going to feel like doing selfless acts but you have the
46:20
power and ability to do those things so that that's a big way of of
46:27
crucifying that flesh is by sacrificing doing something you don't
46:33
want to do picking up your cross and just doing it that's you saying that's
46:41
you denying your flesh that's saying no I will not be this way I am going to be
46:47
a selfless person I'm going to have a servant heart I'm going to put people
46:53
before myself I'm going to put God's work first so so big examples of this
46:58
are in giving to the work of God sewing into the work of God continually
47:05
and and generously another way you can do this is by serving in the work of
47:14
God um if you don't know how to serve a big way you can serve is share what God's
47:20
doing share the videos share like comment make do your part to make the
47:26
video be seen by more people the way we do this is by interacting with the
47:31
videos like comment share do that for every video for every post you doing
47:36
that is it's it's how things work today in today's Times the more people
47:42
interact with like comment share save a
47:47
post literally is how the video gets out to more people into the algorithm space
47:56
so do do that um and then on a day-to-day basis put other people first
48:03
put other people first look for ways to serve people look for ways to serve your family members look for ways to serve your friends be sensitive to their needs
48:10
be sensitive to how you can help them be alert be aware and do it and fast
48:15
whatever the selfish things are if there's certain selfish things in your life that you're able to fast fast them
48:24
if you find you know ifying your flesh of like entertainment
48:29
I don't know being on social media for so long watching TV movies for so long if that's preventing you from being
48:35
selfless in some areas from um it's taking up time that you could be serving
48:41
God um things like this then fast these things that are keeping you from being
48:49
selfless if it's giving to it's if it's being generous fast spending so much
48:55
money on yourself so you're able to be self make the
49:00
selfless act if my cousin who's also planed 5f were to faint next to me how should I pray or not pray for her um
49:08
should my faith remain on our five of spiritual covering um yeah so if there's
49:13
like a certain emergency thing that happens um like like you described you
49:19
can speak life Speak Life you can pray for this person um and pray with wisdom
49:27
pray powerful prayers this anointing where you are planted you are planted I
49:33
am planted this anointing must come and and touch you now and bring healing now
49:40
you are healed by Jesus Stripes you can declare these things so it's in
49:46
alignment with where you are planted it's an alignment with the kingdom of God
49:54
order it's um pray with revelation of the power you have access to that's
50:00
covering you rather than praying in old wine forgetting the anointing that's
50:06
covering you and um trying to do things in your own power trying to find
50:12
anointing somewhere in the air or something like that like oh my gosh I need there's
50:18

50:23
