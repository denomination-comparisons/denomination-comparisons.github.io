0:00
can Christians who have all doors closed and have been delivered still have a demon attack them at night out of
0:08
nowhere so when a Believer is delivered they are planted where the anointing is
0:14
and they're truly delivered from all demonic oppression uh a demon cannot come in as
0:20
long as the doors are remaining shut and you're surrendered a demon cannot enter But there can be attacks there can
0:29
we in a spiritual we're all in a spiritual war and so an attack can come
0:34
outwardly um i' I've really seen this um I've
0:40
really seen how the enemy is so angry when people are set free like I've I've seen it just when a
0:49
person has been in bondage for a long time and then they're free the enemy simply is not happy about that and so
0:57
sometimes he can come back Maybe not immediately but later maybe a month later or several months later um just
1:04
like in a strategic like Ambush attack hoping hoping that you'll open the door
1:12
and allow him to come back in but you have Victory you just have to reject you
1:17
have to resist the devil and he has to flee so this is something to be aware of if you have been in bondage for a while
1:24
especially if you've been in a lot of different kinds of bondage the enem is
1:29
not happy once you are set free and so one of the schemes of his is to appear
1:37
like um like a demon has come back but it hasn't
1:45
it's just an outward attack that the enem is hoping you will open the door
1:51
accept that attack and give access for more demons to come back um so if you
1:58
ever sense this kind of attack a severe type of attack reject the devil renew
2:04
your mind that you are free you are protected when you're planted where anointing is you are protected you do
2:11
not have to fear you do not have to make it bigger than it is like make
2:16
the attack bigger than it is you have Victory the devil's just a liar so even if he's portraying himself to be so
2:23
scary and big he's just a liar what are the signs that you should not keep
2:28
someone close to you for your spiritual health um to summarize it if the
2:36
person's not surrendered to God um so this is one of the ways it
2:42
will manifest when a person is not surrendered to God if they are
2:48
speaking um just words to you that are that are distracting you know that
2:57
are not edifying that are not that that that are
3:05
literally distracting you from your calling distracting you from keeping your focus on God um maybe when they're
3:12
speaking so much of worldly things maybe when they're speaking so much about their
3:18
self um maybe when you're having conversations and it's so much about themsel um and you know when a person is
3:29
surrendered to God and has not grown uh spiritually has not become spiritually
3:35
mature sometimes people like to just talk to someone just to like feel heard and feel listened and so even the
3:42
conversations are really all about themselves so when you when you sense that kind of behavior like how
3:49
conversations are going um and then also if someone is is
3:54
gossiping if someone is talking badly about um
4:00
people uh talking badly about this is a this would be a really really big
4:06
indicator to not keep someone close if they're talking badly about um where
4:12
you're planted and your spiritual leader if they're
4:18
um acting like fake you know one one way in front of people in another way in
4:25
front of you um and then also when when the person is being disobedient
4:33
to God's ways and God's order so when you're sensing that a
4:40
person is is not being obedient to God's order if it's where you're planted for
4:47
example if there's disobedience in that area Disobedience to what is being
4:54
taught um Disobedience to being planted disobedience in the area of having a
5:01
servant heart and submitting under leadership when you notice these things
5:07
this is also an indicator of not surrender and so [Music]
5:14
um this is the this is the area of righteous uh judging righteously that the Bible talks about
5:20
so we are not called to be the judge and render verdicts on people but we are
5:26
only called to look at fruit towards people when it comes to how they
5:34
could be affecting our spiritual health and make those decisions whether to keep them close or not so when we are
5:41
supposed to be judging righteously as in looking at the fruits are they good
5:47
or are they bad and using wisdom and discernment to make these decisions with
5:53
the Holy Spirit helping you that's the meaning of judging righteously it's not meaning
5:58
like becoming a judge but it's really
6:03
when you need to make decisions of in in the case of your spiritual health for
6:10
decisions of the the church you're planted at your spiritual leader that's when you need to look you're not being
6:16
the judge but you're looking at the fruits and Discerning is this going to help me
6:23
spiritually or is it not that that's the meaning of judging righteously and then same for
6:30
um people that you bring in close you need to be judging righteously which is
6:35
to look at the fruits so you can look at the fruits and discern this person is
6:42
not actually surrendered to God there's disobedience in these areas it's not for you to
6:48
um take the place of correcting um it's not your place to to
6:56
gossip about them to others and judge a judge but it's for your own spiritual
7:02
health you are observing the fruits making the
7:07
decision so um it all comes down to
7:12
surrender and obedience to God so especially when you are planted
7:18
somewhere and if we're talking about people where you that are planted where you're planted there's going to be different levels of there's going to be
7:25
different kinds of um different different kinds of motives
7:30
you know most are going to be true sheep most are going to be having pure hearts and doing their
7:38
best to be obedient to God and to surrender but there can there will be some that have different motives there
7:45
will be some who are just
7:50
um choosing to be disobedient in some areas and so if you see that that's just
7:56
an indicator that there's not surrender there there's um continual sin happening
8:05
there and maybe hiding it um that should show you that God's not calling you to
8:11
keep that person in close because it could be detrimental for your spiritual health how do you transition out of
8:17
these relationships with love and grace um
8:23
well you know Jesus said my true family are those who
8:32
who serve God who obey God who do the will of my
8:37
father and he says this after his mother and brother want to
8:43
talk to him in the midst of him in the being in the middle of ministry and very important work of God but they were
8:49
concerned about this persecution when really God was saying plow through the
8:57
persecution keep going don't worry I'll fight your battles for you I'll protect
9:02
you just don't don't hide don't retreat keep going and so we have um we have the
9:10
mother of Jesus and his brother acting um you know kind of in their emotions at
9:15
this point not meaning they had like bad motives or anything but kind of acting in their emotions and um honestly like
9:23
kind of forgetting their place like Jesus was Lord and so even though Jesus was a baby at one time
9:29
and came from Mary's womb there had to be this transition of Mary seeing Jesus
9:35
as as as her Lord and leader over her son like these had to
9:44
Trump these had to be how she sees him even though it was her natural son um
9:52
and so it's like these emotions getting in the way of a mother of wanting to protect and um are you I don't know if
9:59
you're going to be safe and D you know and so in this moment it was it was you
10:04
know not really in line with God's will in that moment and so that's why Jesus
10:10
says this at this moment those only those who do the will of my father um
10:16
are my true family that's what he says in the word and um if you think about it when he
10:23
says that it seems kind of brash it seems maybe it could seem kind of harsh to some people
10:30
so it really it just shows us this example of the seriousness of serving
10:36
God and being in the will of the father and that has to be priority that must be
10:42
priority above everything else and so we have to remember that to not be ashamed
10:48
of that and to not be afraid of like hurting people's feelings um
10:55
because like whoever you bring in close like if you are surrendered to God and you're obeying God and you're serving
11:01
God your spiritual health is very important your spiritual protection is
11:07
very important and to have the wrong people in close is detrimental to your
11:13
spiritual health and protection you're not even called to have that many people in close so um to
11:20
bring the wrong person in close is is really harmful um so so you know you need to
11:29
know how important this is and not worry about hurting people's
11:35
feelings um they're the ones choosing to not surrender to God and be disobedient
11:42
you know so you you you have to keep that in mind all right at the same time
11:47
we love everyone we have Grace for everyone we we knew all many many of you
11:53
many of us used to be lukewarm used to not be um fully surrendered so we do
11:59
have so much grace but you have to remember just like the seriousness that
12:04
Jesus showed us of only the family we keep in close are the ones that are doing the will of the father you have to
12:12
remember like that has to be number one in your heart rather than like I don't want to hurt feelings and everything you
12:19
know um because you also have to be aware that like when people aren't surrendered
12:26
to God um there's other things that can be going on there can be manipulation going
12:34
on um I mean when you when anyone surrendered to God they're going to be
12:41
the most amazing friend that anybody's ever had because they're going to be so Godly so you're when you're surrender to
12:48
God you're valuable you're so valuable like people don't want to lose you as a close friend you know um and so when
12:55
someone's not surrendered to God of course they want to have a a
13:01
close friend who they can be mean to and treat however however they want and the
13:08
person will just be loving to them back you know what I mean like you have to be
13:15
aware like when you truly are being Godly how nobody wants to lose you as a
13:22
close friend right um and so you you need to not let yourself be like
13:29
trampled on and taken be taken advantage of you know you need to have value for
13:34
yourself for the glory of God you need to have value for yourself for the glory
13:40
of God um I remember I shared this with you
13:46
before but some with many of some of you before I've shared this in the past but when my spiritual father my now
13:53
spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy when he first prophesied to me my calling in September of eight years ago
14:00
this this coming September will be eight years um he he first prophesied my
14:05
calling that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and I was called to reach the Nations and the one thing
14:10
he said after that was I see scars on your heart of
14:17
how um men uh disvalued
14:24
[Music] you and didn't treat you right something like that
14:29
and he says you need to Value yourself a little bit for you to reach your calling
14:36
that I just prophesied and it really shocked me because I'm like value myself I
14:42
literally thought that I um had the highest standard more than any of my
14:48
Christian friends because at that point when he prophesied that I had
14:56
gone how many years was it I had gone about eight years without
15:02
having a boyfriend and that was purely because of having a high standard number two
15:10
because God protected me because hilarious praise God that he
15:16
protected me um because of course there was some there were some times where maybe I
15:23
liked someone but they didn't they didn't have the same feelings back so
15:29
was also definitely God it was not just my high standard but when he said that
15:35
it made me it opened up my eyes that
15:40
um I I needed to value my worth even more you know I really
15:47
did and so I share that with you so you can apply that in terms of any
15:54
relationships friendships too um because I I think it's really
15:59
powerful that that was the only other thing that was prophesied to me when my
16:06
calling came it was like but you won't reach your calling if you don't value
16:11
yourself and you bring the wrong people close when even I thought I had a really
16:17
high standard let that speak to you let that speak to
16:25
you so um you know you need to like have value for yourself for the glory of
16:32
God like you need to have that understanding of if I bring the wrong people in
16:37
close God can't use me how he wants I'm not going to be able to reach the
16:43
calling that he has for me so you have to like really like value yourself and
16:49
then it will help you to see that um see see rightly people you know
16:55
instead of seeing them with a religious lens of like um I don't know I mean I don't I say
17:02
religious because um like sometimes in the area of religion
17:08
it's like there it's it's like there's not
17:16
the wisdom in the area of religion sometimes of like how serious we must be
17:21
in obedience to God and instead it can be like don't hurt anyone's feelings we have to love everybody it can be like
17:28
kind of that that's kind of like the old wine you know not having that wisdom and
17:33
seriousness of surrender and obedience to God but having more of um people
17:40
pleasing um so so yeah so uh you know
17:46
we're only called to bring in a few people close to us if that depending on
17:51
the season just because just as Jesus showed us the example that he only brought three close disciples with him
17:57
they were the ones on the Mount of transfiguration and in in the Garden of Gethsemane and then beyond those three there's only 12 he kept semi close and
18:03
those were his 12 disciples but there's only three that came in super close so that's a good example for us uh that we
18:11
shouldn't have that many and so if the the ones that do come really close really need to be just like how Jesus's
18:19
really close ones were they were the most spiritually mature and surrendered they need to be surrendered to
18:25
God um so anyways back to the question how do we do this with Ling Grace so don't be afraid to
18:33
say you know maybe if you you you used to hang out with them a lot or talk on the phone with with them a lot just
18:39
don't be afraid to put up boundaries with love and with Grace and you can say something like the Lord is really
18:46
calling me to spend a lot more time with him and serve
18:52
him this is a new season he's called me to and this means that I'm not going to
18:57
be available like I used to be um but I love you so much and I'm praying for you
19:05
um and I just wanted you to know it's it will be it'll look different like our
19:10
relationship from now because of these because of the Season that God is calling me to and the time that um I
19:16
need to give him you can share something like that and
19:22
um and uh someone who's not manipulative will completely respect that
19:29
they will see oh wow this is serious and so I'm just going to step back and wait
19:34
till they reach out because it's like God's calling them to do this um so woo I I respect that you know
19:44
that's how a person should respond and so really how a person should respond is
19:49
they're not going to reach out until the other person reaches out you know um or if they do reach out it's just to say I
19:57
love you miss you or something but not like can we hang out now you know but so
20:03
so if a person is you know not respecting what you said and just
20:08
continuing to ask can you hang out now can you you know have the discernment to see this
20:17
person is not valuing what God has called me to do that's not good there
20:23
could be manipulation here you know have that discernment and value yourself and
20:29
don't feel bad and don't feel like awkward like oh oh no like this is
20:34
awkward like they're asking me to hang out and like I have to say no again like
20:40
grow up spiritually and take on that that heart that Jesus had my true family
20:45
are those who will do the will of the father and nothing matters more than doing the will of my father so that
20:51
means I'm not going to please everybody that means I'm going to make people upset sometimes but I don't care all all
20:58
that matters is serving God and OB obeying him what is the
21:04
kingdom order of receiving promises from God how do we know what our promises of
21:09
God are and not just our own
21:15
desires so first of all the promises of God is the inheritance that God has giv
21:21
you when you become a child of God which is an inheritance of Abundant Life healing Freedom provision protection
21:30
and um abundance in all those areas like in the area of provision not
21:36
just enough to pay the bills but more so you can bless others and contribute more
21:42
to the kingdom of God so those are the main promises that you know are
21:51
yours they're everybody's and then the other
21:57
promises um depend upon the person's calling um some of these promises are
22:05
having to do completely with your purpose so some of these promises you
22:10
may not know they may not be revealed until later until God's perfect
22:16
timing now for me logically like with the calling that God has given me
22:22
logically you know my parents were Christians my parents were humble so humble
22:29
like never skeptical childlike so logically like if I knew if
22:39
um I don't know like if God was like okay I'm going to call you to be an apostle I'm going to call you to be an
22:45
apostle of the Nations and D um and I was like okay like how should this go like
22:53
how should I be prepared for this logically um I'd probably say okay
23:00
like even before I'm born introduce my parents to um those few Servants of God out
23:08
there who carry anointing and carry the new wine Revelation because it was out
23:14
there when I was born already not hugely prevalent across the world you know um
23:21
but it was out there some places and some people and so
23:26
logically yeah I was born and it was prophesied when I was born or when I was
23:32
five or when I a young age this is your huge calling and then I could have been like
23:41
Jesus you know in the temple in the temp in the synagogues learning you know from
23:47
a young age um and I could have had 20 something
23:54
years of growing in the new wine
23:59
before it was time for me to start fful church and ministering like logically
24:04
maybe that's the plan that I would come up with you know but even though I was so open I was so open my whole life I
24:12
would have loved to encounter the power of God when I was a child but guess what it didn't happen
24:19
till I was in my mid 20s when the the the promise was spoken
24:25
to me the prophecy was spoken to me and um when my first my eyes first open up
24:32
to the power of God and so then all these promises were released to me the promises and these prophecies and
24:38
Promises came through my spiritual father for my own life and for LA and
24:44
the America and the world about Revival and all these promises that I never even
24:50
dreamt about they were way too bigger than my dreams all of these promises even in my
24:56
personal life promises that I never imagined they were just plopped from God
25:02
and so I say that all to say is that um when it comes to the promises for your
25:08
own personal life and having to do with your calling and
25:13
even just ways that God wants to bless you like some of these promises are having to do with like how God wants to
25:19
bless me but also helping for his kingdom for his glory
25:25
um but they might not be released yet to you is what I'm trying to say they might
25:31
not have been released to you yet they may be released later so you have to be
25:37
patient when you when you're waiting still on like more specific direction of
25:44
um the the like real real like how you're used to
25:53
your greatest capacity because you know you're calling now you're calling is to
25:58
be a servant of God to be used in his anointing as a servant and that's just what you're supposed to be focused on
26:03
you're not supposed to think like be thinking so much what's my calling
26:09
what's my calling what's my calling because when when it's not God's timing to release that that could be a real distraction when you're
26:15
idolizing um trying to find your specific calling your calling is to be a servant
26:22
of God and serve just serve him just serve him contribute to the work of God
26:28
and then as you do that God will release more to you he maybe he'll send you okay
26:34
I want you to do this now and I want you to do this now he'll and then as time goes on you'll get to this point of whoa
26:42
like this is my purpose I mean you're already fulfilling your purpose right now by serving God but you'll feel even
26:48
more of like oh wow just like before um like wow this is this is my calling you
26:57
know but don't don't worry about that right now you're are it's not like you're waiting to find your calling
27:02
you're already beginning to to fulfill your purpose and calling right now it's
27:08
just that more will unfold later and you'll be able to be used even more at a greater capacity as time goes on like
27:16
for me I was a Believer and I was I had a gift of singing and songwriting and I
27:22
was making music and I was beginning to fil fulfill my purpose as being a light to the world and being a vessel of the
27:28
Holy Spirit bringing peace and joy and talking about Jesus leading others Jesus I was already starting to fulfill my
27:35
calling but then more was unveiled revealed um things I didn't know that
27:42
was inside of me you know gifts that God had put that needed the the prophecies to unlock and um a
27:51
spiritual father to unlock and impartation to unlock um so you'll have
27:56
other things inside of you that will will be unlocked as time goes on but you can't rush God's timing just be content
28:06
that you were already fulfilling your purpose and this is the way to to to to to have more revealed is by
28:14
just staying focused on serving God Amen um and then when it comes to the
28:19
promises like that that there will be some the Bible says Delight in the Lord with all Delight Delight in the Lord and
28:27
He will give you the desires of your heart so there may be some things God spoken
28:34
to your spirit like to have to have a family to have children he might have
28:41
spoken that to your spirit and he he asked us to surrender everything so our
28:46
dreams which even are can be Promises of God but to still Just Surrender it in terms of just putting it in God's hands
28:54
and just being humble like I believe you've spoken this that is it it's a
28:59
it's a desire of my heart that you want to give to me but even so I humble myself and I give it to you I don't hold
29:04
on to it stubbornly like this is the desire of my heart that God's going to give give me I take this
29:12
desire of my heart that I believe that God wants to give me but I still give it to God I and I and I humble myself for
29:18
the chance that maybe God has something different planned right so
29:25
um you know you you give that to God and then you you just let go and
29:32
you and and holy spirit will speak to you like holy spirit will speak to your spirit many times and reveal thank you
29:39
for giving this to me I do want to bless you with this but I don't want you to idolize it I want you to just rest and
29:46
focus on what I have for you in this season I don't want you to be looking so much into the next season that you're
29:51
missing this season these gifts like if it's a family like if it's children and I've done that I've done that like
29:58
like it's so amazing and freeing to just give it to God and so I I don't find my
30:04
mind thinking of these desires of my heart or whatever in the past I you know
30:10
I'm just like in God's timing if he wants to do it it's there but I'm going
30:16
to find my contentment in this season with Jesus I'm going to give all of myself to serving him in this season and
30:25
I know there's blessings coming in the future I know there's promises desires of my heart that are coming in the future but I've put them in God's hands
30:33
for safekeeping and I'm giving him control and letting him do whatever he wants with them and in the timing but I
30:39
do know this that God has so many blessings beyond my wildest dreams in store in the future and I I am excited
30:47
for them I don't focus on them too much because I want to make sure I'm not distracted I I'm there's so much to Give
30:54
My All In in this present time in this season right now amen stores are neutral space but if
31:03
I receive clients at home for consultations is that my territory or a
31:08
neutral space well what if you're like a store owner or if you're um working
31:16
somewhere um when people come in it's this neutral space where people in their
31:21
own free will they're just coming and they want to buy things for example um
31:28
but sometimes a person might be in the place where they're open to finding God
31:34
to hearing more about God sometimes you might start to have a conversation and
31:40
it just leads to talking about God and this person's really open and if in
31:46
their own free will they want to go that direction they want to hear more about God or you you start sharing your
31:52
testimony and they um they share this
31:57
desire to be set free like you were set free things can move to where you can
32:02
ask can I would you like me to pray for you I believe God wants to deliver you and could deliver you
32:09
now um and they say yes then that can be a time according with wisdom like
32:15
according with wisdom uh like
32:21
um you know being aware of your surroundings is what I mean um you know
32:27
to not be forceful about it but if if it allows if if if it allows if it's if
32:35
you're able to say to to pray for them if that's what um they're
32:42
Desiring then you can do that but like in your home it's kind of the same thing
32:48
if it's a store happening in your home like if it's a business happening in your home because the PE it's all having
32:55
to do with free will so because the people are coming with with with the intention to just do
33:01
business or whatever it's not for you to think this is my territory so it's like they're stepping into church no now they
33:09
can start to open up and desire God and desire prayer for example and you can pray for them in your home but it's like
33:16
you know when I'm ministering at church and people come to
33:23
church the church is 100% to do the work of God the church is not forbid business
33:29
the church is is not a neutral space the church is not a coffee shop the church is not a hangout spot but the church
33:35
100% is for is to do the work of God and it's advertised that way you know on our website so when people come it's the
33:44
action of them saying I want God I want
33:50
prayer and so that's why if I declare I'm declaring over everybody I'm not
33:55
saying only those who in their free will want prayer this prayer is for no it they're
34:02
coming to church all right so that that's a church is a different circumstance but when
34:08
we're talking about neutral C circumstances um planes on the Street
34:15
businesses you really have to it's different than people coming to church we can't just be like I have a word for
34:22
you like you know we really have to respect people's free will and plant
34:29
seeds and show love and see what they do with that if they desire more and all of
34:36
a sudden position themselves spiritually to receive Ministry through You by their Free Will actions
34:45
words Desiring more of this love of God that you're showing if a family member
34:51
doesn't want you to share their Deliverance should we respect that or follow the holy spirit's leading
34:58
um well for everyone who comes to church
35:03
like as I mentioned there there's cameras it's known that this place is
35:10
for God's glory everything that happens the Deliverance everything that happens is for God's glory um and so we have to we have to
35:20
stand strong in that and not worry about people pleasing you know when it comes to the church but when it comes to your
35:28
own family members um there's it's a it's good to
35:33
walk in wisdom because you are very crucial
35:39
to like you as a vessel of God are very crucial to that person to the family
35:45
member coming closer to God repenting Desiring more so you have to use wisdom
35:52
like if they all of a sudden you know just are don't want their video shown
35:58
and you're is a close family member you don't have to show it in that season you
36:03
can share about it with wisdom verbally you know but
36:09
um if that's really bothering them that would be wisdom to you know to
36:16
respect that if it's a close family member um just knowing that you are so
36:23
crucial like your gentleness and showing the love of God to them and respecting
36:28
them is so crucial for God to use you to
36:33
bring them closer so you can just have in your heart I am sharing this but when the
36:40
time is right you know God must get the glory through this but you walk in this wisdom
36:48
to uh show it in the right time but still testify with wisdom in the right
36:55
time verbally and everything is it okay to baptize twice um yes like so
37:04
basically when you are being when you are being baptized this is a time where you
37:10
are committing your life to Jesus and sometimes people could have just you
37:16
could have just gone through the motion sometimes you were a baby that's how I was baptized as a baby so I was then baptized later when I could make the
37:22
decision for myself it should be the your own decision is how it should be um
37:28
um so because you are making that decision it's a it's an outward expression of what you've done
37:36
inwardly so the inward should happen first before the outward you know so
37:42
sometimes the outward happens and you haven't really you know if you're a baby for example or if you're just going through the motions or you're lukewarm
37:48
you've just gone through the motions being baptized but inwardly you weren't like really I'm committing my whole life
37:56
to Jesus so you should be baptized um again if you have if if when
38:04
you were baptized before it inside it wasn't really genuine
38:09
yet and also like some people may be I know a lot of people that come to fful
38:14
church we had when the last time we had the baptism service um you know a lot of
38:20
people they had been baptized before but they weren't fully surrendered and they came to fivefold church and then they
38:26
became surrendered and and just feel for some for many people feeling like they
38:32
are planted where they're supposed to be planted and they're where the anointing is for the first time and also they've
38:39
surrendered now they really felt it was right to be
38:44
baptized where they were planted so yes absolutely what if we feel God's love in
38:52
people who are not wise to keep in our life well I want to answer first like
38:57
what if you feel God's heart for that person that you're not called to bring in close so we are called to love
39:03
everyone so those that we're not called to bring them close we are still called to love them but many people think that
39:10
um the only way to love people is relationally and and close close
39:16
relationally wise but that's not true
39:23
um for example I love you all very
39:29
much and so many of you are my spiritual children and I have not been able to
39:38
have a one-on-one conversation with most of you but I love you so much and I know
39:46
I'm showing the love of God to you by ministering to
39:52
you and being obedient to God with everything I do whether it's working to for everything that we
39:59
Post online to minister to you or writing my book you know or just
40:06
sacrificing all wherever God called me to sacrifice so I can be the most anointed vessel of God for you for your
40:13
benefit you know so this is just one example of how like there's very few
40:19
people that I can be with close that I'm close to
40:24
relationally um but I I have so much love for so many people and so many
40:29
people are able to experience God's love through me glory to God um and so but we're not all called
40:37
to like public Ministry for example of course but I just wanted to share like this is me shining the light this is me
40:42
doing what God's calling me to do and as I do what God's called me to do my light
40:47
can shine brighter and my light can reach farther and I can be more effective for the Kingdom so
40:54
um I tell you what like just you shining your light on social media there's a lot
41:00
of your friends and family that you aren't called to keep close people from the past but they see you on social
41:06
media they follow you still on social media and you know you
41:12
sharing videos posts God moving and power through them it's going to touch them it's going to lead them to Jesus
41:19
it's going to open up their eyes to God's love and so that's a more effective powerful way to love many many
41:26
people than trying to bring everyone in relationally closely which ends
41:32
up ends up keeping you from being at full capacity and protected so
41:39
that God can pour His anointing in you more and keep you
41:46
focused amen and you know
41:54
like sometimes people from my past they'll just like like want to like hang out and like people from my past like
42:01
people from years ago or but they don't come to church and it's like you're not taking god
42:08
seriously you know like you can't just have me as a
42:13
friend but not be serious about
42:19
God you know and so people need to to show that they're
42:25
serious about God to get this close access to you you know
42:33
all right when it comes to me
42:39
sharing adding to my story things
42:45
um sometimes things are missed first of all I can't see everything that I'm
42:51
tagged in um and secondly it's very important
42:57
we don't become entitled to have what we share be added onto the story of my
43:04
Ministry of five full church it's very important we are humble and we don't have in our hearts you know why isn't
43:13
what I tagged being shared because that's entitlement amen we must have
43:18
humility all right and so everything that is shared on my post is for the glory of God is testimonies and so if
43:26
you look on the story we should just be praising God rather than thinking about
43:31
ourselves um and uh that's just very important you know whenever we are are
43:40
feeling those feelings it's a heart check to make sure we are being humble
43:45
and and and remembering that we aren't entitled we are we are here to be you
43:52
are here to receive and you you are here to help contribute to the work of God
43:57
and you're not owed anything you know um in terms of position in terms of um
44:04
getting attention or anything like that and we should have the opposite Hearts
44:09
we should have the hearts of servants servants that should be in our heart
44:15
amen and so if anything like that goes on in your heart it's time for a heart check it's time for God to Search Your
44:21
Heart allow God to search your heart and just ask him for help to clean your
44:27
heart to make sure that your mind and your heart is always focused on being a servant and not to be
44:34
seen amen how to pray for family members who are lukewarm and don't know about the
44:40
new wine if they share about their
44:46
sickness um so just simply share testimonies just simp like without
44:53
pressure like instead of you know just because you know they lukewarm just meet them where they're at like don't don't
45:01
try to like show like you're on a mission to preach to them you know just
45:06
be chill and gentle and just share from your heart you know when they share with
45:12
you you're they're struggling with the sickness just share with them hey you know do you know about like Jesus's
45:19
Ministry in the gospels and just how he was healing people of everything and do
45:24
you know about how in the acts Church he told his disciples to do the same
45:29
thing to heal the sick too um and to cast out demons too and
45:35
that they'll do even greater things than him and do you know that like they did that too they they were healing by God's
45:41
power all kinds of diseases and casting out all kinds of demons like do you know that depending on how lukewarm lukewarm
45:47
they are I mean if they're call themselves a Christian with they're lukewarm they'll probably know about this these stories but remind them and
45:54
just share you know what I've seen some shocking testimonies that
46:02
is the Bible come alive right now I've heard a person this is happening right
46:09
now through uh at fivefold church for example I'm I'm seeing these things happen it's a church in LA
46:17
and it's actually like gone viral like with these testimonies because it's just
46:24
true fruit it's going viral it's true it's it's true and it's so shocking and so rare in this time of time of age but
46:32
it's the Bible come alive for example I've heard testimonies of people testifying they were healed of cancer
46:39
they were delivered from addiction they were delivered from depression they were delivered from anxiety they were
46:45
delivered from epilepsy they were delivered from Suicidal Thoughts The Thought seats many children delivered
46:51
from autism um a person healed of this that
46:57
all all sorts of things and if you need a refresher you can go to my YouTube page and I have a
47:04
testimonies playlist which has um so many hundreds of testimonies you can
47:11
have a refresher so you can write out a list and um just share it you know and
47:19
the Bible says by his stripes you're healed that means even though we haven't seen it by and large today this is what
47:26
God wants to do and he's doing it it means that he paid a price for you to be
47:32
healed with faith this is what happened in the Bible when people had Faith they were healed and these testimonies that
47:37
we're hearing about that I'm sharing with you it's because people believed so if you believe God can heal you you know
47:44
just be gentle with them and chill you know like just come from the heart you
47:51
know meet them where they're at and um just relaxed and Just sh share your
47:57
heart and as you just like share your heart and allow the gentleness that's
48:02
why I say chill the gentleness of God to come through you the kindness of
48:07
God it can't not do something and it canot plant seeds it has to plant some sort of seeds
48:15
amen recently I typed traumatizing experiences experiences I had with a person in my phone just to get it out of
48:21
my head and suddenly I felt a demon manifesting and lifting off of me how did that happen I didn't renounce so if
48:28
you are planted where the anointing is um the anointing is is moving in your
48:34
life powerfully and the thing is is that one of the thing to know about God is he's not
48:41
religious so when we're talking about his principles and his ways they aren't religious meaning they're not legalistic
48:49
and Technical
48:54
um like like it you said that you wrote down
49:00
things to get it out of your head so to me when you say that it sounds like you were taking the action of resisting the
49:08
devil's lies and saying I don't want this in my mind anymore I don't want this traumatic
49:14
experience in my life I'm I'm rejecting it I'm getting out that was the action you took and so to me it looks like in
49:22
the spiritual realm it was the action of renouncing even though you didn't specifically say I renounce it's good to
49:27
be speaking the words I renounce for these things and it would be good even after you felt the demon lift off of you
49:33
to still speak it to like really concrete it in but because God's not
49:39
legalistic and religious things don't have to be so
49:46
particular you know like that's why sometimes sometimes
49:52
if I just say this demon must go I am saying it in Jesus name but I don't always have to say in Jesus name and
49:59
sometimes I can say be free I sometimes I don't have to exactly say this Spirit
50:05
of this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this must go you know and I and I plead the blood of
50:12
Jesus over you like you don't have to make it so Technical and legalistic and
50:19
ritualistic like I have to say this word or the the demon doesn't go God's not like that it it's really just
50:29
walking in the truth and taking the action and intention um and speaking the words when
50:34
necessary that's what counts not like the particulars is it okay to hang out with
50:40
someone occasionally in order to show love and light to them but not get personal and close with a person you
50:45
just got to walk in wisdom and you just got to like with this Revelation that I've released you got to really carry this in your heart like you got to know
50:51
the seriousness of it so um you know you just really got to walk in wisdom you
50:58
know don't take it don't take it too lightly um spending time with a person oneon-one
51:07
um just don't take it just tread lightly it's it's really a new level of surrender and sacrifice and new wine um
51:16
so just walk with wi walk in wisdom and just be aware you know just be aware
51:23
of maybe things they say or things that could be um harmful to you spiritually
51:32
and that's going to be a red flag and indicator leading you to walk in wisdom like oh I need to put more boundaries up
51:38
here you know so it just depends on the situation and the season it depends on the situation and the season that God
51:45
has you in oh and I also just want to say like um in regards to that like is it okay to
51:52
hang out with a person sometimes and just not bring them in too close in order to show them love um you also need
51:58
to like know like you're called to there's so many people on this Earth and
52:05
there needs to be what like a person can be are you going to continue to spend
52:12
time with somebody for years and they after sewing seeds after being when
52:19
you hang out with this person it should be 100% intention to minister like 100% intention it shouldn't be like to hang
52:25
out because because they're fun to hang out with that should only be for the people you're bringing in close that God's
52:32
called you to bring in close those people you can have fun with you know it's you know but like if there's
52:38
someone that you're hanging out with it you need to have in your mind this is a 100% Ministry mode if you have in your
52:45
mind like oh this person's fun to hang out with even though like they don't serve God believe Earth surrender to God
52:52
they're fun hang out with so I'm looking forward to this I'm going to hang out with that's like when you're like letting your guard down you know um and
52:58
that's like you you if God is calling you to do this you need to have that intention this is Ministry completely
53:05
like I'm I'm spending time with this person right now the in my heart in my mind the whole time is going to be to minister to them I don't mean to preach
53:11
to them necessarily but I mean like the Let Let My Words Be purposeful I'm going
53:17
to be selfless and I'm going to pour love and encourage them and if they ask me about my life I'm going to make sure
53:22
I'm sharing about like testimonies like about what I'm passionate about about God and so if that person is responding
53:31
and like like positively like they want to know more about God that's an indicator okay this is a
53:38
fruitful um Ministry time uh relationship to have to
53:45
occasionally spend time with this person that's an indicator and so if if there's fruit
53:51
coming you can keep doing that but really like being on guard and really
53:57
with the intention this is for Ministry not for like my personal gain and because this person's want to hang out
54:03
with and stuff um and then you know but you got to be wise because you can just
54:09
be going through the motions just because you've been friends with somebody forever and you just have this tradition of hanging out with them once
54:14
a week once a month whatever and then for years go by and they're not coming any closer to
54:19
God you're so valuable like you there's a lot of people in this world and if
54:25
this one person who who just in their own free will is not grabbing the seeds that you're planting and is rejecting
54:31
them then that that time you're spending with them could be
54:38
spent pouring out your love and Ministry to someone who will receive
54:43
it and that so so like you can't be everywhere at once you know what I mean
54:49
and so that's one of the big reasons why God's called me to this this like life of not having tons of like relationships
54:55
is like I have to focus on where the seeds will
55:01
be will are wanted and fruit will be produced you know like Jesus says to his
55:07
disciples if the people don't receive you dust your feet off and leave so you
55:12
need to like really be aware of this this is spiritual this is like new wine spiritual what I'm saying it's not
55:20
traditional life traditional life is like you've been chill with somebody your whole life and you just just keep
55:27
them close in your life your whole life you know and that's the old way but you got to see yourself with so much like
55:33
value and like if you if you allow God to like close a door for example then
55:40
God opens up another door God can bring someone else um in your life and and and
55:45
also all of these things are testings like all of these things like all of these areas of will you take it
55:51
seriously this like everyday obedience to God if you will take this seriously
55:58
then it's a test if you pass the tests then God can entrust you entrust to
56:06
you amazing Godly Hearts to be in close relationship with but if you stay stuck
56:12
and you don't you're not obedient to God and and even like these small things that don't seem like much a big deal you
56:17
know then it's like failing a test and so God wants to bring this amazing like
56:24
Godly friend in your life that will help that will help edify you
56:30
and iron sharpen iron but he can't because he needs you to be on the same level as them in terms of this obedience
56:38
with everything amen and yes I know whenever
56:44
I talk about this people always wonder about family who live close to you so I know there's this question here what a family who lives with you in this week
56:49
negatively all the time it's unavoidable when you can't change a living situation
56:55
and God's grace is there so just do your best to make boundaries do your best to um reject any
57:03
negative word spoken and um see that this is a refining fire this like
57:10
unavoidable situation you know where people are close to you that aren't surrender to God they're speaking negatively if there's not a way to like
57:17
have your own place like maybe it's you're under 18 and you're living with your parents for example this a
57:22
situation like that um you know just see it for what it is God is using
57:29
this for my good he's using this to refine me he's using this as a as a opportunity to love people who are who
57:37
are being used by the enemy sometimes who are not treating me with the love of God all the time you know God's using it
57:44
as a chance for me to love when it's hard to love my enemies and just focus
57:50
on loving them loving them with the love of Christ and because God loves them and wants them wants them to come to him and
57:55
God allowing you to be there also to be the light for them so remember I'm a light
58:01
here I am a light here and show them the kindness and love of God because the
58:07
kindness is what leads to repentance amen thank you Lord I declare
58:15
right now that any kind of problem in your body or in your spiritual life that
58:22
it would be removed right now I speak healing to you to your whole body I release healing and I speak Freedom over
58:30
anyone who is struggling in some area in their mind struggling with oppression the oppression must be broken it must go
58:38
and I speak freedom to you in Jesus name I release this anointing over you now
58:44
and I speak peace to fill you and uh
58:50
wisdom to increase that as you go through your day today
58:56
that you would really hear the holy spirit's voice and be led by him that
59:01
you would walk every day led by the spirit in Jesus name and I impart this
59:07
wisdom to you in jesus' name let this wisdom grow let these words that were
59:14
released let it grow more Let it help
59:19
you discern even other situations because of this wisdom that you have received because what has been deposited
59:25
in you let it grow let the wisdom grow for different situations that weren't even talked about today in Jesus
59:32
name thank you Jesus and I speak this anointing to come upon you and fill you with strength to be obedient to God to
59:40
serve God to never compromise in Jesus name amen
