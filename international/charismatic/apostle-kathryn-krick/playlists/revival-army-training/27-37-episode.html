I've been doing a series on my book The Secret of the
0:05
anointing which came out recently um and if you haven't gotten it
0:11
definitely get it to be equipped because God wants you to be a vessel of of his power and you have to be equipped you
0:18
need your spiritual eyes to open up you need to know the secrets or we can also call them
0:24
Revelations mysteries in the spiritual realm uh you you can't be walking in the
0:30
of God and fulfilling your purpose with a carnal mind you need your eyes opened up you
0:36
need to become spiritual you need to be matured spiritually amen I started teaching on impartation what it is the
0:44
power of it and today is really a part two about impartation
0:50
specifically how to receive impartation a lot of people think it's
0:57
just about going and finding an anointed one and asking them to lay their hand on you but it's much more than that
1:05
amen there are principles in this spiritual realm that unlock the
1:12
impartation of anointing to come in your life and that's what I'm going to teach on today
1:18
amen hallelujah so first of all I am going to
1:24
share this from my own personal experience not something that I've just
1:29
like read a textbook or I've heard from someone else but I'm sharing from my own personal experience the Miracles that
1:36
you just heard about today the Miracles you've experienced that have come from the anointing of Jesus flowing through
1:42
through me for his glory has only come because I have received
1:50
impartation I mentioned how there's two ways to receive the anointing from God
1:55
and the main way is through impartation the other rare way is when
2:02
God just gives it um directly in this revival uh the main way
2:09
the big way that God is going to be releasing the anointing is through impartation um so my spiritual father
2:17
Prophet Dr Jord Davy he lives in Tanzania East Africa has a massive Ministry there of several thousands who
2:24
come every week and it is just like this but more thousands of people and I mean
2:29
it's just Miracles upon Miracles Deliverance healing the power of God moving every
2:36
time and he's been ministering for many decades now he's had this church for many decades and been walking in the
2:42
power of God for a long time ever since 2004 now he is one of those um uh rare
2:50
instances of the anointing coming straight directly from God without a vessel so what happened was he was
2:58
called to be a prophet since birth and Prophets true prophets are actually called since birth in pretty much every
3:06
circumstance most most circumstances they are called since birth and when he was a young child he would say things
3:13
and they would happen and his mother would notice these things and notice there was something different about him
3:19
he never went into the world at all um he grew up in a religious
3:26
household and when he was in his teens he went to a church that uh had the Holy
3:34
Spirit and that's where he had his first encounter with the Holy Spirit and then when he went and told his parents who
3:40
were religious who didn't know about the Holy Spirit they rejected him and kicked
3:45
him out because the spirit of religion was so offended and um so he lived a life in
3:52
poverty for a while being kicked out at a young age a a pastor took him in and
3:57
and he would say a pastor his pastors for a while and then he he began doing
4:04
music Ministry uh singing songs for goding and worship then he was take he he took care
4:13
of Street children uh which are there in in Africa there's many children who are
4:19
orphans and they're on the street they've been abandoned and he had such a heart for him so he had an organization
4:26
and took them in clothed them fed them and and took care of them and he did that for many years and he's never
4:32
stopped taking care of the orphans and giving so much to the orphans there in Tanzania and Beyond and so then he began
4:40
to Pastor well actually he was doing uh itinerate speaking as a minister and
4:46
then he began to Pastor his own church and so he began really in
4:52
Ministry in his 20s his early 20s he never went into the world he never uh d
4:59
bed into the world at all he was pure his whole life and God was really preparing him
5:06
all that time many many years many years of living a Pure Life never going in the
5:11
world serving God even serving him in the church for several years until one
5:17
day when he was in his late 30s 2004 he was about to go minister at a
5:23
conference when Jesus appeared to him and he he just just appeared like from
5:30
here up he had this huge smile on his face and he was holding a ring of
5:37
keys and all of these Keys had different names of different kinds of religion
5:44
denominations tons of different kinds of religion and denominations and Jesus
5:50
says Jor his name is Jord Davy but he said Jor I'm giving you the keys to
5:56
unlock my people from religion [Applause]
6:05
Hallelujah go into all of the world walk in my power preach the gospel heal the
6:11
sick cast out demons and he had a Hu he had had big huge smile on his face like
6:17
the biggest smile and full of love that he'd ever seen in his life and with that he
6:22
vanished and so then the the next morning he went out to minister okay and be prior to that he
6:30
had not seen the power of God work in him he was like normal ministers you know um he did have these signs of uh of
6:39
uh the prophetic but just these signs here and there but that morning he went
6:45
he stepped out to minister and the spiritual realm was just opened up he could see all of the
6:53
issues of people in the spiritual realm and it he and then was also full of such
6:59
faith and and he would just say someone in a wheelchair Get Up Stand Up and they would walk out of their wheelchair and
7:06
Hallelujah and so so many miracles happened that day after Jesus appeared
7:13
to him they they brought him to the hospital I mean it Revival broke out they brought him to the hospital to pray
7:19
for the sick people and Revival broke out I mean um his church grew uh to I
7:28
believe it was is 1,000 in about one year and the next year I believe it is about
7:35
3,000 and the power of God never stopped moving so mightily through him since that
7:42
day and that was in his late 30s so you can see this long journey that God took
7:48
him through to come in this unique way not via impartation that's something you
7:53
uh something about impartation when you have a spiritual father or mother um they they make it so things don't have
8:00
to take so long they bring shortcuts to you they give you wisdom like right away
8:08
you know and at the same time there's also accountability there so it's like
8:14
when there's when when it's when God does it another way there's this longer process this longer process of living a
8:21
long Pure Life and so then he can entrust amen so um that's the story of
8:29
my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy how the anointing was released upon him
8:35
he had other spiritual a spiritual father before that but for his calling it was unique he had this calling of of
8:42
like Moses so even though Moses might have had other leaders mentors before him Moses was uh like above the above
8:50
them it's a unique case you know so that's how it happened with him so then
8:57
uh that would was back in 2004 when that began and his ministry still has
9:04
thousands to this day several thousand about 3 to 5,000 depending come every single week and I've been there several
9:10
times and when I first came I was in awe I've never seen heaven on Earth like I saw it there which now I'm I'm Overjoyed
9:19
to see it here now I've seen yes just um
9:25
the just the immense Joy because God's God's presence and power is there always
9:33
the immense joy that people are being freed healed touched and transformed I
9:39
never had seen rejoicing and worshiping God like I saw there and giving God glory like I'd seen there Hallelujah so
9:49
uh as many of you know my story for some of you that don't know I will share briefly my story how I was uh searching
9:58
for my calling on this Earth and I thought I had found it I thought I was going to I thought I was called to be a
10:04
singer songwriter a pop EDM Christian singer songwriter and I was pursuing
10:10
that I surrendered to God um about eight years ago upon encountering his power
10:16
for the first time and my spiritual eyes opening up and I surrendered everything
10:22
and I was a Christian my whole life but when I encountered God's power it changed everything it finally opened up
10:28
my eyes to really see God's love for me and his nearness for me and really just
10:33
be able to finally begin to comprehend how big he is How Majestic he is how
10:40
Almighty he is and how tiny I am and how he's the Creator and I'm the creation
10:46
and just it clicked to me all of a sudden like who am I to know what's best for my life who am I to not give my
10:53
whole life to God and so I did that I did that finally eight years ago
10:59
and I told God I will do whatever I give you my dreams my will my plan everything
11:05
and God answered that prayer 9 months later when I went to a conference in La
11:10
called a prophetic healing conference and it was my spiritual father who I didn't know yet Prophet Dr Davy who who
11:17
had come from Tanzania East Africa to minister there in LA and I saw him Minister and I had I had only at that
11:25
point it it's been nine months of seen God's power move I began to see it through different Ministries but when I
11:30
saw the power of God move through him it was a whole other level I was shocked at
11:35
how quickly demons went I was shocked at the prophetic anointing flowing through
11:41
him and touching people I was so shocked and uh
11:46
there God used him to speak to me he prophesied to me that I was actually
11:51
called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and I was called to reach the Nations
11:57
and God was going to do many miracles through me me this word came through him this prophecy for my life I knew that it
12:04
was a true prophet of God my spirit knew I had seen the fruits and God was speaking to my spirit this is a true
12:11
prophet of God and he is speaking to you now from me on my behalf and I want you
12:18
to receive this I heard this deep in my spirit and I did not want to be a minister I did not want to be an apostle
12:26
my biggest passion N9 months prior once I first encountered God's power was to
12:31
see other people encounter God's power cuz it set me on fire and I knew that
12:36
that was what I was missing my whole Christian Life and I saw every single
12:41
one of my other Christian friends and family I had like hundreds of them at this point probably from all the college
12:48
high school study abroad different churches in La I had so many Christian friends at that point and my heart
12:53
burned for them to encounter God's power because I knew pretty much all of them had had not encountered God God's power
12:59
and I saw them how I used to be lukewarm and not surrendered and on fire for
13:04
Jesus and so my biggest passion became for others to encounter God's
13:12
power I just I just had no clue that God wanted to use me that thought never
13:19
crossed my mind never cuz I'd only seen like a couple people walk in the power of God
13:25
and I saw myself as not some spirit ually amazing person at all I just saw
13:32
myself as a normal Christian and I definitely could never see myself as a preacher or any kind of public speaker
13:39
being before never could I picture that ever I promise but when I heard this word I
13:46
felt like Moses god reminded me of Moses remember Moses thought God was crazy cuz
13:51
they had a stutter but God says I'm calling you I don't care what you think
13:57
I made your mouth I'm I'm going to use I'm going to I'm going to give you power
14:03
and give you words just trust me so God spoke that to me so I said yes Lord because I just want to be in your will I
14:08
don't know how this is going to work I don't know how I cannot picture myself preach even one sermon I cannot pre
14:14
picture myself before 10 people because even in college I would do presentations in front of 10 people and I would go
14:21
like brain dead I I couldn't even remember what I was supposed to speak on because I couldn't handle public
14:27
speaking speaking off the cuff I could ask I could have a script I could sing with no nerves but speaking off the cuff
14:33
in front of people they're looking at me you know no so I couldn't picture how it was
14:38
going to take place I literally could not picture it was just I just stepped off the deep end and trusted God I Trust
14:45
You Lord so that's how it happened and as quickly as time went on God revealed
14:51
to me that well the god revealed to uh my spiritual father that I was to be
14:58
that I was called to be his spiritual daughter and once again it was like I I
15:03
know this I knew this was God there was no question and that how these
15:09
prophecies were going to take place is for me to come under this covering to be
15:15
a spiritual daughter of him and to receive impartation and
15:21
equipping of how to walk in the anointing and to be Christlike it would
15:26
come from being under him amen we learned about how this how the
15:33
impartation happens is as you plant yourself under a spiritual father or
15:39
mother whom God is calling you to be planted under and there's a scripture in the Psalms that we read last week how it
15:45
is like oil that is on the head of Aaron and it flows down his beard and down to
15:51
the rest of the body onto the edges of his robe and that's a picture of how impartation Works God anoints Aaron for
15:57
example God anoints a leader of a church he anoints a servant of God and this is
16:03
this is going to be for a Ministry of a church to have a church and to fulfill
16:09
God's assignment through this ministry through this church and then God will call people to come under and serve the
16:15
servant of God to fulfill this assignment and vision and so they come position themselves under and as they
16:21
position themselves under and serve the anointing oil just naturally comes down
16:27
and falls upon them as they get themselves in line This is the first principle of how to receive
16:35
impartation after having a pure heart which we've been learning about the other weeks having a pure surrendered
16:41
humble childlike heart that God can trust but then comes putting that in action and also following God's
16:48
principles and so these principles are are part of putting that heart into
16:54
action not just oh you have a precious heart but let's test the heart let's see
16:59
that heart in action right so one of those principles
17:04
is to be planted so I planted myself there and it
17:11
this is what we find in the Bible the this is this principle of of planting
17:17
yourself of of receiving impartation we see it through the story of Elijah to Elisha the story of elij of Elijah and
17:25
Elisha is the greatest example we have in the Bible of how to receive impartation of
17:33
anointing of God's system of receiving impartation so we're going to go right
17:38
now to First Kings 19:
17:47
19 so Prophet Elijah he he went from there and found
17:56
Elisha he was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen and he himself was driving the 12th
18:01
pair Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him Elisha then left his
18:07
oxen and ran after Elijah let me kiss my father and mother goodbye he said and
18:13
then I will come with you go back Elijah replied what have I done to you so
18:19
Elisha left him and went back he took his yolk of oxen and slaughtered them he burned the plowing equipment to cook the
18:24
meat and gave it to the people and they ate then he set out to follow follow Elijah and become his
18:34
servant so Elijah heard from
18:40
God this is this man Elisha I want him to be your
18:47
servant and I have this plan for him to receive your mantle and carry out the
18:54
work that I've started in you to finish it to keep going with
19:01
it that's what happened God spoke to Elijah I need you to raise up train up
19:08
and impart to another because God's work cannot be
19:15
limited to one person he needs a whole Army we are
19:20
amen and we are and also our time is limited on this Earth so it is not God's
19:27
way to just focus on yourself and your own Ministry and not be pouring into others
19:34
and not paying attention to who God wants you to pour into and raise up and
19:40
impart to and freely give what you have freely received that's God's way so God
19:46
spoke to Elijah this guy over here Elisha I'm calling him to be your
19:54
servant I'm calling him to be your spiritual son you go tell
19:59
him and that's what happened God spoke through
20:04
Elijah come follow me be my servant and Elisha knew it was God speaking we know
20:12
this because he just quickly he left everything and he just quickly followed and became his servant so this shows us
20:20
he heard from God he didn't confer with millions of people he heard from God and God was
20:27
saying now now I'm speaking now obey me and so
20:34
that's what happened amen and that's what happened with me
20:39
that's what happened with me I became his spiritual daughter and I received
20:45
anointing immediately as soon as I as as soon as I positioned myself the anointing under him the anointing
20:52
started to pour into him pour into me and then nine months after that God
20:59
called me to start fivefold church it was a different name at the time but God
21:05
called me to start fivefold church and um for four so I started at n nine
21:12
months later and the first about nine months or
21:18
so I would preach and I would pray for people but I was not it did not look
21:24
like it does today I was not seeing demons manifest I was not hearing
21:32
testimonies of healing of freedom for those first nine months I
21:38
wasn't seeing any manifestation of God's power I would pray for people one-on-one
21:43
we had 20 people or 15 people that first nine months and some and I think one
21:49
time I saw someone tear up but I didn't that could have just been emotions I didn't see any manifestation
21:56
of the power of God but I knew I had begun to receive anointing I knew and
22:03
even um the the fact that I was even able to
22:08
preach was a testimony that the anointing had begun to move and work
22:14
through me amen so I received it it was small kind of like when you become pregnant no one can see but everything
22:22
has just changed there's something living inside of you there was anointing living inside
22:27
of me but it comes little by little God tests you with what he gives you before he can trust you with more and he was
22:34
testing my faithfulness my um my faithfulness to
22:39
him and my faithfulness to his system of you know trusting my spiritual father as
22:45
well amen so then after those nine months I God was calling me to go visit
22:53
my spiritual father's Church in Tanzania East Africa and I had been a few times
22:58
before but a couple times before but God was calling me to go there specifically and receive a new level of impartation
23:06
you can receive impartation through online but many times especially if when it comes to uh a bigger level for God's
23:16
specific purpose God will call you to come make a sacrifice and come in person
23:23
to receive impartation so I went there I went full
23:28
of expectation and hungry to see what I saw at his church happen in LA and in
23:36
our church and in America because I had never seen anointing the power of God in
23:42
this level anywhere in America and I hungered for that more than anything so I went there hungry and
23:49
expectant and full of faith and he released impartation to me at that point
23:55
he poured oil upon my head and I felt back with the power of God and I
24:00
received impartation a couple days later I headed to the airport and his spiritual Sons
24:07
and Daughters an apostle and a prophet who walk in the power of God who cast out demons who heal the sick um walk in
24:14
that same anointing they drove me to the airport and they were so excited they were like it'll be so different from now
24:21
you will see God's power move with ease it it's going to be completely different
24:26
and I was like really wow and I believe them because
24:31
they've gone through it they they they're spiritual sons and daughters and they they're walk there I've seen them walk in the power of God now so then I'm
24:39
on the plane and I was so different in the spiritual realm I remember it was a 23-hour flight and usually I'm watching
24:46
movies nothing wrong with watching movies as long as they're not demonic and open up doors to the
24:52
devil but then we have a problem but nothing wrong with watching movies I would usually watch movies but but my my
24:59
spirit man was just lit on fire I mean I I could not do anything but read the
25:06
word and pray the whole 23-hour flight I mean I was just so on fire and and and
25:12
hungry and in love with Jesus and I was reading the word and the Bible was coming alive like never before I was
25:19
shocked I had never you know had my eyes open up as I read the word like that so
25:24
I already saw the the impact of the impartation upon me then so then it
25:30
comes to having Sunday service that the first Sunday we're back and I am so expected I am so hungry for God's power
25:36
to move in the church we had about 15 something people at that time and Jean
25:42
tall's M wasn't there yet but her mom came I think it was like the second time
25:48
I think that she came her mom and her dad and at the end of the service I mean sorry at the end of the preaching the
25:54
sermon I said come forward everyone and there was just like 15 people in the church at that time and she was I she
26:03
was standing right here I placed my hand gently on her hand and all of a sudden
26:08
she fell back with God's power and I was shocked
26:15
be be I was shocked because I had never seen God's power move through me ever
26:21
before that moment and right after that all of a sudden the prophetic anointing Came Upon
26:28
me like what happened was I started now I never like I I remember my spiritual
26:34
father he's a prophet and so I'm receiving this prophetic anointing I remember him prophesying about how I would see so much in the spiritual realm
26:41
and everything and I was like wow this is going to be amazing cuz
26:46
like I've never seen anything I've never seen any kind of really Vision I've never heard anything for anybody I was
26:54
so amazed when I see people operating the prophetic I've never had see you know had any prophetic
27:00
inkling but I believed I believed what the prophet spoke what God was speaking
27:05
through the prophet and so all of a sudden I start praying for someone and a knowing comes in my spirit just a
27:13
knowing and I mean a knowing about like for her to of what to pray for her and so I started speaking just words I think
27:20
it was something like you've been hurt by a lot of people but God is freeing you from this pain now and God is
27:25
bringing good people in your life something like that and I didn't know her and as I'm speaking this she's
27:31
crying so much and it was then that I realized wow the prophetic anointings
27:37
come upon me I really received impartation
27:42
Hallelujah and then I went and prayed for another person and this the same
27:47
thing happened they this knowing Came Upon me I said these words and was making them cry and then another person
27:54
I prayed for them and afterwards they they told me that they like saw this Vision they saw fire on their hands like
27:59
everyone's having all these powerful encounters and that was the first time I saw any kind of manifestation of the
28:05
power of God moved through me it was right after receiving that new level of impartation from my spiritual father and
28:13
so then for the next for the next like three-ish years about three years um it
28:20
looked just like that it was every service sometimes people would fall down with the power of God and have
28:25
encounters with Jesus I mean we were small so it wasn't every single service but most Services there would be some
28:32
encounter with God God's power moving it was through prophetic Ministry many times um people would just be touched by
28:38
prophetic word um people would be baptized in the Holy Spirit and it was
28:44
that for three years no healing or Deliverance maybe a couple testimonies of healings but no
28:51
Deliverance okay so that was for three years it was like the same and God God
28:57
was testing me through that you know being to see if I'd be grateful for his precious anointing even though it wasn't
29:05
you know the mighty Revival anointing that we're going to see someday but for
29:10
three years it was just that and we actually got smaller each year so God really was testing if I would be
29:17
faithful to God and also be faithful to his principle of being planted of trusting also my spiritual father and
29:24
those prophetic words that he spoke you know amen and so um and so then I continued
29:33
to receive impartation the anointing was growing in me all throughout that time as I continued to be obedient and keep
29:40
serving God and following his principles that I'm going to teach even more to you today what those principles are the
29:47
anointing continued to grow in me now for me uh you know how God really began
29:53
to unlock the anointing how how it happened for me was is is very much kind
29:59
of like a baby being born like the anointing was growing in me but we
30:05
weren't seeing like this gradual growth like I said it was pretty much the same for three years and our church was
30:12
getting smaller and smaller each year down to two people the year 2020 that
30:18
third year going to the fourth year and then
30:24
what happened was the walls of Jericho came down as God had promised
30:30
me Hallelujah my uh spiritual father he had
30:35
also prophesied that he prophesied this like I think a year and a halfish after
30:41
I started the church something like that he prophesied that the way that these prophecies were going to come to pass
30:47
the way that Revival was going to break out this prophecy of Revival is now and explain across the whole world and the
30:53
way that these promises for my life would come to pass as well of of seeing God's power move through me um the way
31:01
that that Revival was going to break out was was going to be he said I see it happening through one minute
31:07
videos so God is saying right now you need to put out one minute videos
31:13
consistently continually just like the Israelites walked around the walls of Jericho they were just obedient they
31:18
just kept going they kept going even though there's not a brick after a brick falling down no sign that it's going to come down they feel kind of silly but
31:24
they just keep being obedient to what God Said and then after they had gone around those seven
31:31
times seven days the walls came down God made the walls to come
31:38
down and so then I taught myself how to edit I didn't know how to edit and we we
31:44
had like five I mean five to 10 people at the church at that time nobody knew how to edit and nobody had the time to
31:50
serve so it was mostly me um doing everything and so I taught myself how to edit I started putting out videos they
31:58
got hardly any views or interactions for 3 years until um I put I one my
32:05
millionth video out now I don't know how many but probably I don't know how many but tons of videos I put out and and
32:12
finally 20120 uh the last day of 2020 I put out a Tik Tok video that was 59
32:18
seconds showing God moveing power that past year now it wasn't Deliverance there was one healing uh or a couple
32:25
healings that were there in that video and Jean tall's in it falling back with the power of God U but it was just a
32:32
montage of God moving in power and I say a simple prayer at the end declaring freedom and healing for people and it
32:37
and in a day and a half on my 30th birthday January 1st 2021 it went viral it hit 1 million views and the greater
32:45
Miracle is that there were thousands of comments testifying of Miracles people received through that video people
32:51
saying I my pain left Co left me it was the times where Co was it was 2020
32:57
the first day um uh I I I I felt something leave me and now I feel peace
33:03
all sorts of Miracles atheist saying I uh I'm an atheist but I felt power when
33:09
I watched that and so the walls of Jericho came down and then I started
33:15
going live twice a week from there and miracles were happening on every live and there was immediately a big
33:20
following because of the viral video people followed so much because of that one viral video and then more videos
33:27
were going viral Miracles were happening on every live and I was shocked because
33:32
only one time had I seen God do a miracle through me going live and that was two months prior but now it was
33:39
every time two months later March 21st I'm in the park where we were where
33:46
I was ministering because it was covid time so we went outside and this woman
33:51
travels from Massachusetts with her friend and two others travel from n Nashville just to be at our church
33:57
service on the park because they had seen these videos that went viral and they felt God pulling them to come and
34:02
encounter him there and so that day I prayed for her like I prayed for the
34:08
past several a few years now but this time something completely different happened God unlocked the anointing that
34:15
was growing in me like never before where as I started to pray for her she
34:21
fell back with the power of God she started convulsing and I realized then this these are demons man esting in her
34:28
so I commanded the demons to go because God his grace was there to help me and
34:34
give me strength to do this for the first time and I commanded the demon to go and the demon left her with such
34:40
Force she fell down um and was just and fell asleep and she was set free
34:46
[Music] hallelujah hallelujah and from there it was just so
34:54
much like my spiritual father how one day Day Jesus appeared to him released the anointing to him gave him the keys
35:01
and from there the power of God was moving every time that's what happened ever since that day the power of God
35:08
just continued to move and set people free and do kind new kinds of Miracles
35:13
we hadn't really heard much about before like heal many people from autism heal people from many things
35:20
and almost immediately testimonies of people receiving impartation started to come in
35:27
and I've just been so in awe of all that God has done it's just increased since there mightily where now the whole world
35:34
is hungry for God's power and H and are receiving his miracles and in person God
35:40
has opened up doors for me to go to several Nations I lost I don't know even the number so many nations glory to God
35:46
the past two years and so many nations traveling here to be here and encounter
35:52
Jesus every time God is so good he's so faithful amen
35:57
but that's my story and I mean
36:02
I I am not walking in the power of God just on my own I am not walking in the
36:09
power of God because it was just me and Jesus and Jesus giving me everything and
36:14
teaching me everything just him I'm here because of my spiritual father who I've received impartation
36:21
from and I've received equipping from I have never seen
36:28
I'd never seen the manifestation of Jesus through a person like I had through my spiritual father in terms of
36:35
character in terms of his heart in terms of his humility servanthood generosity um surrender and love for
36:43
people never have I seen it like I've seen it in him and I have never seen the power of God manifested like how we see
36:50
in the Bible through the apostles and the Bible in the acts church I've never seen it like I've seen it through him
36:57
I never see demons flee like I've seen through him and miracles happen as I've seen through
37:02
him and so I give him honor and I I want to be just so honest with you that this
37:12
is the truth and this is how it has happened to give honor where honor is
37:17
due as the Bible says and also to teach you because these are principles
37:23
biblical principles from Elijah to Elisha how the anointed came that that
37:28
this is God's way of how to receive impartation and walk in his anointing
37:35
number one to be planted where God has called you to be planted to hear in the
37:41
spirit God saying I'm calling you to go here this is your Elijah leave
37:46
everything and serve
37:52
Elijah follow Elijah as he follows me as Paul says follow follow me as I follow
37:58
Christ I want you to assist and help with the work of God here plant yourself
38:05
here amen don't go anywhere else I've called you
38:11
here and I I'll be honest with you I know for sure that if I had not been
38:18
obedient to to this that God has called me to to be planted under my spiritual
38:24
father I would not be here today we would not be here today the Miracles you
38:29
received would not happen to would have not happened I would not be walking in the anointing we don't get to
38:36
choose our Elijah we don't get to choose how we
38:42
want to receive impartation we don't get to go I want to find the most popular non-controversial
38:54
Minister and I got to like his or her personality too yeah and so then I'm going to insert
39:03
myself there I'm going to try to make connections there because I'm trying to
39:09
receive impartation for myself and I'm going to do it my
39:15
way a lot of people this is what they think and this is how they
39:21
act it does not work that way it cannot work that
39:27
way and so I know for sure that I I am
39:33
here today walking in my calling and walking in the anointing because I was obedient to where God has C where God
39:39
had called me to be planted underneath the spiritual father he had called me to be planted
39:46
underneath God had placed specific anointing in him just like he did with
39:51
Elijah God wanted Elisha to carry Elijah's exact mantle God was calling
39:57
Elisha to the same calling as
40:03
Elijah the the mantle that Elisha receiv received the meaning of mantle is it's the same anointing there are different
40:11
anointings it was the same uh anointing that Elijah was
40:16
walking in that Elisha received that's why Elisha had to be obedient to go to where Elijah was and
40:24
serve him because you can't choose your calling you can't choose your
40:29
purpose only God chooses it and so that's how it was for me my
40:37
spiritual father had the anointing that God wanted to release to me the mantle God wanted to release to
40:44
me the same assignment and vision to release Revival to to cast out
40:51
demons to free the oppressed to heal the sick to to
40:56
accept and embrace God's five-fold Ministry everything that we see in the acts church
41:03
amen and so God called me there and um I know this principle I
41:10
know this principle to be true and we see we see how Elisha was
41:17
tested in this principle of staying planted staying put and not going other
41:23
places in second in uh 2 Kings chapter 2:2 Elijah said to Elisha Elijah said to
41:30
Elisha stay here the Lord has sent me to bethl but Elisha said as surely as the Lord lives and as you live I will not
41:36
leave you so they went down to bethl um I'm going to fast forward a
41:42
couple of scriptures Elijah said to him stay here Master uh uh then Elijah said
41:47
to him stay here Elisha the Lord has sent me to Jericho and he replied as surely as the Lord lives and as you live
41:54
I will not leave you so so they went out to Jericho the company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked
42:00
him do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today yes I know he replied so be quiet then Elijah
42:05
said to him stay here the Lord has sent me to the Jordan and he replied as surely as the Lord lives and as you live
42:11
I will not leave you so the two of them walked
42:16
on so several times Elijah is saying Elisha stay here while I go over here
42:23
and Elisha kept saying no I won't leave you and this was a test from God a test of
42:30
his loyalty a test to see if he would remain planted where God had called him to and Elisha passed it this was a test
42:37
he needed to pass to receive his mantle the mantle from Elijah and I've been tested in this too
42:44
um you know the American Church the American western church I'm just going
42:50
to be real there's a lot of religion in yeah it's no secret there's a lot of of religion y'all know I preach
42:58
I preach about a lot too we did that whole religion month historian religion
43:04
teaching here series here but there's a lot of religion in the American church
43:11
and the western church not just American and there's um there's
43:17
ethnocentrism in America in general and also in the American Church um there's also racism it's real
43:27
it's in America in American church as well and um there's many with just biases too and it's just uh shaped a
43:36
view wrong not a spiritual view that people have of others and so I've seen all of that um I've seen all of those
43:45
things make some people reject my spiritual father and in turn reject
43:52
me because he's my spiritual father um um I've seen that and I've seen the
43:59
temptation of the enemy you know um this is the thing about religion is
44:05
that the the more that someone is like Jesus the more religion hates
44:14
them it's just what we see in the Bible with Jesus Jesus himself there's no one that religion
44:21
hated more than Jesus there's nobody the Pharisees the Sadducees the religious
44:28
ones hated more than Jesus the hatred was so strong that they crucified Jesus
44:34
they put him on a cross because of the hatred because of the jealousy so today the more that we are
44:41
like Jesus the Pharisees of today the religious spirit the more they will hate
44:49
us so I've seen that hatred I've seen that jealousy spirit that Pharisee
44:54
religious spirit um reject my spiritual father and so I've seen a lot of people um uh uh the devil try to use a
45:02
lot of people to tempt me to leave my spiritual father I I I've I've heard many people have said you should leave
45:10
him here I can mentor you over here
45:16
instead and you know what I say to that to all
45:22
those people who say that to me who have said that to me in the past and who will
45:28
say it to me in the future I say these familiar words that Jesus said one time
45:33
to a to a Christian oh you already know get behind me
45:39
[Applause] [Laughter]
45:48
Satan Hallelujah Jesus literally Jesus
45:54
literally said that to Peter you know so I'm not I'm I'm not afraid of
46:00
offending anybody I'm going be like Jesus I'mma say the truth Matthew 16:21 from that time on
46:08
Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders
46:13
the chief priests and the teachers of the law and that he M must be killed and on the third day be raised to life Peter
46:19
took him aside and began to rebuke him never Lord he said this shall never happen to you Jesus turned and said to Peter get be behind me Satan you are a
46:28
stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the concerns of
46:33
God but merely human concerns yeah so a lot of Christians can
46:40
literally be agents of Satan it's not like Peter was possessed by Satan but in that moment he was being
46:49
used that's why Jesus said this is the devil talking to me and trying to tempt me right now get behind me I reject that
47:06
lie yeah and so I'm never leaving my spiritual
47:12
father I I could never I know that this would grieve God more than anything and
47:17
would that's what would grieve my heart more than anything I know that the anointing would dry up I know that my
47:22
purpose would not be fulfilled I know that the devil's plans would
47:28
succeed I'm not going to let that happen so I'm going to say get behind me Satan and continue to speak
47:36
that I know this is God's principle you cannot choose whoever you want to choose
47:42
when God calls you to your Elijah you need to stay with your Elijah you can't make it work other places less
47:49
controversial places where you're going to be more accepted it's not going to work the
47:56
anointing won't pour in your life you might be fooling yourself you might open a door and let the devil give you powers
48:02
and you think you're walking in the anointing but you're not don't play around with that do not
48:11
play around with God's principle of receiving anointing we need to have reverence in this area don't mess around
48:17
and try to receive anointing however you want amen
48:24
hallelujah
48:30
so this is the first principle of receiving impartation is being planted stain
48:36
put Matthew 16 uh I'm sorry the second um the second principle of receiving the
48:43
anointing is to serve to be a true servant remember Elisha then became a
48:50
servant of Elijah and so the second principle is to serve where you are planed Ed to be a servant there and to
48:58
have a servant heart there a lot of people that want to receive anointing
49:05
they want to receive impartation a lot of Christians this is their heart I love
49:12
God I want to help people I want God to use me to help
49:17
people and I also want to be powerful and successful and look
49:24
impressive it's a lot of people because a lot of
49:29
people they have flesh there still and so to be truth that's to be truthful that's a lot of people's hearts
49:36
I'm not saying they don't love God I'm not saying they don't want to help people but they also got this wrong
49:42
motive there at the same time you cannot have that wrong motive there it's going
49:48
to poison and spoil everything spoil your heart your whole heart it's going to dirty your whole
49:53
heart right and so the principle of receiving anointing like okay what I'm teaching about of how
49:59
to receive impartation this is all about God seeing that he can trust you so it's not like do this step and
50:07
this step and this step and you'll receive the anointing no like do this step but have your heart there not just
50:14
doing it like doing a checklist but have your heart there like
50:19
really do what God's instructing you plant yourself and really plant yourself don't just show up up to church on
50:26
Sundays don't just put the lives on and not really be paying attention but be a true
50:33
disciple be a true disciple as you're listen with your whole ears get here early don't leave early stay the whole
50:40
time listen to the message again meditate on the word take notes listen to it a second time take notes and be
50:47
meditating on it and putting it into practice the the teaching on Sundays throughout the whole week come to the lives in the middle of
50:55
the week and be a disciple again apply it meditate it on it again as much
51:01
teaching and equipping is coming forth to you where you're planted be a disciple always there take it seriously
51:07
that's one of the big principles of being planted a big part of being planted be a real disciple okay
51:15
so you have to have a servant heart and you H you can't just so you can't just
51:21
be serving and helping and assisting at the church but you have to have a servant
51:30
heart a servant heart this kind of heart god is looking for the one he will
51:36
anoint is the one that is passionate about God's
51:44
work that is not passionate about themselves that is not passionate about them being anointed and having a
51:50
Ministry but is passionate about God's work is passionate about people being
51:56
saved healed delivered their eyes open up to God's love being equipped and
52:02
being powerful vessels of God God's looking for that
52:08
heart I shared with you that my biggest passion became to see other people
52:14
encounter God's power and so I remember um when I first you know started seeing
52:20
God move in power I would invite people like crazy to where I was encountering God's
52:26
power to the places I was encountering God's power um and then when I met my
52:33
spiritual father and I received my calling I believed that God was calling me to walk in the anointing like my
52:39
spiritual father was but I didn't feel it and it felt like it was far away and it was so hard for me to picture
52:46
it um but something really beautiful and healthy happened in that time of not
52:52
feeling that I love that God called me in this place of like such weakness and that I
52:58
didn't see myself uh of what God has called me to because it humbled me it kept me
53:05
humble it wasn't like I had I should be anointed I would be a great
53:11
Minister and then I received this prophecy yes about
53:18
time no looking back I'm like so happy because I know how important it is that
53:23
we are humble and so happy that I didn't see myself to what of what God has
53:29
called me to what happened was I just obeyed okay Lord and for like three and
53:36
a half years I'm not seeing Mighty anointing work through me so I still really wasn't seeing myself who God
53:41
called me to be but in the first in the beginning um I was just so I was just so
53:50
amazed how my life had transformed ever since I encountered God's love and power
53:56
through my spiritual father I had never known the love of Jesus like I began to
54:02
know as my eyes opened up through God moving through my spiritual father um I I I I began to have my eyes
54:10
open in the spiritual realm to uh the reality of the spiritual realm like never before through my spiritual father
54:18
God moving through my spiritual father I saw Mass Deliverance take place for the first time through my spiritual father
54:24
and that day was changed forever I I my eyes opening up to see how real the
54:29
devil is and how evil he is and and then at the same time my eyes SE seen how
54:35
people are the way they are because the devil's so real in their lives and that
54:41
people they they don't want to be this way most of the time but they're just oppressed that made me have love for
54:47
people like never before from that day and so I just felt so grateful like
54:52
I had been transformed more into the image of God than ever before in my life because of God moving through my
54:59
spiritual father and and I and I had seen God's power move through him and touch so many
55:04
people and so I just wanted I just wanted more people to know his ministry
55:11
I wanted more people to encounter God through him because my life had been changed and so I had this heart of being
55:18
passionate about God's kingdom his work I had this heart of Simply being passionate about how ever God was
55:26
moving it was just this simple passion um and and so my heart burned
55:33
for that my heart burned for God to lift him for God's glory my heart burned for
55:38
people to accept him for God's glory my heart burned for people in America to accept him because I know that there the
55:43
religion the different culture in Africa and all of that it's hard for people in religion to
55:50
accept him you know and because of his culture and where he's from and God moving him in such a powerful way that
55:58
people haven't seen before and so much like Jesus that religion hates it my heart burned for this because I had
56:04
never seen God's power move like this before and so I wasn't thinking about myself at all I wasn't like oh they
56:11
probably won't accept you but they'll accept me so give me more anointing so we can get
56:18
this going so people can receive God's power in America or that wasn't my heart
56:24
my heart was simply I want people to encounter God's power and I've
56:30
encountered God's power like never before through you so I hope I pray that
56:35
God lifts you for his glory for doors open for you so more people can so people can encounter what I've
56:41
encountered Jesus the real Jesus that was my heart
56:47
and as I look back I see that that is the servant heart that God is looking
56:52
for the servant heart where you are so honoring and grateful for where you have
57:01
received the the what how you have received God's power that you want to assist and serve and and do anything you
57:09
can to help this work of God go forth more not thinking about
57:15
yourself so many people they they don't have this servant heart and they see anointed people and they're
57:22
like how did she or he get that
57:27
anointing I want that anointing I want that how did they get
57:35
that this is it's the truth there's a lot of Christians like
57:41
this jealousy and just no servant heart not
57:46
having that heart of wow God's using you to bring Salvation
57:53
healing and freedom to people praise
58:00
[Applause] God the I prayed for this I prayed for
58:05
this for God to raise up more people in the power of God like we see in the acts church it's happening it looks like
58:13
revivals now God's raised this person up Hallelujah I'm going to spread the word
58:20
Revival is happening I'm going to spread the word to these so many people that I know the people that are under me that
58:26
they need Freedom need healing go receive it there go under Apostle Peter's Shadow there
58:33
receive it's rare the sad truth that is that is rare it is rare to have that
58:39
true servant heart where your single passion is for Jesus and his
58:45
work Jesus and his work to be done Jesus and the Salvation healing and freedom of
58:51
people it's it's kind of it's pretty rare it's pretty rare to have that selfish
58:58
motivation gone from you and that's a big reason why the anointing has been rare
59:05
today and that's a big reason why it's a cost to receive the anointing it's not given easily you have to get this
59:13
selfish motivation out of you the jealousy out of you this desire
59:20
of wanting to look powerful out of you and you have to have
59:25
this servant heart this passion for Jesus and his work his people to receive
59:31
him that passion alone God sees your heart you can't hide
59:36
it from him Hallelujah so looking back I see how I
59:44
was very much like Elisha to Elijah like Elisha was called to be a servant of
59:50
Elijah it doesn't say like Elisha you're going to receive Elijah's
59:56
Mantle you're are so amazing come and serve him but you're
1:00:02
being prepared to receive the mantle no it's just serve him God was
1:00:09
testing him serve him do you have a servant heart are you are you in it for something else are you
1:00:15
serving with a with a fake heart just so you can get the
1:00:21
mantle and when we see Elijah I mean it says in the Bible he was a servant of
1:00:27
Elijah so his whole life he's just serving serving Elijah serving Elijah serving Elijah and one day
1:00:36
surprise because this heart was so beautiful God tested it he could trust it the mantle of Elijah Came Upon
1:00:47
Elisha and even double portion so he was he was walking in the
1:00:52
same anointing doing the same Miracles as Elijah and
1:00:59
double hallelujah it wasn't overnight you got to be in it just to
1:01:08
serve not in it for anything else years pass you're just in it to serve God wants you to have this heart that I just
1:01:15
want to help the kingdom of God go forth so where he's planted you is where you've received from you've received
1:01:21
healing Freedom eyes open up to God's love salvation Abundant Life be
1:01:27
appreciative of there and have the passion for the work of God that you've received that's helping many others
1:01:32
there serve there do whatever is needed there to assist and help that work of
1:01:38
God Advance
1:01:45
more and when God sees that selflessness that it's been tested that servant heart has been tested then the anointing will
1:01:52
come upon you and then when when it comes upon you you will not be thinking about yourself and how you look but you
1:01:59
will have this same exact heart this passion for God's work and passion for
1:02:05
God's people people who are truly anointed they are not thinking about how
1:02:10
powerful and awesome they are and how great they look first of all they don't have time for that because your life is
1:02:18
a life of servanthood and sacrifice the more that you are called to the more
1:02:24
that is required the more anointing the more that's required of
1:02:30
you and so it's a life of constant sacrifice and servant Hood number one you don't have time to be thinking about
1:02:36
your own desires how you look all of that junk but number two when you when God
1:02:42
has really called someone to be anointed when they are truly anointed he will make sure they do not have that heart it
1:02:49
will not be in them their mind is completely on serving
1:02:54
God their mind is completely on loving his people and serving his people
1:03:01
amen
1:03:06
hallelujah Romans 1:1 says this letter is from Paul a slave of Christ Jesus
1:03:12
chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his good news so he he def
1:03:17
he says that I am a slave that's the heart of a true anointed person I've
1:03:22
laid aside all my desires and I've surrendered everything and I am a servant a slave of
1:03:30
Christ that's my life to do whatever he wants glamorous are not behind the
1:03:38
scenes or before people I am a slave I am a servant and it's all for God's
1:03:43
glory everything I do amen
1:03:48

1:04:28

1:04:56
of you watching online the biggest way to serve and this is for all of you here too even though a lot of you are here in
1:05:01
person and there's other ways you can serve like here in the church but a big way that God is calling all of you to
1:05:06
serve and every one of you who are planted online to serve is by spreading
1:05:12
the word sharing what God's doing sharing the videos this is how you were all here
1:05:19
this is how the Revival broke out is because somebody first of all it was me
1:05:25
putting the video out and then it's it's it's it's transformed in it's grown into
1:05:30
many people sharing videos posts and and some some of you it just
1:05:36
showed up on the algorithm the algorithm made it to just appear well it just appeared because other people were
1:05:42
sharing it and made the algorithm to go put it on your feed so you are all here and many of you here
1:05:50
have received Deliverance healing
1:05:56
salvation grown in the spirit because people have served with servant Hearts
1:06:03
they've served you and you don't even know it but they have served and served with servant Hearts many people in army
1:06:11
so join the Army so more people can be reached we are so small compared to the
1:06:16
whole world that needs to be reached right now here in La this is so tiny compared to all the people that God
1:06:23
wants to bring here and the way they will come here is by you serving by
1:06:29
Spreading the News sharing be unashamed share the videos and the posts regularly not just once in a while be obedient
1:06:37
have a servant heart go in it with a servant attitude not just when you feel like it not just when you have
1:06:42
time not just your favorite video no be be a servant have a servant heart and
1:06:50
share your own testimony too and keep sharing it record videos write it
1:06:55
continue to share testimonies your testimony amen hallelujah God sees
1:07:02
this as you serve the anointing comes upon
1:07:07
you it it it's it's not just the laying on hands or the Declaration that the
1:07:13
anointing comes but it's doing these principles that makes the oil flow to
1:07:18
you even just throughout your days you don't need to be like oh I need more
1:07:23
anointing I need Apostle Catherine to pright no the an the oil is just coming upon you as you are following these
1:07:28
principles with the right heart God sees and he
1:07:33
pours amen we see in John
1:07:38
12:3 Mary picked up an alabaster jar filled with nearly a liter of extremely
1:07:43
rare and costly perfume the purest extract of nard and she anointed Jesus's
1:07:49
feet then she wiped them dry with her long hair and the fragrance an of the
1:07:54
costly oil filled the house this is a prophetic
1:07:59
picture of how serving serving being a
1:08:06
servant in God's house in God's work serving the servant of God how that
1:08:12
releases the anointing to you Mary poured this extremely costly expensive
1:08:20
perfume upon Jesus's feet she was laying down frustrate that's a picture prophetic picture of
1:08:27
surrender and The Story Goes that one of the people there one of the disciples
1:08:32
thinks she's foolish wasting this expensive perfume on Jesus but Jesus
1:08:38
corrects him and says no I will tell about her everywhere the
1:08:46
gospel is preached she will be told about because what she has done is right and it is good so that's a picture of
1:08:52
sacrifice and sacrifice in every area of your life that's a picture of sacrifice
1:08:58
obedience sacrifice and serving your so that's your time that's your seeds and
1:09:04
that's your gifts you're giving to God you're sacrificing all giving to God
1:09:09
this expensive perfume and your surrendered Lane
1:09:14
prostrate and and and so she then took her hair and wiped wiped Jesus's feet
1:09:21
which had the perfume on it with her hair and as she left that place now
1:09:27
Jesus smelled like that perfume that was put on her that he that she put on him that she put on him
1:09:33
right and she left that place smelling just like
1:09:38
Jesus because she took the hair she s she surrendered served
1:09:43
sacrificed and she left that place smelling like the anointed one so you know Elisha received that
1:09:52
exact anointing from from Elijah so he was looking like Elijah for the glory of
1:09:57
God just like how Paul says follow me as I follow Jesus so it's a good thing for
1:10:03
his spiritual children to look like him to sound like him because he looks and sounds and acts
1:10:09
Christlike amen and so um and and and when where
1:10:15
God is calling you to specifically he he's doing something specific there a specific assignment and vision there for
1:10:23
example my my spiritual father he has great revelation of the anointing and authority of Christ and so he has great
1:10:30
Revelation that it is the power of God and our Authority that we have that makes demons go and miracles to take
1:10:38
place not physical effort not a loud voice so he ministers in Simplicity he
1:10:45
ministers without screaming loud he ministers without having to use physical
1:10:50
Force he speaks simply and demons go quickly I Minister the same
1:10:58
way amen because I I do look like him and
1:11:04
sound like him that's what God wants this Revelation is what God is bringing
1:11:09
to the body of Christ right now this revelation of the power of His
1:11:15
anointing the power of the authority we have and the revelation of truly what
1:11:22
makes demons go and what destroys the kingdom of darkness that's what God is
1:11:28
bringing now that's it's revelation of what we see in the acts church that's been lost he's restoring now amen so so
1:11:36
you should be uh looking sounding acting like your spiritual father or mother
1:11:43
spiritually wise amen which is going to be Christlike and so that same anointing
1:11:50
that your spiritual father or mother is walking in you're going to leave this place walking
1:11:56
in that same anointing smelling like Jesus
1:12:01
amen
1:12:06
hallelujah the last principle I'm going to share with you um these These are
1:12:11
three principles by the way of how to receive impartation with the right heart and as you follow these with the
1:12:18
right heart the anointing will automatically come upon you whether I lay a hand or not God sees it all and he
1:12:28
will release that anointing so when I declare may this anointing come upon you mighty anointing will come with that
1:12:33
word to specifically you God's pouring out different measures upon everyone based on your specific calling based on
1:12:40
his timing and based on your heart and obedience are you following these principles not leaving out one of the
1:12:46
principles but following them all these principles are the same principles of what being planted means
1:12:53
by the way the third principle is to sew into the
1:12:59
anointing the Bible says what you sow you will
1:13:04
reap as you sow into this anointed ground this is already God's calling by
1:13:10
the way for us to bring tithe bring offering to the work of God this is already just God's calling
1:13:17
it's already an act of obedience to give to sow but God wants your eyes to open
1:13:23
up for you to have Revelation that you are not just doing this just out of obedience and it's like nothing's taking
1:13:28
place other than God's pleased but there's even more this is a way of
1:13:34
reaping this is a way of receiving more anointing some people are missing out on
1:13:41
receiving more that God wants for them and I'm talking about uh in every aspect that the anointing covers healing
1:13:47
Freedom breakthrough Financial breakthrough but also impartation many
1:13:53
are missing out because they're missing this principle many are missing out because they're blinded by religion and
1:14:00
refuse to accept this principle of the power of sewing the Bible is clear that what you seow you will reap as you bring
1:14:06
the seeds to the anointed ground you will reap more of that anointing in your life more of anointing of
1:14:13
impartation Amen it says in uh Proverbs
1:14:21
11:24 one gives freely yet grow all the Richer another withholds what he should give and only suffers want whoever
1:14:28
brings blessing will be enriched and one who Waters will himself be
1:14:35
watered it's very important that you are honoring the anointing you're
1:14:43
receiving in multiple ways including sewing bringing
1:14:50
sacrifice you want to water what's watering you God needs to see you're valuing it
1:14:57
so we can continue to pour it upon you and increase what he's pouring upon
1:15:04
you and what many people don't know today in the body of Christ because we
1:15:10
have not seen the ACT church as it should be we have not seen how powerful the church is when it's how God intended
1:15:16
it to be we have not the church is not doing much without the
1:15:22
anointing so it doesn't have much value without
1:15:27
it so what many people don't realize because of this in these times without
1:15:34
the anointing what many people don't realize is that listen God releases the
1:15:40
anointing to the head the head is the Le the servant of God who God calls to have
1:15:46
a Ministry Church the anointing is released there
1:15:51
the anointing is not released here here there everywhere it's released To The Head and the head represents the
1:15:58
ministry it's the leader of the ministry and the ministry flows from the head from Jesus to the Head the
1:16:05
ministry and then the anointing fls from the head to the rest of the body so this is God's real system of how
1:16:13
how it should work the anointing is poured upon the servant of God this he calls the servant of God to have a
1:16:19
Ministry a church the church is the place where the body of Christ is equipped and receives impartation to
1:16:25
reach the rest of the world so all of you come here you
1:16:31
receive from the head anointing you receive impartation and you receive equipping of how to walk in the in the
1:16:39
anointing how to be more Christlike and how to see in the spiritual realm to have victory over the
1:16:45
devil and then you go into the world you go from here and go out into the world
1:16:52
you go into your workplace some of you some people have other Ministries and they receive impartation and they're planted here because you if if you have
1:16:59
your other Ministry and God's called you to receive impartation here you need to follow all the principles it's not just
1:17:04
like I'm going to come and get this and then go if you want to see it keep pouring into your life it's the same
1:17:09
principles and you need to be honest of where you're receiving the anointing too because we can't hide we can't we
1:17:17
have to honor the anointing you can't receive anointing you don't honor amen you can't be secretive about
1:17:24
it oh it's just all me and Jesus alone no it it will dry up but but you receive the anointing
1:17:33
here you receive the equipping you go out into the world you go some of some of it's to your own Ministry some of you have your own
1:17:39
churches and you release there what you've received here you go into your workplace you go
1:17:46
into your family you go into the marketplace you go into the business you go to on the street you go all different
1:17:52
places and and encounter people in the world and you release what you have received from the
1:17:58
head you you release the anointing you release the word of God you've
1:18:04
received but you you have to understand this is God's order and principle it's not just God told me this you there was
1:18:12
order God told you through a servant of God God told you through the head just
1:18:19
like God told me my purpose through my spiritual father God released the
1:18:25
anointing upon my life through my spiritual father right and so guess what I honor
1:18:32
my spiritual father because I know this was God's system of releasing the anointing and equipping to me and
1:18:38
fulfilling my purpose I couldn't choose another way this is God's way alone for
1:18:44
my life and so I have to honor him and I have to honor in every
1:18:51
way you know I have have to water there to continue to be
1:18:57
watered amen I have to recognize it has come from God through him to me I can't
1:19:06
bypass him God chose to come through him so I will choose to honor
1:19:14
him amen so many people have such a problem
1:19:21
with giving to the church church because they're missing this Revelation that I just shared you're not receiving it just
1:19:27
from anywhere you're receiving it from one place when it's really God's way and how you're able to help other
1:19:33
people and release anointing to other people and cast demons out of other people and speak the word of God to
1:19:39
other people has happened because you received equipping and impartation from the place you're
1:19:44
planted from so that's why it's you you should honor in every way including through the
1:19:52
seed it's this it's this principle of in life when you're are grateful to somebody for
1:19:57
what they have given you you honor you give Thanksgiving not just with words
1:20:02
but you feel in your heart you some people maybe it's like a Christmas present or something I don't know you're
1:20:07
thinking about it for months I want to give them the most amazing gift or amazing birthday gift right like the
1:20:13
more someone touches you and blesses you the more you want to honor and give thanks right so it's the same principle
1:20:21
God wants to see that he wants to see that you really value he he measures that if you're
1:20:27
valuing what you receive from you're valuing his kingdom you're valuing his
1:20:32
work because that's his way of doing his work is releasing from the head and then
1:20:38
it disperses everywhere else amen so so that's why it's important to
1:20:45
sew and to sew with the gender ofous heart and to continue to sew so it it it
1:20:51
connects you to the anointing so continues to pour upon you and increases upon you as well amen amen
1:21:01
hallelujah thank you Jesus
