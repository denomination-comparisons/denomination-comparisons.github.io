I've been doing a series on my book The Secret of the anointing where I've been expanding more on the book um and so if
0:08
you have not gotten the book absolutely make sure you get it because I'm expanding upon it I taught a message
0:17
about the heart that God searches for I expanded on uh one of the things I
0:25
write about in chapter three which is the cost of the anointing
0:31
and I I taught on that it's it's important to know the heart that God is really looking for the heart he's
0:38
looking for to anoint that he can trust and so if you did not see that
0:46
message uh go back on the YouTube after this after this week after this Sunday
0:53
and watch that it's on our YouTube you can find it there uh it's very important
0:58
you you get that and then also on this past Wednesday I went live and I taught
1:05
I expanded even more on Sunday's message so if you haven't seen Wednesdays definitely check it out to there I
1:12
talked about the death of ego and how important that is to have a
1:20
heart that God can trust and God can use he can pour His anointing out on so
1:27
today uh this message is called the cost of
1:33
sacrificial love Hallelujah and so the we read last
1:41
week about the the greatest Commandments the greatest commandment is to love the Lord
1:47
your God with all your heart all all your soul all your mind and the second
1:53
is is just as important is to love your neighbor as
1:58
yourself love your neighbor as
2:04
yourself so a lot of people don't really know what that commandment means love
2:10
your neighbor as yourself a lot of people like to just take love your neighbor love your neighbor as you want
2:18
at your pace when it's comfortable choose which kind of neighbor you want
2:23
to love and removing the as yourself
2:29
important an part of the scripture first of all I'm the the in
2:35
chapter 3 it's called the the cost of the anointing there is a great cost to
2:41
receive the anointing there is a great price in this spiritual
2:46
realm and to summarize what the cost
2:52
is is surrender is complete
2:58
surrender to Jesus surrender of your entire
3:04
life every part not just what you want to surrender what's easier to surrender
3:10
but everything surrendering your dreams for God's dreams maybe some of
3:19
your dreams are from God and are his dreams too but maybe not maybe some of
3:25
your dreams are good dreams but they're just not God's dreams surrender includes surrendering
3:31
your will what you want the timing of of
3:38
things the timing of promises from God you surrender your will for God's
3:47
Will and it also
3:54
means a Death to Your Ego you surrender your ego
4:03
you surrender uh what people think of you doesn't matter anymore before surrender
4:11
this is very important but now you are surrendering
4:16
it and you're saying I don't care what people think of me I don't care anyone's
4:22
opinion I just care about God's opinion that's surrender and you really mean it
4:28
and you live live that way Hallelujah um it it it means denying
4:36
your flesh death to self denying what you
4:45
want for what God wants
4:53
Hallelujah most Christians don't pay much of a
4:58
cost most Christians don't pay much of a cost that's why they're not walking in the
5:07
anointing most Christians think they are giving up so much by living pretty
5:15
morally stopping drinking stopping
5:21
swearing picking up the Bible five minutes a day getting up early to go to church
5:30
they think they're giving up a lot they think that's all there is to it but people in the world can do that
5:37
much people in the world can live morally in some
5:42
ways people in the world they talk you know you see them on the news and everything yes I've stopped drinking and
5:49
they they act professional they don't swear people in the world live this way
5:55
even it's not much of a cost that's hard hardly anything that's that's very small
6:03
compared to what God wants the cost the death to self that he
6:08
wants you to do
6:14
amen and so um the the another big part
6:21
of surrender is is is something that so many people Skip
6:28
by Lord Lord I Surrender everything and you they stop certain
6:34
sins but they forget one of the most important parts of
6:39
surrender and this is to put other people before
6:52
yourself I repeat that again to put other people before your for
7:04
yourself the the the greatest Commandment that we were reading um last week is love the Lord your God with all
7:10
your heart soul mind and strength and number two love your neighbor as
7:16
yourself but as yourself doesn't mean love your neighbor
7:22
equally it means the way we naturally put ourselves first you need to take
7:28
that and put that for other people
7:35
hallelujah because Matthew 2016 says the last will be first and the first
7:41
last so put yourself last put other people first don't put you and the other
7:48
person together put them before and you go behind Matthew 26 uh sorry 1 Corinthians
7:55
20: 24 no one should seek their own good but the good of
8:04
others no one should seek their own good but the good of others it doesn't say
8:11
you should seek your own good and also equally the good of
8:18
others the world's way and even it creeps into the Christian worlds too is
8:24
to love yourself first
8:32
but that's not biblical we receive love from
8:39
God and then we fall in love with God we give our lives to him to
8:45
Jesus we have relationship with him his love is so powerful that he opens up our
8:52
eyes to see how worthy we are of his love our eyes open up to see how
8:59
beautifully he has made us our eyes open up to see the great plans he has for us
9:07
our eyes open up to see that we are worthy to be used by God so we receive all this Confidence
9:14
from God but a Godly confidence not a uh
9:21
a prideful confidence but a Godly
9:27
confidence where now now we are confident in in how God has created us
9:32
from inside to outside the world calls it loving yourself but we got to make sure we're
9:39
not uh inter you interpreting that word wrongly accept you accept yourself
9:46
you're confident in yourself you're confident with with God in you and how
9:52
he's made you you're not lacking anything but you you're not loving
9:58
yourself like I love I want my desires I'm thinking about what I
10:06
want I'm feeling myself as the world says your focus is not on loving
10:15
yourself your focus is on loving God and loving people and you are not
10:21
insecure you are not thinking negatively about yourself in fact that's being selfish because your attention's there
10:28
but you simply accept this beautiful creation that God's made and you know the purpose of this
10:35
creation yourself is to not fulfill your own
10:40
desires and chase your dreams it is not to follow your heart and chase your dreams you know that that's not your
10:47
calling here but rather it's to follow God's heart and God's dreams rather is to be a
10:54
vessel of God for the purpose of of reaching
10:59
others and bringing them into the kingdom that's your purpose you are here on this Earth for the loss to be saved
11:07
for it to be for for God to do it through you for them to be healed delivered know
11:15
God's love that's why you're [Applause]
11:22
here but so so many times we're thinking well what's my passions what's my dream how will I be the happiest in life how
11:30
will I best use my skills for My Success so I can make more money and be
11:35
successful and look good and look important and feel good and be feeling
11:41
myself right but that's completely wrong our heart our eyes should be not
11:48
on ourselves at all but completely on God and we should take care of ourselves
11:56
not because we love ourselves but but because because we love other
12:01
people we should take care of ourselves so that we can be the best vessels of God that we can
12:08
be we live in a physical body we have a soul we got to take care of those
12:17
parts Hallelujah we we need intimacy with God because
12:24
that's how we're even able to be powerful vessels of God when we transform more into his image as we look upon him and spend time with him so we
12:32
need to set aside time just to be with God personal time but that's not you know being
12:41
selfish that's loving God and loving people but we also got to make sure a
12:47
lot of people a lot of Christians they want to have uh they want to live a Christian Life their own way they want
12:53
to have a relationship with God their own way for a lot of people it's not fun
12:58
to serve other people to love people when it's hard they'd rather sit in the
13:04
room all day reading the Bible and praying and worshipping when God's calling them to get out there to not be in the room the
13:11
whole day or even most of the day but just small part of the day to be with Jesus intimately but then go out so
13:19
people can even be selfish in their relationship with
13:25
God right so we we take we take care of our soul because we are a human body and
13:31
God says we need rest we need rest we need rest for for for refreshing it's
13:36
how we're built but when we take a rest even when we go on
13:41
vacation we should see it as as this is this is not for me not that you don't
13:48
deserve it but this is not for me but this is purposeful this rest this
13:53
vacation is purposeful because I'm going to be a better servant of God better vessel of
13:58
God after this rest and refreshment so I can love people better
14:04
so even you're at the rest time you're at you're on vacation and you're thinking about loving
14:15
people you're not you're not thinking how can I have the most fun yes have fun
14:21
but your eyes are actually never inward on yourself is how God wants us to
14:26
live because we're called to be last not first we are called to look for the good
14:33
of others not ourselves God's got our back God's taken
14:39
care of us we don't have to look for our own interests we don't have to look for
14:44
doors to open we don't have to look for networking we don't have to make things
14:51
happen but it's a spiritual Principle as you do what God commands as you serve
14:57
him serve his people love his people put them first God's hand will be then so
15:04
powerfully on your life bringing success for his glory bringing open doors for His
15:11
Glory Hallelujah praise
15:20
God you should care for your physical body you should you should exercise you
15:26
should take take time out of your day to exercise you should eat well eat healthy
15:34
drink water you should care how you dress I'm
15:41
not talking about the price of the clothes but put yourself
15:47
together put your whole self look looking good but not so you can feel
15:57
yourself this is the theme of the message don't feel yourself look after others amen not so you can feel yourself
16:05
and and look in the mirror look how pretty you're looking how skinny you look see how people looking at you
16:11
impressed with how you look how your how your appearance
16:16
looks but you should be doing this to represent God
16:27
well you should be taking care of your body eating well so you have the most energy possible the most energy and
16:35
strength possible so you can love people the very best sometimes our flesh gets in the way
16:43
simply because we're not taking care of our body we start to get annoyed with somebody and we can't love them well we
16:49
can't be patient because we're feeling tired because we're not taking care of our body we're not getting good sleep
16:56
we're not eating well so we're literally feeling feeling sluggish the whole day so you're not able to be strong in the
17:02
spirit when you need to be when you need to not lash out but bite your
17:08
tongue say something kind rather than say something mean but really this this should be the
17:16
heart behind when we go to exercise it shouldn't be like oh yeah I'm going to look real good my body's going to look
17:22
good I'm going to impress some men I'm going to impress some women or at least and and people I'm
17:28
going to post the pictures on the Instagram people be like oo you looking good I can't wait for those
17:34
likes and so you're running down the street you're at the gym oh I can't wait for those likes going to make me feel
17:42
good about myself feel myself some more you order the salad oh yeah I'm
17:49
going to I'm going to be looking fit people are thinking about this
17:55
though as they take care of themselves and you should take care of of yourselves but as you're doing these things you should be thinking about God
18:01
and other people you you start you start you start
18:08
treating your body better and you start noticing difference you start noticing you have more energy and so when you're
18:14
when you're working out you're jogging or something you're thinking wow God thank you so much I'm seeing a difference I'm seeing how I'm able to be
18:20
a better vessel of you I'm able to love people better this is amazing Lord thank you you know your mind is there your
18:26
mind is on other people as you're taking care of yourself [Applause]
18:42
Hallelujah Matthew 16:24 then Jesus said to his disciples whoever wants to be my
18:47
disciple must deny themselves and take up their
18:55
cross and follow me for whoever wants to save their life
19:02
will lose it but whoever loses their life for me will find
19:10
it so he's saying if you want to be my disciple if you want to be a vessel of
19:16
my anointing so I can use powerfully through you so I can move powerfully
19:22
through you you have to deny yourself daily
19:29
you have to take up your cross taking up your cross simply means doing things you don't want to
19:35
do for the sake of Jesus and what he's calling you to taking up your cross
19:41
means putting people before you again and again and again and
19:47
again Ministry is all about other
19:52
people that's how true Ministry should be preaching should be from this place
20:00
of in the heart of God has released Revelation to me that has changed my
20:06
life and I want to see these people that God has entrusted me with to listen to
20:13
receive from I want to see them receive what I've received I want to see their
20:19
lives be changed as my have been changed as mine has been changed by this Revelation I want to see their spiritual
20:26
eyes open up for every preacher for every person
20:32
preaching that should be the heart
20:39
100% when you have that heart it'll give you strength to do it when it's hard I know from experience I never wanted to
20:46
be a preacher I never wanted to I had no clue how to
20:52
preach but my spiritual father now Prophet Dr Jord Davy prophesied I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
20:59
when I wanted to be a singer and public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness and I was relieved when I
21:05
didn't have to take public speaking in college because it was that much of a weakness and fear for
21:12
me but what kept me going when it was really hard in the beginning before God
21:17
gave me more ability and transformed my heart to enjoy it more what gave me
21:22
strength was loving my love for people God commanded me to love his
21:28
people and so me making the intention to love his people so I'd renew my
21:34
mind this Revelation that God's given me to preach has changed my life and I want to release it to these
21:42
people so their eyes will open up so even though it's so uncomfortable for me I don't like doing this
21:49
but these people their eyes will open up they will grow in the spirit they will
21:54
be free by this word so it would give me strength it would give me motivation it
21:59
would even give me passion that I didn't have prior preaching but one stepping up
22:05
to preach at that renewing in the mind kicked in oh these words are really
22:11
lifechanging these words are really going to change people's lives that should be the heart that that
22:18
that that's what Ministry is that's what it's supposed to be it's not supposed to be a show it's not to be it's not
22:24
supposed to be a way for people to gain a platform and influence and followers and money and popularity and
22:32
network and a place where you can feel good about yourself and feel yourself again and a place where people can uh uh
22:39
look at how amazing you are and how successful you are it's not supposed to be about that at all it's supposed to be
22:46
100% love for [Applause]
22:53
people and when you really love people you can preach and preach day after day
22:58
after day even when that's not your passion that's what I found God has given me the strength to do that's it's
23:04
not even difficult and hard because by his grace he's given me a heart for his
23:10
people and so that's all that matters that's what comes first is God's people
23:16
it comes first before everything before everything in my life
23:22
in my personal life people come first God and people but but they're
23:28
together God's heart is always his people so whenever you love go love people you are serving God you are
23:35
pleasing God you are in his will
23:41
[Applause] Hallelujah and so that's preaching
23:47
praying for people praying for the sick casting out demons it should be
23:54
completely about love for people 100% about love for people I want
24:00
to see these people healed freed I don't want to see them stuck in
24:06
bondage anymore stuck with this sickness anymore stuck with this generational curse
24:11
anymore I love them and so I will go face to face with these nasty
24:17
demons look them in the eye and their ugly eye and stand firm and walk in
24:22
authority and command them to go because of my love for people
24:32
I will go through the uncomfortable times that it it takes you don't you don't immediately become a professional
24:37
demon uh demon Caster
24:44
outer you you you you don't immediately become that way the anointing makes things very easy because it's anointing
24:51
that does everything but you have to you have to grow in the anointing and God likes you to stay humble so he doesn't make you professional on day one
25:00
so I remember the early days I remember the early days the anointing has had not grown to
25:07
the full capacity as it is today the early days I didn't know everything I
25:13
know in the spiritual realm now I didn't know everything about demons that I do now and so the early
25:19
days of casting out demons look so different from now from today in the early days these demons I've had demons
25:27
spit at me a couple times in the face literally I've had demons mock me
25:34
several times I've had demons get up in my face through a man and and people were afraid
25:40
that they were that man was going to hit me beat me up or something because so much anger was coming from actually the
25:47
demon not the man but a grown man grown men multiple men multiple men grown men
25:52
tall way taller than me bigger than me but a demon possessed them at the time
25:57
and you know looked really scary intimidating like in my face you know
26:04
that's you know that's that's not exactly fun right but but man you can have anger for
26:13
those demons righteous anger for those demons when you have love for [Applause]
26:20
people you don't care if they spit in your face I don't care I want to see this person
26:26
free you don't care if they mock you you don't care if it takes longer than you
26:32
want it to you don't care if um you maybe you're growing in the Lord and you
26:38
don't know all the keys yet and you have to say keep believing for full freedom God
26:45
is doing it God is bringing this complete Freedom you don't give up because you don't know all the answers
26:52
right away you know you put your um you put your reput a on the
26:59
line when you really love people when you really love people you
27:04
will say things that offend the religious spirit when you really love people and
27:12
want to see them set free you will speak what God is telling you to speak and say this is a prophetic
27:19
key I see that offends the religious spirit because it's a new
27:26
wine and they don't understand it's a new way that God is
27:32
moving that's what kept me I mean I remember sometime many times revealing
27:38
prophetic keys to people because not all Deliverance is just the same key there's
27:44
different keys that unlock different kinds of bondages there's certain bondages that
27:50
are really um really high level demonic Powers a
27:56
lot of witchcraft um it's all different so there's different keys that
28:02
are needed to unlock the complete deliverance for different people and I
28:08
remember there's been several times where Holy Spirit revealed to me this is a key this is a prophetic key that
28:15
unlocks their deliverance and I could I already knew I
28:20
knew that religious spirit was going to be so offended I knew there were probably be
28:27
made be videos made about this after I said it
28:35
exposing the Pharisee spirits of today I knew it and so I could have just kept
28:45
quiet I could have even said speak to me
28:52
later and told the person in private but by the grace of of God he
28:58
gave me a heart for his people where I really love that person I wanted to see them set free and not just that I wanted
29:06
to see other people set free who also needed the same key so I unashamedly boldly spoke the truth that I knew would
29:15
end up being leading to the Pharisees persecuting
29:21
me and and and and I've seen even you know the same things happened to Jesus
29:27
happened to me like Jesus he spoke something about something that offended
29:32
the religious that they didn't understand a new wine a new wine teaching such as eat my Eat My Flesh and
29:40
drink my blood he speaks this sermon of course we know he's speaking about
29:46
communion right he's speaking about how he is the he is the bread of life we
29:51
must consume and the blood his blood is what saves us heals us us so we must
29:58
drink of it we must take it spiritually and physically in the
30:03
communion but when he first began to bring this brand new wine the people did not understand what we understood now
30:10
they were in the old wine skin and so the Bible says that so many people so many not just people his own disciples
30:17
left him because they were so offended and so I've seen the same thing
30:23
happen where I released new wine I released prophetic keys that unlock
30:29
deliverance and I've seen many disciples not just random people but disciples
30:37
leave and so your your love for people is tested if you will love people more
30:44
than you will love yourself more than you will love your influence platform
30:52
reputation it is tested and you know
30:57
I remember the first the first time before many disciples left I didn't know that would happen but
31:05
then God would reveal would lead me to keep on doing this to keep on speaking what he was telling me to
31:12
speak but these next times I knew what would be coming I knew the Pharisees were
31:20
watching and waiting for a clickbait worthy
31:25
moment to twist and use it to lead many people
31:33
astray so my love for people was tested if I loved them more than I loved
31:40
myself and by God's grace he gave me the strength he gave me such strong love for
31:46
people that I was able to keep doing that and not shrink back not be
31:52
ashamed and put people first Hallelujah
31:57
[Applause] Hallelujah this is this is one of the
32:04
biggest areas of where people miss miss it when it comes to receiving the
32:10
anointing is sacrificial love for others sacrificing
32:16
yourself for the sake of loving others I'm giving you a secret a big
32:24
secret this is one of the biggest secrets of receiving the anointing it's one of the biggest parts of the cost is
32:32
laying down your life denying yourself picking up the cross and loving people before yourself
32:40
putting people before yourself this is the not fun
32:48
part this is the daily not fun part denying yourself part daily that most
32:54
Christians don't want to do but it is required it is the cost
32:59
part of the cost of receiving the anointing because the anointing God's
33:05
power is not for you is not to make your dreams come true but if you do not have
33:11
this kind of heart where you truly love people more than yourself and you still
33:17
love yourself quite in some areas the anointing will come and you will use it
33:22
for yourself you will you it's real power it
33:28
makes you look impressive it it's something that people
33:33
want from you like a gift like like these these singers
33:39
famous singers in the world they have a gift and they want it so they go to them right the anointing is like that but
33:45
even more powerful because it can really change people's lives instead of bringing em emotion
33:51
satisfaction touch your heart for a moment it changes lives it destroys
33:58
yolks so people can use it to get people to come to them and get whatever they want
34:05
money Fame if you do not have this True Heart
34:11
the devil will find these areas where you love yourself and entice you and you will use the
34:18
anointing for your own gain that's why this heart is
34:24
required you should live your life Life With This Heart of putting others
34:32
first you your real calling is a servant of
34:41
God not not I'm a Christian no you're a
34:52
servant that's what it means to be Christian that's what it means to be a follower of Jesus Matthew
35:00
20:25 Jesus knowing their thoughts called them to his side and said this is the passion
35:06
translation Jesus knew the thoughts of the disciples okay and he called them to his side and said Kings and those with
35:13
great Authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects like
35:19
tyrants but this is not your calling you will lead by a completely
35:26
different mind model the greatest one among you will
35:32
live as the one who is called to serve others because the greatest honor and
35:39
Authority is reserved for the one with the heart of a servant for even the son of man did not
35:46
come expecting to be served by everyone but to serve everyone and to give his
35:53
life in exchange for the Salvation of
35:58
many this is powerful I'm going to read this again you are not like the world the world is
36:06
looking for people to serve them the world is looking for gratification
36:11
themselves they wake up this day saying what do I want where do I want to go how can I have
36:19
fun that's that's how they live but your calling is completely different this verse is not just speaking for people
36:25
who are Kings he not saying when you are a king you shouldn't be like the kings of the world you should be this way he's
36:31
not just saying that to the Kings he's saying that to you who are not a king or queen you where you are in your life now
36:38
he's speaking this to
36:44
you you the greatest one among you will live as the one who was called to serve
36:49
others because the greatest honor and Authority is reserved for the one who with the heart of a servant powerful
36:57
the ones who will be greatest in the Kingdom carry great anointing with great
37:05
callings bringing the most fruit for the kingdom will be this way will be a
37:11
servant of others the the greatest honor is given
37:18
to them because they are doing the most for the kingdom the only way to do the most for
37:26
the kingdom is to be a servant so see see this is the key of how to receive the
37:31
anointing the anointing comes when you become a
37:38
servant when you live your life as a servant you should start living your
37:44
life now as a servant don't wait for the opportunity There's an opportunity all
37:51
the time all the time there's opportunities
37:58
I remember when God first called me when it was like nine months before
38:04
when he first called me it was nine months before I started fivefold church it was nine
38:11
months nine months of renewing my mind learning and
38:17
renewing my mind of what it meant to be
38:23
surrendered and to be a servant of God I I realized wow God has this huge
38:30
calling on my life God says I'm going to I'm called to reach the Nations and many shocking
38:35
Miracles will happen and I didn't see myself doing this at all I mean this was
38:40
just so shocking to me you know I looked to other ministers like in awe in awe
38:46
I'd only seen like two people ever even walk in the power of God so I didn't
38:51
ever like picture myself I just saw myself as a normal Christian young woman
38:57
singer super normal that's how I saw myself but I really believe this
39:03
prophetic word of this huge calling and my spiritual father and I knew how impartation works right impartation like
39:10
Elijah to Elisha so I knew this this great powerful anointing like I've never seen in my life that I saw my spiritual
39:16
father walk in I knew that I was going to receive that anointing so it was shocking this is
39:23
wild what God is calling me to I knew it even though it was like hard to
39:28
imagine but I believed but it humbled me so much it
39:34
humbled me um to make sure that I would have the heart that God really wanted to
39:40
use I knew I had work to do I wanted to make sure my heart could
39:45
really be trusted I wanted to make sure that when it came time for God to fulfill these promises and I would start
39:51
to see that anointing pour in my life that I would be serving God perfectly like I I I would never misuse his
39:58
anointing one moment that was very important in my heart I wanted that more than
40:04
anything and so that led me to really looking in his word and and and
40:11
and renewing my mind wow I'm called to be a servant this anointing he's entrusting me with it's purely for other
40:18
people it's purely for God's love and now my love for other
40:24
people this is why he's giving me this whole calling because of God's love for people and because I love God and love
40:30
his people okay so I started realizing wow I
40:37
have to be a servant I have to live my life as a servant I have to serve other people and
40:43
never look for what I want and so I started living my life differently once I grabbed hold of that
40:49
Revelation around that time when I first received the prophecy and I started seeking God and renewing my mind and so
40:57
I just remember like anytime I was with friends anytime after church if we were going to get dinner or something like
41:04
that I would just you know renew my mind and discipline myself just immediately
41:09
deny myself that I would be a servant to them that I would
41:16
drive that that I would let them choose where they want to eat that if people were at my house for
41:24
we would have Bible study back in those days is I would just serve
41:30
everyone make tea uh prepare um food you know I I trained my mind that I must
41:38
serve everyone that no one should serve
41:45
me I trained my mind that way whenever I was with people I'm a
41:50
servant I'll help I'll do this I'll drive where do you want to go it doesn't
41:56
does matter what I want not that you can't ever do
42:02
something you want go someplace to eat you have to learn how to receive too go someplace
42:09
you want to eat you have to learn to receive too there will come a time where your where your friend they want to
42:15
serve you they're grabbing hold this Revelation you know no no where do you
42:22
want to eat that's okay okay you you want you want to know okay you know that learn you have to be able to
42:27
receive too because then you'll be the only one serving and no one else can serve they got to serve to go up higher
42:34
too you know what I'm you know what I'm saying but but a lot of people are not in this place and so you have a great
42:41
opportunity to to discipline yourself to be a servant this is where God is training
42:48
you in your ordinary
42:53
life husband Hal Hallelujah husbands and
42:58
wives serve each other do the dishes have that heart I'm going to
43:05
serve my wife I'm going to serve my husband clean up make the bed the things
43:11
that they always do you do it before they can many times make the intention
43:18
I'm going to be a servant to my
43:23
spouse roommates some of you have roommates serve your
43:29
roommate help them do things for them this is this is how it happened for
43:35
me this is where God started to build this heart in me and train me it takes training and disciplining this is God
43:42
molding you when you go out in the day to day and you're I'm a servant Renewing Your
43:48
Mind I'm a servant and you serve and this amazing thing happens he literally changes you he molds your heart where
43:55
you start forgetting about yourself in a good
44:01
way because our flesh our flesh is like I want this I want to watch this movie I
44:07
want to drink I want to binge ah it's like a strong
44:13
urge but the more you deny yourself pick up your cross renew your mind that flesh
44:19
dies so a lot of the thing that's getting in the way from you being a servant of God is that you're not
44:24
denying your flesh you got to deny your flesh in this area when it comes to just
44:30
simply putting others first
44:38
[Applause]
44:54
amen so
45:01
um I when I was sharing earlier about how you should not be taking care of
45:08
yourself for yourself but for others when you take
45:14
care of your personal self your personal life your physical body and then you put on Christ you you
45:23
make the intention to serve other people and love others when they look at you
45:29
they won't be thinking ooh they're pretty they're handsome ooh they're
45:37
successful wow but rather all they can see is
45:42
Jesus they're like wow there're that yes you're representing god well you're
45:48
looking good physically but more so inside is overpowering what people can even see on
45:54
the outside like they are so impressed by this love because sacrificial love can only be
46:01
done by God sacrificial love can only happen by
46:06
God's power so when you love people sacrificially when you love people and put them first continually and serve
46:13
them they notice and they will see Jesus in you and you will at least be planting
46:21
seeds you might not they might not know it was Jesus that day but you will be planting seeds as they recognize this
46:28
sacrificial love this Godly love through other people later on those seeds will
46:34
come to harvest [Applause]
46:44
Hallelujah most um most kinds of love in this world is
46:51
like trying to get something out of people it's it's it's looking after
46:56
yourself a lot of people they're looking after they're loving people to look after their self I'll scratch your back
47:02
you scratch mine they're manipulating people through
47:10
love this is the opposite of what God is calling us to even in the body of
47:18
Christ this is prevalent this love that's
47:24
fake these these scratching your back so
47:31
you'll scratch mine we got to be
47:36
different we must be pure we must really love people which is really putting them
47:44
first and denying ourselves there's a scripture that I
47:49
read a little bit earlier that talks about how we should look at the good of others look at the uh no one should seek
47:56
their own good but the good of others 1 Corinthians 10:24 no one should seek their own good but the good of
48:05
others this does not just apply to your friends and those who are easy to
48:12
love this applies to those who are hardest to love because God is calling
48:18
you to love them all all [Applause]
48:23
people including your enemies
48:28
did you know that we are called to be like Jesus like Jesus in every
48:36
way that's how we will be the most effective for the kingdom that's how God can see us as the most trustworthy to
48:42
pour the anointing and that's when we will walk in the most powerful anointing and bring real change real salvation
48:48
healing and deliverance is when we are truly like
48:53
Jesus and guess what what Jesus is calling us to be like him in every
49:02
way every way some people are are are not raising
49:09
the bar high enough oh that's Jesus I'm Not Jesus I can't do that yes you can with God's
49:18
help you can do hard things that he's calling you to do you can put people
49:24
first you can love everyone even your
49:29
enemies with God's strength he's living in you there's nothing you cannot do
49:34
with god so let's look at this example of
49:39
Jesus this this is what we're supposed to do this is a way that we're supposed to be like him Luke
49:49
23:33 when they called when when they came to a place called the skull they nailed him to the Cross they nailed
49:55
Jesus to the cross and the criminals were also crucified one on his right and one on
50:00
his left Jesus said father forgive them for they don't know what they are
50:08
doing and the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice so these people
50:13
that were putting him on the cross were doing something so evil as gambling for
50:19
his clothes right before him as he's dying on the cross
50:26
Jesus lived a perfect sinless life Jesus did nothing but love
50:32
everybody he brought the most good to this world at this time to everybody
50:40
there he brought salvation and healing and deliverance and Abundant Life
50:47
yet he was put to death he was charged as
50:52
guilty of death and he was put on a cross the most horrible death Nails put
50:58
in his hands Nails put in his feet a th a crown of thorns on his
51:04
head and it was a slow painful death many hours he's
51:11
hanging and in the middle of that intense pain intense Agony Jesus
51:18
completely innocent he says father forgive them for
51:24
they don't know what they are doing father forgive them for they know
51:31
not what they're doing he's saying this to the murderers of him the ones making fun of him mocking
51:38
him this is the powerful sacrificial love of Jesus this is this powerful love that
51:44
he's putting others first before him that he's concerned about their salvation more than himself being
51:51
justified and having the a good reputation
51:57
he he could have been on that cross in that pain and yelled
52:03
aloud you are literally murdering the Messiah right now and you will see this
52:09
is true he could say watch it I would repent now if I were you you will reap
52:17
what you sow do you know the evil that you are
52:24
doing everyone here I am
52:29
innocent I am innocent I have done no wrong Jesus could have done
52:38
that everything I just said wasn't even that mean it was truth
52:46
right but he loved people so much he loved people more than the
52:55
importance of defending himself than the importance of his
53:01
reputation the importance of how other people saw him he knew God he knew the truth would
53:07
come out he didn't need to do it himself speak at himself he knew the principles you reap
53:14
what you sow he didn't need to announce it and make people feel
53:19
bad and put more hate and negativity on
53:25
on these people who deserved it but he didn't do that instead he he was nothing
53:31
but love for these horrible enemies doing such evil things murdering
53:36
him he cared about their salvation he chose to not speak badly about them when
53:43
they're doing the most evil thing to him that anybody could do that's a powerful love that's
53:50
sacrificial love that's called putting others before yourself that's called putting yourself last and others
53:59
first and this is what God is calling us to this is the aspect of Jesus that many
54:06
people think that's Jesus I can't do that that's Jesus I'm just a
54:16
human and they're never used powerfully by God and God can never trust them with
54:22
the anointing God is calling you to do this kind of hard thing that Jesus did of
54:28
forgiving your enemies of loving them and actually
54:33
wanting the best for them in the midst of them doing evil towards
54:38
you because nobody is too far gone and nobody I don't care what
54:45
they've done no nobody should desire for someone to go to hell for
54:51
eternity I don't care what evil they've done to you most people do evil things because they
54:59
have so much demonic oppression they they've been abused all their life and
55:04
they don't know any better they're being controlled by demons but there's a soul there there's a soul underneath that
55:11
demonic oppression that's just as worthy of Salvation and God's love as
55:17
you that could have been you if you didn't have the background you did if you didn't have the upbringing you
55:23
had if you didn't encounter God's love through these friends that introduced you to Jesus that person didn't get that
55:29
chance yet if we can see people that
55:37
way if we can see that God still loves them even be behind all the
55:49
ugliness there's a very powerful story of God's sacrificial love example of God's sacrificial love love in the Bible
55:55
which is Saul being transformed to Paul Saul murdered many
56:04
Christians he was doing the worst thing anybody could do because he was literally trying to stop the work of God
56:12
doing to the highest extreme to the highest degree stop God's work which was
56:18
leading to people not receiving Jesus being set free and healed and saved
56:24
that's the worst thing anybody can do is to go against attack Servants of
56:30
God because God chooses to use vessels the anointing comes through vessels so
56:36
it's the worst thing anybody can do worst thing because God is using that vessel
56:44
to reach that Ministry to reach millions of people to be saved healed and
56:50
delivered and those millions of people will multiply into billions
56:57
so this is why it's the the worst thing you can do so so sa Saul was doing the worst thing anybody could
57:04
do by persecuting the Christians and killing them
57:10
even the worst evil many Christians not just
57:15
one but our God's love is something
57:23
else because behind all that ugliness God saw a soul that he
57:31
loved and he wanted to save and [Music] redeem and even use him for his
57:40
glory in the middle of that evil God wanted his
57:48
salvation and so the story goes that Jesus on the road to Damas Damascus as
57:55
as as Saul is going on a mission to persecute more Christians on the road to Damascus Jesus blinds
58:03
Saul and in that moment Saul is like he his his spiritual eyes are
58:11
opening in this moment uh realizing that this is
58:20
God he fell to the ground and Heard a Voice say to him Saul Saul why do you persecute me who are you Lord Saul asked
58:28
I am Jesus whom you are persecuting he replied now get up and go into the City and you will be told what you must
58:34
do and then we're going to skip a couple uh scriptures and it goes on to say the Lord called to him in a vision ananas
58:40
this is one of the the the Disciples of Jesus yes Lord he answered the Lord told him go into the house of Judas on
58:46
Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul for he is praying in a
58:51
vision he has seen a man named ananas come and place his hands on him to restore his sight Lord ananas answered I
58:57
have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem and he has come
59:03
here with authority from the chief priest to to arrest all who call in your name but the Lord said to ananas go this
59:10
man is My Chosen instrument to Proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings
59:16
and to the people of Israel I will show him how much he must
59:21
suffer for my name then ananas went to the house and Ed it placing his hands on Saul he said brother Saul the Lord Jesus
59:28
who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here has sent me to you so you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit immediately something like
59:34
scales fell from Saul's eyes and he could see again he got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regained his strength Saul spent several
59:41
days with the disciples in Damascus and then at once he began to preach in the
59:47
synagogues that Jesus is the son of
59:53
God [Applause]
1:00:03
wow may you see the story with new eyes today because I know a lot of you know this
1:00:08
story but can we just maybe we can think of it modern times today imagine someone killing Christians
1:00:18
today imagine someone persecuting you trying
1:00:25
to stop you from doing the work of God speaking against you saying that you are false saying that you are from the devil saying that you are a witch a warlock
1:00:33
someone's saying this about you and your Christian
1:00:39
friends and now Jesus reveals that he actually wants to redeem
1:00:46
this guy and use him and even make him this
1:00:51
Mighty Apostle who's doing extraordinary Miracles High level anointing and be a leader in the body of
1:00:58
Christ like a top leader and right most the New Testament
1:01:04
even but but but and then then he has this encounter his eyes open up wow I've
1:01:10
been so wrong I see now the truth I Repent completely I Repent of everything
1:01:17
I Repent completely but how will you feel in your
1:01:22
heart will you forgive them and even more will you desire them to be
1:01:29
redeemed will you get excited when God lifts this s this person for his
1:01:37
glory will you get excited when he's lifted higher than
1:01:42
you for the glory of God ministers out there how will you
1:01:52
feel if this servant of if this if this Paul of today is lifted higher than you
1:01:59
I'm not saying this is easy I'm not saying this is this feels
1:02:04
good but can you do it can you choose to obey God to
1:02:09
love other people your enemies your worst enemies love them so much that you
1:02:15
with obedience to God not that you're feeling inside but with obedience to God
1:02:20
you say I forgive them I want the best for them want them to be used for God's
1:02:26
glory I want blessings upon their [Applause]
1:02:33
life that is a powerful love that is
1:02:38
so rare this love is so rare in the body of
1:02:43
Christ it's saddening but I'm getting excited because Revival is now and the
1:02:49
the hearts are being purified and we're going to see people like Anna anas ananas had this amazing
1:02:57
heart but Lord he's the one persecuting us but God said I've chosen him so please do what I
1:03:04
called you to do okay Lord I Open Your Eyes by the power of God receive the
1:03:10
Holy Spirit go my brother for the for the [Applause]
1:03:16
kingdom if ananas can do it we can do it so so many of you think oh that's
1:03:23
Jesus I can't do it ananas can do it could do it so we can do
1:03:32
it when you are anointed the persecution is
1:03:38
insane the evil that comes to you is insane by fellow brothers and
1:03:43
sisters the evil things you wouldn't believe it the evil things that will
1:03:49
happen by so-called brothers and sisters in the Lord the the blatant lies that are made
1:03:56
up the backstabbing all done because of
1:04:02
jealousy because people don't many people don't really love others and love God but they love themselves too
1:04:09
much and so it is real it is ugly but
1:04:14
God is calling you to still love them you don't have to feel all in your
1:04:21
heart love but that you would love in obedience by keeping your mouth shut by not
1:04:27
defending yourself and letting God defend you by speaking good of them by
1:04:33
blessing them by forgiving them you don't have to feel in your heart I forgive just choose to forgive obey God
1:04:41
I forgive them help me Lord in my heart I forgive them help my heart to catch
1:04:48
up to what the my spirit has done and what the truth is in the spirit help me
1:04:53
not to to feel bad feelings about them I love them I bless them I forgive them I want the best in their lives let them
1:05:00
become like Paul speak this aloud and don't go eye for eye the thing
1:05:09
is is that in the body of Christ so many times this happens when you go eye for
1:05:14
eye when you feel like oh mud's been thrown on me so I need to clean myself
1:05:22
off and what will help it is to put mud on the other person and you go back and forth saying
1:05:29
he said she said
1:05:34
and all of this is producing bad fruits because we're called to to let
1:05:40
God the Bible says be still and let God defend you be still and he will fight for you
1:05:52
amen proverbs 2022 do not say I will repay evil wait
1:05:58
for the Lord and He will deliver you so so so people are doing evil to
1:06:03
you don't do evil to them back because you love them because even though they've tried
1:06:10
to destroy your reputation you don't want to destroy their reputation and you know God will handle
1:06:17
everything it's not your job to get in there and and destroy their reputation and reveal the truth about
1:06:24
them that's not your job that's God's job and he will do it he will show the
1:06:29
fruits the fruits will come out and that's how people will know because that's the biblical way we know
1:06:36
in the Bible to know who the who is real and who is not by the fruits so we got to let God do his thing
1:06:44
so the fruits can show themselves bad and good amen rather than chucking bad
1:06:50
fruits upon a person's head see their bad bad
1:06:57
fruits they Chuck bad fruits at me but I have good fruits see proving yourself
1:07:02
see what I've done Romans
1:07:10
1219 don't be obsessed with taking Revenge but leave that to God's righteous Justice for the scriptures say
1:07:16
vengeance is mine and I will repay says the Lord and if your enemy is hungry buy him lunch win him over with kindness for
1:07:23
your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience and God will reward you with favor never let evil defeat you but
1:07:29
defeat evil with
1:07:35
good Deuteronomy 24 for the Lord your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you
1:07:42
Victory so what happens is when you do these things when you be still and let God fight for you when you don't um
1:07:49
repay evil for evil when you don't try to um when you're not proudful and try
1:07:54
to show off to convince people what happens is that you're still
1:08:00
and you're letting God fight for you you are you are you are now act you're now
1:08:05
enabling God's hand to come his Supernatural
1:08:10
hand and and and and reveal himself mightily through you re prove to people
1:08:17
he's with you increase the anointing in you bring
1:08:22
out the fruits so people people can see God does that it'll open
1:08:31
doors he will attract people to like ministers he will attract people to you when you have the good fruit and you're
1:08:36
letting God do the work and you rest he will attract people for His
1:08:44
Glory Hallelujah but if you if you fight
1:08:49
yourself and don't let God fight you are not accessing his his hand you are you are disabling his hand from
1:08:59
coming and so he can't he can't bring you the victory you will not have Victory and
1:09:05
you will not show good fruits because you're not doing what God Said are you with

1:09:19
hallelujah thank you Jesus he lifts the
1:09:27
humble as you pass these tests he lifts you let him Lift
1:09:32
You by going low and humbling yourself I love I love also how this it
1:09:39
says in um Romans 1220 for your surprising generosity will awaken his
1:09:45
conscious your enemies when you buy him lunch when I'm over with kindness so you should have this heart
1:09:52
of loving other people people when people attack you when people are coming against you you should have that heart I don't want to do bad for them because I
1:10:00
just want good for them I don't want to be responsible for bringing anything bad to their lives because I love them right
1:10:07
that's how we should be but but but also we should also want them to be saved we should want their eyes to open up and
1:10:13
how will that happen the kindness of God leads to repentance most people that do evil they
1:10:20
they haven't encountered God's love enough so we should have that heart they
1:10:25
don't know God's love enough how will they know God's love through his vessels it can be through me
1:10:31
right now I'm going to repay them with kindness I'm going to give them this dose of s sacrificial love which maybe
1:10:38
they've never encountered before and this could awaken their conscience as the word
1:10:45
says you can be a vessel of God for them for that for their receiving love that they they know they don't deserve
1:10:51
because they know the evil they did to you that's a heart for others let me be
1:10:56
a vessel of God in this situation for them and let me be a vessel of God for others I got motivated when I was
1:11:02
persecuted a a period of time I I misspoke last last week it w last Sunday

1:11:13
hardest time of my life and um just lies being spoken against me publicly things

being made up and um I I have
1:11:24
motivation to do what God was saying to do like be still and be kind to your
1:11:29
enemies I got motivation because I was God I got motivation to do this in strength
1:11:36
because God spoke to me this is a chance for people to see sacrificial
1:11:41
love and humility and the real love of God like
1:11:47
maybe they've never seen before maybe they haven't seen that example before this is lifechanging this is opening
1:11:53
opening up eyes to people that this is possible that when people do so much evil to you you can respond this way it
1:11:59
is possible like an anonas version of today right you can truly be kind to
1:12:06

this word I preached it is really rare to see this in the body of Christ and
1:13:52
it's and and and it's time it changes now this is part of God purifying his bride is that we would look like this we

thank you Jesus I just want to take a moment I know that there's many of you that's
1:14:30
you're being held back right now from um loving others uh putting others first because
1:14:36
you've been hurt by others and you feel like you need to fight for yourself and
1:14:42
put yourself first because you've been taken advantage of because you've been
1:14:47
done wrong you I know you've some of you are feeling have felt this way and it's kept
1:14:52
you from denying yourself and putting others first and so we're going to take a
1:14:59
moment to forgive right now to forgive those who have hurt you to forgive your
1:15:06
enemies this is the first step right now this is an instruction that God gives us
1:15:11
remember you don't have to feel the feelings of forgiveness you probably won't but it's about
1:15:19
obedience I forgive this person because God's asking me to and so I gladly
1:15:24
forgive them maybe you're not feeling like jumping up and down but your heart
1:15:30
because you love God and you're excited to obey him you gladly forgive them so just close your eyes right now
1:15:37
and take a moment and and speak aloud these people that you need to forgive just speak aloud right now say I
1:15:44
forgive and then say the person's
1:15:52
name and say I bless

1:16:11
redeemed I want them to know God's
1:16:19
