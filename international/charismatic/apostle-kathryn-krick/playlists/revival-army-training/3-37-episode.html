today we're going to learn about territories in the spiritual Realm
0:09
territories there are territories in the spiritual Realm
0:14
when you as as a every person on this Earth they have a choice we are given
0:21
Free Will by God God has given us complete free will we have a choice how we're going to live
0:27
our lives there's different categories we can choose number one God's will which is to
0:35
surrender everything to him live completely for him
0:40
serve him that's Choice number one and when we choose that
0:47
Abundant Life is our inheritance we get to enjoy the in the reward of following Jesus
0:54
that inheritance that he's given us by dying on the cross by enduring scorching even before going on the cross shedding
1:00
all that blood is for you to be healed delivered and walk in Abundant Life that comes when you make that choice of
1:08
surrendering everything of really serving him not one foot in one foot out surrendering everything
1:14
that's Choice number one then there's um there's there's Choice oh and by the way
1:21
here it says in Acts 26 17 that
1:27
it says whom I'm sending to you this is speaking to the disciples to open their spiritual eyes so that they may turn
1:34
from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God that they may receive forgiveness and release from
1:39
their sins and an inheritance among those who have been Sanctified set apart made Holy by faith so when you turn from
1:46
Darkness completely to light completely not a little bit of Darkness here here
1:53
and there but you turn from that completely you turn to light completely and you sanctify yourself you're set
1:59
apart you're holy that is when you receive an inheritance
2:07
most people are not receiving the inheritance from Jesus the Abundant Life healing Freedom abundant of peace and
2:13
joy because they're not fully surrendered this comes when you are set apart
2:22
sanctified that's when it comes so that's Choice number one choice number two that all
2:29
people have on this Earth is to be a lukewarm Christian one foot in the world one foot out you
2:35
have that choice God gives you free will he doesn't force himself he doesn't force himself and say you have to
2:40
surrender what are you doing he gives you the choice and when you live the lukewarm life one
2:48
foot in the world one foot with God there's a good chance you would have
2:53
demonic oppression in your life there's a very good chance very good chance you have demons and you need freedom
2:59
number one number two you're not going to be really doing much for the kingdom of God if anything really
3:07
you're not gonna really you're not gonna be walking in your purpose and you're not going to be able to access Abundant
3:12
Life then there's Choice number three
3:18
that people can choose to to live as non-believers simply like uh atheists
3:25
agnostics or worshiping other gods
3:31
Buddhists Hindus there's that choice
3:37
right there and when you live like that this is when your life is going to be
3:44
having demons that's what life is looking like and
3:50
just in blindness when you're in that place you are upon
3:55
for the devil when you're in that place you don't you aren't knowing that you are
4:01
that you are working for the devil serving for the devil being used I should say being you don't know you're being used by the devil
4:08
but you're you are a pawn um like for example when you when you
4:13
are an atheist when you don't have Jesus demons can just come in and these demons
4:20
look like anxiety depression anger rage um addiction all sorts of things but for
4:26
example if you have that rage in you you're going to constantly be uh lashing
4:32
out at people so this is an example of you being a pawn for the enemy so that lashing out
4:38
being angry at people is literally speaking words of death over people and this is having a spiritual impact
4:44
this is making people to um you're speaking false identity over
4:49
people you're making people to be insecure um and not see who they are and walk
4:55
confidently in their purpose see so we have the spectrum of of
5:02
serving God you're doing great exploits for Jesus you're doing such an impact in the Kingdom advancing the kingdom
5:08
destroying the works of the devil living your purpose and walk in an abundant life then you have lukewarm Christian where
5:14
you're just not doing much and on top of that you don't have Abundant Life right and then you have the the atheists
5:22
and the worshiping other gods and you are being a pawn and you don't have Abundant Life at all
5:27
you have demons and then there's this last choice that everybody
5:33
has free will to make and that's to be a real servant of Satan
5:41
to be a witch to be a warlock to actively be doing the devil's work
5:51
putting I mean witchcraft is putting curses on people it is witches are the ones that actually send demons
5:59
they send them out to people they're doing works
6:05
so the devil's using just like God uses us to be vessels of the anointing and
6:10
destroy the works of the devil so cast demons out devil uses vessels
6:17
to put demonic powers in them and demonic powers to be sent out to people
6:24
so this is this is the choice that we have we all have complete free will we
6:30
are not pressured by God in any way we have complete free will
6:36
all right so it's very important to understand that we have this Free Will and these are all the different choices
6:42
that people make these are the choices that we have now many people they they blame God so many
6:50
times when they see a good thing uh bad things happening to good people or they
6:56
themselves have sickness bad things happening in their lives
7:01
um early deaths and families and friends for example so many people Christians included blame
7:08
God like in their minds it's like God is in
7:14
control how could he allow this to happen but this is because
7:20
most people don't understand that's number one we have complete free will
7:30
Free Will who we serve what we open up ourselves to
7:37
what territories we will go in we have free will of what so seeds we're
7:44
going to sow and what reaping will will happen to us we have complete Free Will number one
7:50
number two as a believer
7:55
God has given you Authority
8:04
yes God can do anything yes God is in control but many people think he's in
8:09
control like a puppeteer he's not he gives us free will which in
8:15
that regard means he's he chooses to not control
8:22
right so the God when he created Humanity he put
8:28
Adam and Eve there the first humans and he says let them have dominion
8:38
so when he did that he was literally giving his authority giving it to humans
8:45
that they would have dominion over the Earth
8:50
this was God's plan this was God's Will and now Adam and Eve lost that Demi that Dominion that authority to the devil
8:56
they handed over the keys basically by giving into his lies and they said basically you can have our Authority and
9:02
they got he got to take the keys so this is one of the big reasons so why Jesus came why the father sent Jesus
9:11
was to return and restore that Authority that was lost to us as children of God
9:18
so that we would have dominion again so when you become a child of God a big
9:26
part of your identity is that you have authority So today we're going to learn like what
9:33
that Authority entails because obviously we we we as a body of Christ even if
9:41
every single one of us confessed at the same time like Devil die he must die there can be no more works of darkness
9:49
that won't happen right it's because this is why this teaching
9:54
is important for you to understand today for you to learn today the devil's still allowed we're not in heaven yet heaven
10:00
will be different Heaven there's no Darkness there's no sickness but we're here on this Earth to save the
10:07
lost people have free will on this Earth we're here to do Works to save the Lost
10:14
to for God to Open Eyes through us to say the loss from going to hell that's why we're here that's what this is
10:23
this is our purpose to say rescue people from going to Hell by God working through us for for people
10:30
to see that Jesus exists and loves him and he's their Savior and Lord
10:39
that's why we're here so Devil's still gets to exist
10:47
till we go to heaven once we're out here on this Earth he still gets to exist right and people still have free will
10:55
devil's work he's allowed to still do things people are still allowed to do works of
11:03
the darkness they have free will
11:08
so Authority that we have when we are when we become a child of God
11:15
it says Luke 10 19 behold I give you the authority to trample on serpents and
11:22
scorpions and over all the power of the enemy nothing shall by any means hurt you so Jesus says this to his disciples
11:29
I give you Authority this is how we know we have authority now Jesus has given it to us
11:37
so what does that Authority look like since we know that well we can't exactly command the devil
11:43
to die right and all the works to stop so what what what is that Authority look
11:49
like so when you give your life to Jesus every single one of you immediately gets authority over the devil that's part of
11:56
your identity now you have to know this to actually be able to walk in it
12:02
or you become like Adam and Eve you know and just hand the keys over to the devil and so it's like you're not using your
12:08
Authority at all and that's how a lot of Believers are they have not received this teaching
12:13
and that's one of the biggest reasons why people don't access access Abundant Life it's because so much of accessing the
12:20
Abundant Life is walking in Authority daily is is applying the word of God daily
12:29
like reject the death the devil's lies resist the devil and he'll flee from you
12:37
take every thought captive to Christ because the one of the biggest war ways
12:44
that the devil Wars on us is the mind sending lies like you're not really free that's the
12:51
scheme of the devil to keep you from walking in an abundant life to stay to keep you in a place of stagnancy to keep
12:57
you in a place where you can't even testify that God has freed you because the devil's convinced you he has not
13:04
that's an example but when you can reject the devil's lies I have authority when you give your life
13:09
to Jesus you have authority over your own spiritual life that's the authority you are given
13:16
meaning all these attacks of the devil many most times in your it's coming in your mind
13:22
but it can be other ways your finances your children your your ministry your
13:28
your your your your body anywhere attacks coming you have authority over the devil
13:35
over those attacks you command all the attacks to leave reject them all and declare God's truth
13:42
by his stripes I am healed all sickness has to leave I am healed I thank you Jesus for healing me
13:48
I have a sound mind every live anxiety depression must go every nightmare you
13:54
wake up from a nightmare this is what you do I reject that dream
13:59
that's it that's what I do it works great yeah
14:05
once in a while I've found the devil try to come with a nightmare once in a great for me it's not much
14:12
um but once in a while great while it's just a lie so I wake up I reject
14:17
that lie I know exactly what it is don't let it freak me out
14:23
I I don't let it be I don't let the devil lie to me and make me think that it's me and because a big scheme of the
14:29
devil is to like have you do something bad in the dream sinful and so that you'd wake up and think oh
14:36
my gosh why would I dream that like am I bad I must be bad right
14:45
but you you know exactly what the devil's doing so you wake up I reject it and you move on with your day and he has
14:51
no power resist the devil and he must be and that's what happened that's what happens for me I don't get another dream recurring
14:56
dream this is what happens when you walk in authority don't let them fool you reject
15:04
s declare God's truth so you're declaring God's truth you're what you're plowing like you're walking you're
15:09
prophesying you're taking territory into the Abundant Life
15:15
amen we are given um territory
15:22
Joshua 1 4. it says your territory this is God speaking to Joshua your territory will
15:29
extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the Great River the Euphrates all that hits a tight country to the
15:36
Mediterranean Sea in the West no one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life as I was with
15:41
Moses so I will be with you I will never leave you and nor forsake you be strong and courageous because you will lead
15:46
these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them be strong and very courageous in other
15:53
words be strong against the devil schemes and walk in your Authority and claim this territory that I've already
15:58
given you don't shrink back be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you do not
16:04
turn from it to the right or to the left that you may say that you may be successful wherever you go keep this
16:10
book of the law always on your lips meditate it on it day at night so so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be
16:17
prosperous and successful this is the simple way of receiving
16:23
Abundant Life is to take the word of God so seriously meditate on it so you are
16:29
sharp in the spiritual realm so you know what God's truth is so you're quick to reject every lie of the devil
16:35
you're quick too and so you're able to walk in this Authority effectively every
16:40
day devil walking in this Authority taking the land in the spiritual Realm
16:48
rather than the lies you believe in you don't know the word of God that much
16:54
Devil's tricking you in sneaky ways and then you like shrinking back and you're staying stagnant or you're going
16:59
backwards instead of that you meditate on the word of God you take it seriously
17:06
like the word of God said there and then you will be prosperous then you'll be walking in your Authority
17:11
and you'll be taking the land you'll be prosperous successful walking in Abundant Life
17:18
we don't need to blame God we need to walk in our Authority we need to take the word of God seriously and then we will be prosperous
17:25
successful we will not die but we will not become sick we will not be oppressed we will walk in Abundant Life we got to
17:31
take the word of God seriously and be serious about walking in our Authority it's as simple as that
17:40
Hallelujah so back to
17:47
back to your your your territory so when you become a believer
17:53
you immediately have all authority over the devil's schemes so all the ways he's trying to attack
17:58
your life outwardly now sometimes one has a demon or demons
18:05
before they become a Believer or after they become a Believer they've opened up doors or there is generational curses open
18:12
doors in the family that have passed on to you sometimes a Believer has demons
18:18
and in that case you might not have technically the level
18:24
of authority to cast them out of yourself
18:32
there are different levels of demonic powers in the spiritual realm as it says in Ephesians 6 12 it says that we are
18:39
not in a war of flesh and blood but there's principalities there's rulers there's forces in the spiritual realm
18:45
that's speaking of different levels principalities being the highest level Prince of a region
18:51
and so we see Acts 19 11 Paul was doing extraordinary miracles
18:57
the Bible says where even they're bringing handkerchiefs and aprons to his skin and touching on the sick and demon possessed
19:03
and the sick were being healed the demons are fleeing the fact that it said it said God was
19:09
doing extraordinary another translation says unusual that shows us that there
19:14
are different levels of authority and anointing that's the same thing by the way when you have anointing it also means you have authority
19:21
authority over demons authority over Darkness authority over sickness so that that reveals to us that there's
19:27
different levels there's different levels of authority
19:32
and anointing and we we see that anointing is rare we see that it's rare for demons to be
19:40
cast out in the body of Christ today God doesn't give the anointing to everybody
19:45
but he gives it to those who are humble childlike surrendered whom he can trust
19:51
that doesn't happen overnight it doesn't happen the moment you give your life to Jesus God can say Yep they're trustworthy he tests you to see if
19:58
you're trustworthy he tests Your Surrender he tests your humility he tests your child likeness he tests if
20:04
you're teachable and when you pass the test then he's seized he can trust you and then he
20:12
pours the anointing Hallelujah
20:17
and then once he pours the anointing it's not everything right at once but he you don't want to be destroyed by
20:24
that much power you know and it comes with a lot it comes with so much spiritual attack you have to be ready
20:30
and strong against the principalities attacks so God will will pour out more and more
20:38
and more as you become as you but more and more obedient and also according to what God's calling is on your life
20:44
because not everyone's called to be Apostle Paul an apostle Peter right
20:49
so the Bible says even Jesus says to the disciples you cast out demons the Bible
20:56
never actually says cast out demons out of yourself and it's because when you have a demon it's a literal chain of bondage
21:03
and it's only the anointing that destroys the yoke so you need this higher level of
21:09
anointing to cast out that demon to destroy that yoke that's why Jesus says to the disciples
21:15
you cast out demons out of people he doesn't say oh and by the way when
21:20
you get a demon cast a demon out of yourself you know we don't see that we have we have all authority over our
21:28
own spiritual life but I'm talking about the outward attacks but that's why it's so important that
21:33
the church has the power of God that's so important that God is restoring the acts church now so what we see in the
21:40
ACT church we'll see now today where when people need freedom and healing they can come to the church where high
21:46
level Authority anointing is and without much effort or struggle they can just be there in the presence the worship music
21:53
starts going and they start being freed that's what happened with Peter they
21:59
they put the sick and demon possessed near him in a proximity of him and he would pass by and his shadow would touch
22:05
touch the people and the demons would go and this they could be healed this shows that he had high level
22:11
anointing and Authority that there was no struggle but the power The Authority was so much stronger
22:17
that just being near him they had to obey that Authority
22:25
amen Hallelujah praise God
22:31
so I want to explain now how your territory
22:36
how what your territory is so first of all all of your territory in the
22:41
spiritual realm is first of all your own spiritual life for you to be constantly walking in
22:48
authority over every attack that comes your way also your Authority your territory
22:55
because by the way we have territories I want I want you to understand that our
23:01
territory isn't everywhere but there's certain places that's our territory that's our domain in the spiritual Realm
23:11
so your own personal life and then your households so if you have children
23:18
you're the spirit you have Spiritual Authority that's your territory in your house
23:23
that if your children are having attacks you you rebuke those attacks
23:29
now the kids could have demons in which case you should be coming to the church where the power of God is anyways
23:35
and they can just be freed simply just coming amen but you have authority over the the
23:41
like the outward attacks unless you yourself have grown in the anointing and
23:46
can cast the demons out of your children that happens too if you have grown in the anointing you can cast a demon out
23:52
of the child perhaps it depends on the level of demons the level of demonic power and your level of
23:58
anointing amen okay so from there now we're going to talk about Ministry
24:04
you are all called to minister you are all called to be vessels of God this
24:10
Great Commission that God's given all of us is preach the gospel heal the sick cast out demons raise the dead cleanse
24:16
the lepers that's not just for the spiritual Elites that's not for just the 12 original ones that's not just for me
24:25
or or just the the fivefold Ministers of today that's for every one of you heal
24:30
the sick cast out demons raise the Dead because you're all called to be a vessel of God's power we all have different
24:36
callings we all different callings like God has a specific level he he has for every person according to his perfect
24:42
purpose but you were all called to be a vessel of his power amen
24:49
so we all have different callings some are called to be actual faithful ministers where you'll have a church or
24:55
a Ministry and but some but many of you are called to to have your own territory
25:01
and minister in your territory in your life in your workplace in in in your home
25:08
where you're interacting with people in life the grocery store the public places
25:16
friends in your life amen
25:23
so I'm gonna first start with if you are a minister
25:28
if you're a faithful Minister like here here is a church where I'm the leader of as an apostle
25:36
and pasture this would be because God has given us Authority
25:41
right this would be my territory in the spiritual Realm
25:48
my domain that that's why demons trembled and
25:54
what's your name hon Christina that's why demons trembled there
26:00
in her because she came to my territory
26:10
Hallelujah just like Apostle Peter the reason why everyone was healed everyone had nothing
26:18
to do with one-on-one prayer had nothing to do with loud screaming demons go had
26:24
nothing to do with putting hands physical it had everything to do with the authority
26:29
that Peter was walking in and so this is how it is like as we
26:35
conduct church here this we want God's will to be done here we want demons to go here that's the Mandate here we want
26:42
the sick to be healed here we want God's will to be done we want
26:47
all Darkness to go and so because that's what I walk in
26:53
that's my heart that's my confession that's my Covenant with God
27:00
the demons and the devil know that so when I come here I don't even have to
27:06
say demons go but I am walking in that Authority this
27:12
is my territory where this these things must happen so when a person when you come here and
27:18
you have demons or you have sickness in your life you have strongholds in your life when
27:25
you come here to this church what you're doing is you're submitting everything in
27:30
you in the spiritual realm too you're submitting it all to the authority of Christ to God's will
27:37
you're you're making the choice to submit yourself well that's the action of you
27:43
coming to this church in any church is for you to say I want God's will to be done
27:51
it's an action of surrender to Jesus you're giving your free will to be here
27:59
for God to have his way that's what is going on in the spiritual Realm you think I'm just coming to church this
28:05
is what's happening in the spiritual realm that's why demons trembled immediately
28:11
but you also with your heart came that way you didn't come like a rock
28:18
where a rock can be in a stream but water doesn't penetrate because you can come that way but when
28:23
you come with that heart I want God's will to be done here I want to be free
28:29
you're that's the act of submitting yourself and the demons the sickness the darkness
28:35
has to submit has to obey it's this principle
28:42
it's my territory because God's giving me Authority so Christ's will God's will
28:48
must be done simple amen this is exciting to come to church right
28:53
we should never sit on that it's like I know God's was going to be done in my life today I'm coming to his territory
29:01
God's territory amen so that that's an example of me as a
29:08
minister that's that would apply to you if you have a church the same would apply if you are a guest speaker
29:13
somewhere uh that moment that you are speaking you would have the authority there and and it's very important we
29:19
understand Authority a lot of Christians don't understand Authority and so they're trying to pray for people and they're not seeing much results
29:25
because they're not understanding Authority but demons are going to respect you if you're not walking in Authority it's the authority
29:31
that makes them go so that's why there's this order that we have here where we don't have tons of
29:38
people praying all the time for other people because that's not how Authority works right
29:43
but it's like in the spiritual God's given me the the territory here and so
29:49
the demons will obey the most when we all respect that order
29:55
otherwise there's chaos otherwise is the kingdom divided which can't stand
30:00
right so here at this church you come here to submit to God's will for God's
30:06
will to be done in your life it's a place for you to receive to be healed to be delivered to be equipped to receive
30:11
impartation to be filled up to be equipped so you can go walk in
30:18
your territory in your domain and minister to others
30:24
and that's what's happening today you're being equipped to walk in that territory to know what your territory is and walk in it effectively this Authority
30:31
so for for you for you if you are not a minister for example
30:37
you are in a church for example your Authority would be if you have children
30:42
would be your home your Authority would be whenever people give you free will
30:49
their free will to minister to them it looks like different things so maybe
30:55
if you like happen to lead a Bible study or something or you're um praying like a prayer group or something
31:01
you would have authority that would be your territory there but besides that God has called you to
31:07
minister to people all throughout your life in the public in your workplace your friends
31:13
from other areas of life from the past you know you you know all these people in
31:19
life and you're going to come across many different people in your lives in the public place in the workplace amen
31:25
so God is calling you to minister to them not all of them though those that will give you their free will
31:35
God never forces himself on people he does not want us to force ourselves on people
31:42
this is very important because when you step outside of where you're supposed to your territory is opening the door to
31:49
the devil it's opening a door to attacks you have to respect people's free will
31:57
so this is this is what we should be doing we should be the light the greatest light we can be
32:03
we should be full of God's love everywhere we go oozing his love shining
32:09
the brightest we can we're called to be the city on a hill so we are called to be so bright so
32:17
enticing so full of love that we catch people's attention we
32:24
catch people's attention with how we treat them with kindness when they didn't deserve it we catch people's attention with how we
32:31
how we treated someone they observed wow you you that person was mean to you but you were kind back
32:36
we catch people's attention when we are full of Peace when they know what's going on in our life and we should be
32:42
full of anxiety and depression we catch people's attention when we smile at them always
32:48
we catch people's attention this is being the light of the world and when you're truly a light of the
32:55
world people can't help but be attracted God is pursuing them and one of the big
33:01
ways he pursues people is through you God's pursuing them and people are
33:06
feeling that tug and So eventually somebody you're gonna catch a fish
33:13
eventually somebody's gonna come up to you and submit themselves to your territory
33:20
like somebody's gonna come up to this is what it looks like somebody's going to come up to you and engage in a conversation with you
33:26
and be like what is it about you why do you have so much peace
33:31
I'm filled with anxiety all the time people feel in their heart they want to open up to you because they feel loved they feel safe they feel Jesus they
33:38
don't know what it is yet so they start to open up to you
33:44
and you continue to love on them you continue to love on them and then once
33:49
they start to open up to you they get to the point where they're even saying I need help and you can start to tell them
33:56
about God you can start to tell them your testimony how God freed you how God wants to free them
34:01
and then you can even say I could pray for you and God God could free you right now do you want that or they might ask
34:08
you could you pray for me that is your territory
34:15
they have just stepped into your territory your domain
34:21
where you truly have authority that's how you can know where your
34:27
territory is and that's the place where you can Minister them to them you can command demons to go you can
34:34
command sickness to go you can God can release prophetic words to you
34:40
amen that's your territory but it's important
34:46
to not step out of your territory I know we can get very zealous like people need you
34:51
but we have to be very careful to not step out of our territory because we open ourselves up to demonic attacks
35:00
this is why we're called what we should be doing is loving people and being the light
35:05
rather than going down to the homeless Street and say get out of her
35:14
what happened to their free will though and I know it's hard sometimes because sometimes people aren't right in their
35:20
mind but they it's still free will that's a good time when someone should
35:26
invite them to church and see if they'll come because now they're submitting themselves
35:32
amen like on an airplane there's I fly every week and there's
35:39
demons everywhere you know but I I cannot go
35:47
oh my command every demon on this plane and every person to leave now
35:55
I can't do that it's not my territory there
36:03
people have free will some people on that plane want to serve the devil
36:09
I can't force them some people want to be atheists want to worship other gods I can't force them but I can be the light
36:16
I can be so kind and friendly to everybody who comes my way the flight attendants the people on the plane the people
36:22
sitting next to me I can smile you know and they could they might feel
36:30
they want to ask me something strike up a conversation you know and that can lead to me blessing them they could who
36:36
knows it couldn't let lead to me praying for them and it casts no demon on the plane Maybe
36:42
but we need to be in our territory or else and this is a warning I'm saying it's opening up yourself up to demonic
36:48
attacks amen Hallelujah
36:55
so um and that's why I say that's why it's
37:01
important here at like Fievel church that we have this order because if you're stepping out of your territory and stepping into another uh servant of
37:08
Christ's territory it's it's opening up doors to Demons because you're going out of
37:14
the order amen
37:19
so I also now want to talk about the fact that we're learning about territory
37:25
today I want to talk about the fact that that there is the devil's territory
37:32
because people because the devil's allowed to do things right we know this
37:38
he's allowed in this Earth today and so this is how there's demons everywhere
37:43
it's because the devil's doing works it's because he has servants he has witches and warlocks putting curses and
37:49
sending demons to people so um
37:57
the devil's territory is where his work is carried out like his work is being carried out and
38:04
the devil's territory would be where his true servants his witches his
38:10
warlocked are all United I mean they're all serving the devil and they're all
38:15
doing his work that's their all of their free will
38:22
so we are not called to go into the devil's territory
38:28
we are called to be separate set apart we are called to be light and not mixed
38:34
with Darkness amen um it says in first thessonians 5 5 you
38:40
are all sons of Light and Sons of the day or daughters you are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us
38:46
not sleep as others do but let us be watching be and be sober for those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk or drunk at night
38:52
you are a sense of light and day and so we need to use wisdom uh like really
38:57
knowing where our territory is where we are effective for the kingdom because sometimes sometimes we can feel
39:03
like I'm just gonna go into this darkness and be the light but in reality you're going into the devil's territory
39:11
where every person in the devil's territory there it's their free will to serve the devil
39:17
does that make sense where you can be so effective in your
39:23
actual territory your territory is actually really big I mean your territory not just as where you can
39:28
minister to people and cast out demons and heal the sick but also I should say the place your Hill where
39:35
you're the light your Hill to be the light to draw people in
39:40
for you to minister to them or for someone else to minister them for them to be ministered too you know we're called to just be the light and then let
39:47
God do his work whether it's us guessing he was out or somebody else but we're called our main
39:53
our main focus should be to be the light to be just bringing the fish in
39:59
amen and so your pla your place where where the city on a hill so your Hill plays to be the light
40:07
is big it's so big but it should be like this neutral space
40:13
like here we are in a neutral park space we are not in a masonic temple but we are in
40:20
you know or we're not in a Satan's Satanist
40:26
um building but we are in a neutral space where we can be a light for people who have free
40:31
will some people walk by here they're going to get their Halloween outfits
40:39
that's their free will some people here they're going on their way to go to the psychic or to to be a psychic that's
40:46
their free will some people they they feel something when they pass
40:51
by here and God's been pursuing them but because we are spreading our light
40:56
in our territory where anybody can be reached
41:02
they are attracted and they come and they receive Jesus amen
41:07
so your place to shine is it should be this place this of this
41:15
like neutral ground like social media you can put your post out there you can be sharing testimonies of what God's
41:21
been doing here for example share your testimony you're sharing it out but you're letting people have free will
41:28
you're not forcing it you're sharing it you know you talk about it with people
41:33
you talk about your testimonies with people at work whatever you don't force it but you talk freely when they're open
41:39
to it there's so many places for you to shine to be effective and to be in a place of
41:45
spiritual safety protect it because when you're in your territory is
41:51
when you're protected by God but like
41:58
psychics for example I'm not gonna knock on the door of a psychic and say like
42:05
you need Freedom I'd like to cast demons out of you you know
42:12
it's it's the psychics free will and the psychic is actively serving the
42:18
devil and that's technically the devil's territory there when people go to psychics psychics are
42:25
putting demons in them when people are going to Witch Doctors they're putting demons in them they're
42:32
sending demons to them for psychics it's a demon telling them things that they know your spirit they follow the person
42:39
they know things about the person's life that's how the psychic gets their powers
42:44
demonic demon giving them the powers demon giving them insight and then they
42:50
send the demons to the people so when you go to a psychic when you go to Witch Doctor that's you entering
42:56
Devil's territory that's why you hear so many testimonies
43:01
I mean so many people come and renounce they go to a witch doctor go into a
43:06
Healer that wasn't of Jesus um Santeria um psychic it's like every
43:13
time they get demons and they're Believers many times but it's because they stepped into Devil's
43:19
territory we can't blame God we have free will when we step into Devil's
43:25
territory it's his territory he can do works
43:31
there it's the same principles opening a door many times opening the door is stepping
43:38
into his territory like there's many ways we could not walk
43:43
in wisdom we could be like I'm gonna watch a horror movie and just pray over everyone who who's watching it but they
43:50
never receive a demon you've actually stepped into the devil's territory as you're watching and you're
43:56
allowing him to put demons of fear in you but that principle of doing that with a
44:01
horror movie that sometimes ways that Christians are walking in wisdom they're being like I want to bring the light
44:06
there but they're actually going to the devil's territory where people have free will to serve the devil there
44:13
so that's not your territory to go there amen we have to be separate from there
44:19
we stay away from that and those people that are this could also include um going to dark parties
44:25
like Halloween parties or the clubs or just parties where it's
44:32
Darkness you don't have to go there to minister those same people that are that are
44:38
going to those things they're also going to grocery stores they're also passing by you in the street
44:44
be the light there be separate be set apart
44:52
amen Hallelujah um so the the places where the devil's
44:58
territory are also this is why it's not good to take part in Halloween because like the day came from the Devil the
45:06
devil's The Source behind it he's the spirit behind it so it becomes like his territory
45:12
everything's influenced by him the the the ghosts the decorations of the skeletons and the witches and it's all
45:19
influenced by him all influence there so there is real uh
45:26
territory there when you engage in that
45:31
you're entering unsafe territory
45:37
it's like sometimes I mean sometimes something harm nothing would happen but sometimes other times a demon of anxiety
45:44
could come into a child for example you know I was Nanny and a boy we were driving
45:49
down this was when I was the first year in the ministry I was still working part-time we were driving down Sunset Boulevard he sees a scary movie uh
45:56
billboard it was a sequel to a movie he had seen as a child when he went into
46:01
his or just a scene he saw walking into his parents room they were watching it but we're driving by the billboard he's
46:07
freaking out he's 12 years old like almost a teenager and he's covering his eyes freaking out saying tell me
46:13
board and I asked him what happened and that's what he said so when you're watching a horror movie
46:19
when you're when you're going to a place where there is fear death
46:25
this is Devil's territory this is a place where he can you're giving your free will to go into
46:31
Devil's territory where he could do things where he could put demons where he could bring fear Darkness anxiety death
46:40
um Hallelujah uh
46:48
there was a horrible tragedy that happened yesterday in Seattle South Korea a hundred and something people more than
46:55
a hundred people died of a stampede
47:00
of how it was a huge Halloween celebration
47:05
where people traveled from Australia Dubai so many different nations it's
47:11
just like it's like the biggest Halloween celebration in Asia one of the biggest ones
47:17
so they're all going there to celebrate and they ended up get the alleys are narrow and they ended up getting too
47:23
many people there and so people suffocated they were trampled on
47:29
and so this happened yesterday um and
47:36
I pray I I speak blessing and peace and comfort of God to every one of those the family
47:42
members of those they were in their 20s and teens with the people the ages and I and I pray God would open
47:50
their eyes and they'd receive Jesus their family members and be comforted by him
47:55
but yesterday seeing that it reminded me so much of um this trap was it Travis Scott concert in
48:03
Houston Texas it's like the same kind of thing happened like last year I think about
48:08
almost exactly a year ago or so and there it was such a demonic concert like
48:16
I happened to see when I was looking at the news about it what happened they showed images and I'd never seen such a
48:22
demonic themes I mean most secular singers are pretty in the
48:28
darkness you know a lot of them are but not so blatantly dark images as this
48:34
I've never seen such dark images that look like worshiping the devil basically this is one of the biggest pop artists
48:41
and um a very similar thing happened where all of a sudden there's just so many people
48:48
and they just started to rush people started to just like try to rush the stage get closer and I don't know the
48:53
number I forget but several people died young people once again several people died from that
48:59
and um there's not it's not a coincidence
49:05
that these tragedies that you even scratch your head and you're like how could that even happen that doesn't even like make sense
49:11
there's not a coincidence why we see things like this happening why we see these kinds of tragic deaths
49:17
in these scenarios things that are so dark like this it's
49:24
Devil's territory like territory of the devil
49:29
where you're opening yourself up to receive his his Works upon your life
49:38
you know there's no coincidence it was a Halloween festival a Halloween celebration you know
49:45
so um
49:51
it's important for us to know that the the spiritual realm the Demonic spiritual realm it's real
49:57
like witches are real they are doing Works they have they they the the devil
50:04
tells these witches to they need to make um sacrifices like human sacrifices
50:10
and it's all in the spiritual realm you know it's all in the spiritual Realm they they they literally allow there to
50:17
be sacrifices of people allow people to die at maybe their events or they allow
50:24
things to happen um and so this is why it's so important
50:29
to know like don't play around with this don't step into the devil's territory
50:35
there's not the protection of God there
50:40
and we don't blame God we have free will the people in the world because of these
50:47
tragedies because of because of what happened yesterday and what happened at the Travis Scott concert and because of
50:54
even like covet and other things that happen tragedies people in the world
51:00
they live in fear they live being like something bad could
51:05
happen to me because it just happens randomly to people I could just die because it just happened so just they live in this fear
51:15
we as children of God do not live in fear
51:20
because our spiritual eyes are open and we know that we have the protection
51:26
of God when we follow his commands when we walk
51:32
in our Authority take it seriously when we don't sleep spiritually we stay away
51:39
from the things of Darkness we don't mess around that don't give a tiny photo to the devil
51:46
but we're serious about our surrender to Jesus we're serious about pleasing him
51:51
every day of Our Lives when you do that you are in God's hands
52:02
in God's hands where you are protected fully you are protected more than a vaccine
52:08
than a mass can protect you more than than anything on this Earth
52:16
could protect you Supernatural protection and we don't
52:22
live in fear because not only are we in God's protection but we know that we're here for a reason
52:28
that God put us on this Earth for a reason we'd love to go to heaven right now we'd probably all love to do that right in a
52:34
second but we know that God put us here for a reason
52:40
for purpose we have an assignment we have an assignment to reach the law
52:46
so they don't go to hell and to lead them to Jesus that's our assignment God wants us here
52:53
or he would have created us to live in heaven with him he wants us here so his people can be
52:59
saved he wants us here he wants all of us to live a long life
53:05
serving him so we can have no fear we can live confidently
53:12
knowing there's nothing to fear God wants to hear nothing bad's gonna happen to me
53:19
anything that comes my way will only be God refining me in the fire to make me better
53:26
here every day we can live in this peace and joy
53:32
and not worried like am I opening a door you've come here you're equipped your
53:39
eyes are opened up so you know not to step in the devil's territory you know what the devil's territory is
53:44
you say no amen hallelujah
53:50
hallelujah praise God praise God our God is so good amen
53:57
he's really given us Abundant Life protection peace Joy healing Freedom this is the truth thank you Jesus stand
54:05
to your feet
