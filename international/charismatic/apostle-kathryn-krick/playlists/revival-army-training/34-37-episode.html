I've been doing a series on my book The Secret of the
0:05
anointing accessing the power of God to walk in Miracles what I started to teach
0:12
was how to cast out demons and heal the sick once you have received the
0:18
anointing from God which is the most important part of being able to cast out
0:24
demons and Healing The Sick because it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke once you have received the anointing
0:30
what do you do with it because you can have the anointing and you could you could not use it the
0:37
right way how God wants you could be you could be casting out demons in the old win skin way you could be doing it in a
0:45
way that's not effective in a way that is outside of God's order and his
0:51
principles so it's so important that you you're not just looking for for God to
0:57
fill you with anointing but but that you are making sure you're using the anointing effectively how God wants amen
1:06
I began teaching okay now once you have the anointing how to cast out demons and
1:11
heal the sick today we're going to it's part two we're going to continue learning being equipped how to cast out
1:19
demons and heal the sick
1:27
amen so a little recap from last week the first step is to follow the Holy
1:35
Spirit to not just be so zealous and focus like I want to cast out demons or
1:41
to see someone and be like I must cast a demon out of you but we have to follow the Holy Spirit um we can't be
1:49
mechanical like a robot we have to be listening to the holy spirit's voice of
1:55
if it's time to cast out the demon is it our place to cast out the demon right
2:01
now um it and then also we have to make sure we're not
2:07
using our gifts wrongly like when the Holy Spirit wants you to to use one of
2:13
his gifts but you are more excited about another gift of the Holy Spirit but God
2:19
doesn't want you to use that right now he wants he wants you to focus on Deliverance for example um instead of
2:25
maybe prophesying someone's future you know you have to be be uh obedient to
2:31
the Holy Spirit and really really having the fear of God like this is a this is
2:37
this is the work of God that I'm doing not me casting out a demon but I'm being
2:42
a vessel of the holy spirit so this is God's job this is God's work I better
2:47
make sure that he's able to do all he wants through me I don't get in the way
2:53
amen and then I also taught that number two the this second step
3:00
is that you must operate in the principles and laws of the spiritual
3:05
realm because God is a god of order and he has certain
3:11
principles we can't just be chaotic and do whatever or or go by our feelings and
3:18
however we think but we must go by his word his principles his spiritual laws
3:24
are in his word when we have the Holy Spirit to give us real Revelation from
3:31
the word and we have anointed teaching to open our eyes to help us bring
3:38
understanding of what the word of God is saying bring more many times the word of
3:43
God says this it's like one sentence right but there's so much more than that
3:49
one sentence that the holy spirit will speak bringing understanding and more
3:55
meaning amen and so these these principles that we must operate in are
4:01
the principle is the principle of authority that we are casting out demons
4:08
by walking in our Authority that's what makes demons go so we better not be doing things that have nothing to do
4:15
with walking in Authority like raising our voice thinking that the level of the voice is
4:23
what's going to make the demon go no it's Authority the president of the United States can whisper something or
4:28
yell it it will happen regardless the law or what the whatever you know um and uh we we you can get
4:38
distracted sometimes when you're not operating in the principle of authority you can get distracted with other
4:43
methods trying other things to try to get the demon to go putting objects on people and putting your hands and
4:51
physical effort into it pushing them down or something trying to beat the demon out of somebody or
4:57
something there's all sorts of crazy things things that people might do when
5:02
they are not walking in this revelation of the principle of
5:07
authority amen we also have to walk in the principle of territory meaning it's
5:17
your territory isn't the whole world but your territory where you have domain to
5:23
walk in the authority over other people's life like casting demons out of other people is a specific Place specific
5:32
places for example I can't just decide
5:37
after church today you know what I know that there's so many demon oppressed people in a lukewarm church over there
5:43
um I'm going to go in there I'm going to disturb the service and say excuse me
5:49
the Lord told me I need to come and take over the service and set free these people in
5:54
here that'd be awesome but it's not in the principle of territory that's not my
6:00
territory amen so we have to make sure we're operating in our the principle of territory and also the principle of Free
6:09
Will meaning you can see someone that you know needs Deliverance but they
6:15
still have free will so you can't force Deliverance upon them
6:21
amen so that's a recap so those were the two big uh steps the two first steps
6:28
that I taught um and then this this the last major step third step of casting out demons
6:36
is using the using the spiritual keys
6:42
that God has given us that unlocks Deliverance that unlocks people to
6:47
receive Deliverance unlocks people out of the chains of bondage so to use these keys
6:54
that God has given us like the Keys of the Kingdom given to Peter
7:00
the keys are the meaning of that is revelation revelation of
7:06
how demons will be released from a person what's making them to stay and
7:14
how do we get them to to be unraveled and the chains be broken
7:21
amen so the first key I'm going to share right now there are first of all there
7:28
are many different keys that unlock complete deliverance
7:35
and for some cases the person may only need one key others may need two others
7:41
may need three it depends just on the case that's why we have to be following
7:47
the Holy Spirit and so as I'm teaching you now how to cast out demons it's so
7:52
important that you're always remembering we must follow the holy spirit this shouldn't be like step one
7:58
step two step three and it's just something a repetitive thing religious thing that you just do
8:04
every time there's not a a certain way it's going to be every time it will be
8:11
different because in this spiritual realm these different demonic
8:17
oppressions they're different that some some people have one chain others have two chains others have three chains some
8:23
have three chains but they're all tangled some have three chains that that are really heavy you know some someone
8:29
can have a principality and then a low-level demon someone can have a a a deep
8:35
Covenant that was made over their life which makes the de the the Demonic oppression stronger it's all different
8:43
according to each person so that's why we have to follow the leading of the holy spirit
8:49
amen hallelujah so the first
8:58
key is the first key that that unlocks Deliverance which is the key that most
9:06
people need to have is
9:11
faith faith that Jesus can deliver or heal you a person must have faith a
9:20
person must come to Jesus in faith I believe Jesus wants to and can deliver
9:26
and heal me it says in in Mark 5:25 a woman in the
9:34
crowd has suffered for 12 years with constant bleeding she had suffered a great deal from many doctors and over
9:40
the years she had spent everything she had to pay them but she had gotten no better in fact she had gotten worse she
9:47
had heard about Jesus so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his Rob for she thought to herself if I
9:54
can just touch his robe I will be healed immediately the bleeding beding stopped
9:59
and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition Jesus realized at once that
10:06
healing power had gone out from him so he turned around in the crowd and asked
10:12
who touched my robe his disciples said to him look at this crowd pressing around you how can you ask who touched
10:19
me but he kept on looking around to see who had done it then the frightened woman trembling at the realization of
10:25
what had happened to her came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done and he said to her
10:33
daughter your faith has made you well go in peace your suffering is
10:43
[Applause] over Hallelujah so this woman had faith that
10:52
Jesus wanted to heal her and that he would heal
10:57
her and and not just that but she positioned herself to receive she she
11:04
positioned herself where the anointing was
11:10
flowing in today's time that action of grabbing the Hem of Jesus's garment
11:18
today the action of that is positioning yourself where the anointing of Jesus is
11:23
Flowing where it is being released today Jesus moves through vessels he says said
11:29
to his disciples and to us today I give you all authority you will
11:35
do the works that I did and greater you heal the sick cast out
11:43
demons that's what he said to his disciples which is what he says to us now so now Jesus in power his anointing
11:51
moves through vessles not everyone he wants to move through every believer but as I've been
12:00
teaching the the majority of this Series has been teaching how to receive the
12:06
anointing you must have a heart that God can trust you must be humble pure
12:12
childlike and surrendered and then God will pour out the anointing in your life
12:18
and so today to to grab the Hem of Jesus's robe that's like coming to
12:25
church where God's power is that's what you are doing today but you have to you have to reach out
12:32
you can't she could have just stood there and watched him go by but she reached out in faith so
12:41
position yourself where the anointing is but don't just position yourself reach
12:46
out in faith believe I'm going to receive
12:52
Deliverance today I'm going to receive healing today and that's the action of touching
12:58
his reaching out and touching the Hem of His robe pulling on the
13:03
anointing so you coming to church today that's you touching reaching out and touching the H of Jesus's robe it's also
13:10
you watching online you're positioning yourself where the anointing is
13:16
flowing and um now when we're talking about for you when it's time for you to
13:22
cast out demons this is the the one the big key
13:28
that is needed sometimes it's the only key that is needed that unlocks the deliverance from
13:34
the person is faith that Jesus can and
13:39
wants to deliver and heal them number one and also the part two of this first
13:45
key is positioning themselves where the anointing is in that case would be you
13:53
your prayer you executing your authority over over that demon in their
14:02
life so when a person opens up to you with free will they're in your territory
14:08
it's time God is leading you to cast a demon out of this person and and they are now believing
14:16
they're speaking maybe yes I want Jesus to deliver me like what you've testified about I want Jesus to do that for me and
14:24
I I believe it or they don't even have to say I believe it but holy spirit will show you their faith is there and now it
14:31
is time to walk in your Authority and cast The Demon
14:37
out and so for some people that's the only key that is
14:43
needed faith not faith that God exists but specifically faith that by his
14:49
stripes we are healed that this healing and deliverance is my inheritance as a
14:55
child of God it's already mine but now I need to receive it so you you're having
15:01
faith that it's time to receive now you're having faith that it's already yours and it's time to receive and God's
15:07
going to do it the power of God's going to move and it's time it's receiving
15:13
time that kind of faith that the right kind of Faith
15:20
amen hallelujah so I know we're going to go on other Keys now but it's not it
15:26
shouldn't be like a a religious ritual what do you want to renounce
15:32
sometimes that that key isn't needed sometimes it's all that's why
15:38
sometimes you'll see when I pray for people sometimes there isn't any renouncing but they're set
15:44
free it's because that key wasn't needed it will do no harm to renounce renouncing is great always but we just
15:50
have to make sure we're not getting into a religious ritual of things however I will say something
15:58
something else that's important for you to know um well first of all I do want to
16:06
mention the second the the second key is renouncing the second key is renouncing
16:11
areas of bondage and open doors and Covenants and I'm going to teach more about that in just a second but I first
16:18
want to say that um renouncing is so powerful renouncing
16:25
is using your Authority in Christ the power of life that's in your
16:31
tongue and you are saying I don't want this bondage
16:37
anymore when you say when a person or you says I renounce anxiety I renounce
16:42
depression I renounce witchcraft I renounce insomnia I renounce this sickness whatever it is you saying I
16:49
don't accept this bondage in my life anymore the truth of the matter is is that when you say I have anxiety I have
16:55
anxiety I have this sickness and that's all you're doing is you're saying you have it you are accepting it you are
17:02
accepting the devil's portion in your life this is the spiritual reality what we should be doing is
17:09
rejecting diagnosis you know you don't have to
17:14
feel paranoid like you can't repeat what the doctor said you can say the doctor says I have this but I am healed by
17:20
Jesus's Stripes I don't receive that diagnosis I reject I re reject that I
17:30
any kind of sickness that's in my body must get out it cannot stay because I am healed this is my inheritance from
17:37
Jesus and so if someone asks you oh what did the doctor say you can say the truth you can say what the doctor said but
17:44
just don't stop there you know don't don't don't take the action of accepting it in your
17:49
heart a and doing nothing about it this this is war time now when you
17:57
receive diagn noes or when something is going on in your body or your mind something's happening anxiety depression
18:05
um insomnia sickness whatever this attack is do not be like the world and
18:11
just say oh great this is my portion I have this now I got to find the worldly uh fix for this no it's war time be
18:25
spiritual yes go in the spirit the Bible says submit to God resist the devil and
18:31
he must flee so submit to God by going in the spirit it's war time like submit
18:38
to God's word God says that we are in a spiritual war we have to be aware of the devil who's roaring around like a lion
18:45
seeking whom we can devour it said the Bible says that we need to put on the full armor of God the the Bible says
18:52
that we need to take our authority over the devil so the Bible says all of these action words about us being a warrior in
19:00
Christ and being active and walking in Authority that's
19:06
the word of God it's all over the word of God how it's instructing us to take action in the spirit to not just sit
19:12
there so this is a big meaning of submit to
19:18
God the word is the the word is God submit to the
19:24
word the word saying to resist the devil I'm going to resist the lies of the
19:29
devil the word says by his stripes I am healed the word says that I should be
19:35
taking walking in my authority over the devil so submit to God follow his
19:41
instructions action time resist the devil resist these attacks these lies
19:47
these ways the devil's trying to say you have this no you don't have it until you accept it reject it you'll be amazed
19:54
it'll go away you'll see you'll see try it greater is he that is in you than he
20:00
that is in the world put God to the test in you as you walk in your Authority and
20:05
you see the power of God moved through you as you walk in authority and the devil defeated every
20:12
time [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah so a lot of people
20:21
have been accepting the devil's portion and that's what's brought the
20:27
bondage is that that's been the open door I mean that can be the open door sometimes simply accepting a diagnosis
20:34
and not doing not going in the spirit and rejecting it and and and saying by
20:39
his stripes I'm Healed I believe this that God will heal me so sometimes not
20:45
doing that and just being Idol and accepting what was said that what the
20:52
devil wants you to have the portion that's the open door so so when you started having those
20:57
symptoms you didn't you didn't have the sickness yet you didn't have the demon
21:03
yet but once you accepted them and didn't reject
21:09
them it now the door was open and now the demon has come in or the infirmity
21:15
has come in and so now you do have that now you you didn't need Deliverance before you just needed to walk in your
21:21
Authority and reject the devil and he would flee no weapon formed against you will prosper if you resist the devil then he will flee but now the weapon has
21:29
prospered because you allowed it so now you need Deliverance you need healing you need
21:36
the anointing to destroy the Yoke and you will be free but so so many times if
21:41
someone has accepted the devil's portion in their life which is most people that have bondage especially because they
21:48
have not gotten this kind of equipping this kind of equipping is rare in the body of Christ which this stuff is like
21:54
milk that I'm teaching you spiritual milk this is the basics kindergarteners four-year-olds three-year-olds should
22:00
even be doing this yeah this is basics of being a
22:05
child of God and walking in Authority children can be victorious
22:11
over the devil absolutely Hallelujah so many people
22:16
haven't had this equipping so they really have accepted that bondage and so when you have when you've never rejected
22:22
the devil renouncing is so important you need to say I didn't reject this before but I'm re in it
22:29
now I renounce this anxiety this is not my portion I renounce this sickness this
22:36
is not my portion by his stripes I am healed I am free God has given me a
22:42
perfect peace A sound mind not fear or anxiety so I renounce this
22:49
anxiety so that's it's powerful when one renounces that's what's happening in the spiritual realm is you're rejecting the
22:56
devil and it's very important especially when you haven't really rejected the devil before amen so um what I wanted to say
23:07
was when when whenever someone renounces it is making the grip of the devil
23:14
demons loosen so what happens many times is a a
23:19
person will renounce they will renounce and all of a sudden you'll start seeing um demons
23:26
leave them because they were where the anointing is
23:31
and that was all that was needed they renounced that was the key they were where the anointing is they had Faith
23:37
boom there didn't even need to be a declaration yet because the authority was already being
23:43
executed by The Vessel of God just ministering and walking in their Authority
23:49
hallelujah praise God back to the first key about faith I just wanted to rewind
23:55
a little bit because I know I started getting to renouncing but with faith it really just depends like
24:01
sometimes the faith has to really be ripe sometimes you need to desire and
24:07
want your freedom sometimes you need to really be surrendered to
24:13
Jesus and really Desiring his inheritance of freedom and that's the
24:20
faith that's required sometimes that's the key like
24:26
it must be that rpe Faith one can have other doors open up
24:32
and they're not really serious about their freedom but they have faith that God can deliver them but you you need to
24:37
have this ripe Faith but but then there can be different cases you you you can't you
24:44
can't take everything though like it must be this way if you don't have faith you're not going to get delivered
24:50
because there's exceptions sometimes holy spirit moves in all sorts of ways
24:55
generally the faith is very important important The Ripe faith is important but I remember one time when
25:02
we had Church in the park there was this mother who brought her teenage son he
25:08
didn't want to come to the church he wanted to stay dep he was depressed and
25:13
just stay in his room but she made him come and he started
25:19
manifesting when he got there and that Faith sparked up in his heart
25:26
once he got there because God's presence was there and he ended up being set free
25:33
he ended up being healed he took his glasses off and he could see after his deliverance and he had this Encounter
25:39
With Jesus where he spoke to Jesus and saw Jesus and he shared in a
25:44
testimony like scripture he was speaking like he wasn't in the word before you could tell like he really had this
25:52
Encounter With Jesus but you know he came to the church seemingly not really having Faith you
25:59
know so God can do a lot in a short amount of time and God can also do a lot
26:05
with a mustard seed amen so sometimes the faith needs
26:10
to be ripe and and it doesn't mean you need to wait for your feelings to catch
26:15
up I do not mean that faith is not in the feelings but faith is about action and
26:21
choice so what looks like faith is surrender to God is believing his word
26:28
not feeling his word is true but choosing to believe his word and what he says and so the devil
26:36
can be speaking all sorts of lies to you you know like oh this won't happen you won't be delivered but you reject them
26:43
and you speak the truth and you speak I believe I will be healed even if you don't feel like it but you speak it
26:50
that's what God counts as Faith so you can all have faith right now you don't
26:55
need to wait for your faith to be ripe it's up to you
27:04
Hallelujah so now back on to renouncing so renouncing is a big key um to be free
27:13
it says in uh it says in Acts
27:19
19:18 that many of those who would become Believers were coming confessing and disclosing their former sinful
27:25
practices so this was in the acts church so it says many people coming to the
27:32
church uh who had become believers they were believers they were confessing and
27:38
disclosing their former sinful practices so this wasn't just like oh I
27:45
want to get this off my chest this wasn't just doing it in a religious
27:51
way like the word says we should confess our sins to one another so I'm doing this they were renouncing
27:59
they were getting free this was happening so renouncing is in the word
28:04
of God it's confessing the formal sinful practices
28:09
publicly and the very next scripture it says many of those who had practiced
28:16
magical Arts collected their books and throwing book after book on the pile began burning them in front of
28:22
everyone so the very next sentence is is also Al a form of um another key
28:30
to be free for some people is getting rid of objects that have witchcraft attached to
28:37
them where demons can literally be attached to some uh some um
28:42
objects and so this really shows us that that what was happening in this scripture here was Freedom was
28:49
Deliverance it wasn't just like oh yes I'm just getting rid of these things I'm confessing my sins I'm getting rid of
28:55
these things because I'm a Believer now no they were renouncing they were getting free they were th detaching
29:02
themselves from these demonic objects and they were getting free
29:07
Hallelujah um and it says in Ephesians 4:27 do not give the
29:14
devil a foothold so the meaning of this is this
29:20
is speaking to Believers don't give the devil a foothold because when you give him a
29:26
foothold you are opening up a door where a demon can come in and have legal
29:32
access and bring oppression people think Christians can't
29:37
have demons well why is this saying to believers do not give the devil a
29:43
foothold if you do give the devil a foothold that means you're opening up the door that means he can come in
29:52
right so this is instruction keep door shut to the devil if you don't there
29:57
there will be consequences you can be a believer and have demons then is what the scripture is saying
30:07
amen so demonic oppression in general it only comes when there is a
30:14
foothold when a door has been opened
30:21
so to make the demon go sometimes when the anointing is is powerful all that's
30:27
needed is that person had to have faith and the authority executed they're
30:33
free but other times the the oppression is more
30:38
complex and how it isn't complex is that demons have gotten legal access to be
30:45
there and stay there and so what we need to do is is
30:50
figure out by the by the wisdom the leading of the Holy
30:56
Spirit what keys unlock This legal
31:01
access to like them to be free them to not have demons to not have this legal access anymore them to not allowed to
31:08
legally stay there anymore now obviously demons do have legal access
31:15
among many Christians because so many Christians have addiction depression anxiety if we took a poll of all the
31:21
Christians in the world you know who who has either depression anxiety um infirmity generation
31:27
problems that keep recurring um panic attacks insomnia demonic dreams recurring um rage addiction
31:36
Etc is probably most would have at least one of them many of them have several of
31:43
them so obviously demons do have legal access in people even in Believers even
31:49
when they say I'm G I believe in Jesus otherwise every single believer in
31:54
this whole world would not have addiction or depression orx xiety or all these things are
31:59
demons right so yes they have legal access that's why they're still able to stay there even though you're a Believer
32:06
so we need to find out what this legal access is that they have and find this
32:11
key that makes the legal access be gone from them and they have to go they're forced to go by the rules of the kingdom
32:19
of God so um renouncing many times releases
32:26
that legal access because you have really accepted this demonic oppression the legal access is
32:33
that it's like the devil's like will you want me here you invited me in and you keep telling me to be
32:39
here by continuing to confess the oppression over and over again and by
32:44
not walking in your Authority and rejecting the devil the devil's like I have legal access you invited me here
32:50
just like Eve and Adam and Eve gave the keys to the devil it was their choice right so
33:00
renouncing when when you're saying nope I don't want you here I know I invited
33:06
you in before I allowed you in before but I don't want you here anymore I'm using my authority in Christ get out I
33:13
reject you I reject this in Jesus name
33:19
Hallelujah and many times that's the that's when the demons lose their legal access oh they use the power of life
33:28
and walked in their Authority and now I have to go is what the demons what's it's like for the demons right so
33:39
um I want to go over uh the different
33:44
kinds of uh doors that can be different the different kinds of of doors that are
33:51
opened when demons have come and have legal rights so the first one is when
33:57
when the person themselves opens up the door themselves which is what I've been
34:02
talking about this happens by them agreeing with diagnosis diagnoses or and not rejecting
34:10
it or agreeing with uh the the lies of the devil coming at
34:17
them and not rejecting this also can come by through sin when a person
34:24
sins uh does drugs gets drunk sleeps
34:30
around uh speaking words of death sinning in all various ways that
34:38
opens up a door by disobeying God's commands that's opening up a door that's
34:45
saying it's like it's like saying you're not really a True Believer it's like
34:50
saying I'm not valuing God's word I'm going I'm
34:56
doing what the devil wants me to do devil wants you to get drunk devil wants you to do drugs devil wants you to sleep
35:01
around devil wants you to curse people devil wants you to to lie to cheat to
35:07
steal to kill to hurt people devil wants you to do these things so when you're doing
35:13
these things you're saying okay devil I'll do these things so in the spiritual
35:18
realm it's like you're making him your master even if you're going to church and you say Jesus is Lord but your
35:24
actions are showing that he is your master unless in at least part of your
35:30
life so over here even though it's just part of your life devil is your master so devil for
35:37
sure can come in and bring
35:42
oppression another way that one can open up a door is by doing witchcraft by
35:48
going to a psychic that's that's inviting demonic powers in your life by
35:55
going to a psychic you're saying I open myself up I give a foothold for the
36:00
devil to come and give a demonic insight to me a demonic prophetic a false
36:08
prophetic but demonic insight to to give it to me and when you
36:14
do that the doors open for the devil to come more demons to come more same with doing anything with
36:21
witchcraft playing with Ouija boards playing with tarot cards you are opening
36:26
yourself up up to demonic Powers oh giving the foothold to the devil to come
36:32
in that way also believing that crystals will heal you not Jesus will heal you
36:37
but crystals that they have the supernatural power to heal you that is also accessing
36:45
witchcraft opening up the door to Witchcraft powers to come in your life and make demons to
36:54
come um also I I I mentioned um also speaking death I just want to mention
36:59
this as its own thing as its own way to open up a door speaking words of death
37:05
over yourself speaking death over other people which simply means speaking against the word of God that opens up a
37:12
door too you are agreeing with the devil's will and Portion for your life
37:18
when you do that so that opens up a door um also making demonic Covenants
37:27
opens up a door so making a demonic Covenant can be certain things like this saying I want to
37:33
die when you just say those words out loud I want to die I want to kill myself
37:40
in the spiritual realm you are making a demonic Covenant with the
37:46
devil when you confess those words also people sometimes make deals
37:53
with the devil people hear I remember one time a gentleman got
37:58
delivered at fivefold church so powerfully he got delivered from a
38:03
demonic Covenant from a deal with a devil he made his uncle got in an accident he was
38:11
like it seemed like he might be on his deathbed so he was panicking and he didn't know about the power of Jesus he
38:17
was a Christian but didn't know about the power of Jesus but yet he heard in rap songs about making deals with the
38:24
devil and not only did he not know about the power of Jesus he didn't know the danger of making deals with the
38:31
devil he didn't know that he just knew oh you can make deals with the devil maybe he will have power to help my
38:37
uncle so he went seeking out um how to make a deal with the devil he was desperate he just went on Hollywood
38:43
Boulevard and he he started talking to someone started talking about what he
38:48
was looking for and that person worked at the the Scientology Church of Scientology and
38:55
says I can help you with that well he ended up saying you need to give up something and I can give you this
39:02
what do you want to give up and he says my happiness are you sure yes and then he says I need you to sign with blood
39:09
now and so they did and so he did and and then his uncle
39:16
survived but lived a horrible life after that no peace in such sickness and his happiness left
39:25
completely so he came to the church he actually um had a dream and heard a
39:30
woman voice speaking I think something like get out of him in the order you entered or something like that and he
39:38
knew it was from God so he just was obsessed all of a sudden with trying to find that voice he was looking for Joyce
39:43
Meyer it wasn't Joyce Meyer and then one time he he stumbled upon a video of fold church or me
39:50
ministering and was like that's her and so he came to the church we were
39:55
in the park of the the time and he starts manifesting I call them forward and I start commanding the demon to
40:01
go and um all of a sudden as I'm commanding the demon to
40:06
go all of a sudden a demon speaks out of him he made a
40:13
deal and so when the demons spoke that the we don't need to listen to Demons to
40:18
give us information by the way but sometimes it is a way Holy Spirit reveals by those demons manifesting and
40:26
they speak something so in that moment I I knew there was a deal he made with a devil so
40:34
I said demon allow him to speak now because I knew that I couldn't just say
40:39
go go go go there was a key that was needed to unlock this Deliverance which
40:45
was him to renounce the Covenant so I said to him did you ever make a deal
40:51
with the devil he says yes and then he explained it what I just shared with you
40:56
and he says I renounced that and I prayed for I commanded the demon to go and the demon left him
41:04
and Hallelujah I'm going to have to share this video and testimony after this so
41:10
you so those of you didn't see it can see it but it was so powerful he came back and testified that he feels so much happiness that he hadn't felt this
41:17
happiness and joy since he was 5 years old so is even more than before when he
41:23
gave it to the devil praise God
41:29
Hallelujah so so it can happen by you opening up a
41:35
door demons come in it could also be by opening up a door with the wrong
41:41
relationship where someone's not surrendered to God where they are not in equally yolked relationship with you and
41:48
a demonic Soul tie can form you can be opening up a door by being in a wrong
41:54
relationship romantic friendship anything so that's that's that's you or
42:01
a person opening up a door how demons can come in number two demons can come
42:08
the O the door can be opened by abuse so young children their parents
42:15
have spiritual authority over them demons can enter by the way another
42:20
way of sin to rewind what I was just sharing about um you opening the door is
42:26
by what you're watching and listening to if you're watching horror movies a spirit of fear anxiety could
42:32
enter by listening to demonic music a demon can enter in that way too and so
42:38
think about kids actually this happened to the boy I nannied um he was 12 years
42:44
old and I was driving down Sunset Boulevard and it was around Halloween time and he he he got so afraid he
42:51
covered his eyes he's like ah tell me when we've passed that billboard and I was like what what happened and it was a
42:58
it was a demonic Halloween movie that's like uh it has it was like a sequel has
43:05
you know many different movies and he said the earlier movie when I was young
43:10
I just walked in my parents watching it and ever since I did that I have
43:15
nightmares of that movie so a spirit that a de a demon entered him when he
43:22
saw that movie um but he didn't want to see that movie but the door was opened because
43:27
the parents have Spiritual Authority so you can't just play anything for your kids to be around you
43:34
you're in charge of keeping doors shut to the devil for your
43:39
children right and so it's it can be the same way when abuse happens a parent
43:46
could be allowing someone with doors open up to the
43:51
devil into the home and then the child could get
43:58
abused now that was because the parent opened up the
44:03
door and that's how demons could come to the child and so many people are are
44:08
being freed now from demons that entered them through abuse sexual abuse as a
44:14
child and it wasn't the child opening up the door but it was the the
44:19
parents um and some and and a lot of this stuff is just because my people perish because of lack of knowledge
44:26
people didn't know any better they didn't know the real harm um of keeping people close around
44:32
who have doors open up to the devil you know so it's not to have shame but it's
44:38
time our eyes are opened up and it's time we get freedom and equipping
44:45
Hallelujah and also um when a person is abused
44:51
like maybe if they're a teenager let's say or in their 20s or or 30s or
44:56
whenever they Abus in their life um they can be abused and then the devil can
45:03
strategically send lies saying this was your fault you're dirty now you're not pure it was your fault that you were
45:10
abused um you should have shame and so a lot of people you know may they didn't
45:17
open up a door for abuse to come they weren't you know the abuse just happened it wasn't even a person they were in a
45:23
relationship with they couldn't control it but they were supposed to then reject
45:28
the lies of the devil that came but many people don't know don't have this equipping so they believe these lies of
45:34
the devil are truth and they accept them so they've actually opened the door now by by agreeing with those
45:42
lies so renouncing abuse is important renouncing agreeing with the lies that
45:49
came after the abuse is important as well
45:54
amen and then another way a door can open up can be
46:00
through past Generations so this isn't you opening up a door but this would be or the person you're praying for because
46:07
we're talking about casting demons out of people um but it could be the a
46:13
parent or a past generation that opened up a door that brought a generational curse upon the family that is now being
46:21
passed down especially when one is involved with
46:26
witchcraft when you're you know actively accessing
46:32
demonic powers like that it it is generally a deeper kind of Torment like
46:37
generally that's when generational curses come when there have been doors open up to
46:43
Witchcraft because it's deeper than just like sinning but you are now like going
46:50
full on the devil's side and seeking him for powers
46:56
and so that generally brings a deeper kind of Torment generational curse that can be passed
47:02
down so those are all the ways that doors can be opened so it can be you
47:08
opening up a door or the person opening up the door or a parent from the past or
47:14
past Generations amen hallelujah and then
47:23
um as I shared crystals um things can witchcraft items sometimes you can have
47:31
a crystal that your Bel is going to heal you so that Crystal that Crystal itself
47:38
has a demonic power attached to it um witchcraft books or something some anything involved with witchcraft
47:44
demonic powers can be attached to it rings or other jewelry that maybe
47:49
someone who manipulated you in a past relationship where you know there's a demonic Soul tight in
47:56
a demonic Spirit can be on that piece of jewelry that object it doesn't have to
48:02
be jewelry just objects and so all of those things that I just mentioned and
48:07
more it's important you renounce them and actually throw them away like what
48:13
they were doing in the book of Acts burning throw them away renouncing them and throwing them away
48:24
amen so as you're praying for as you're praying for
48:30
people um I just want to mention this for you to know that when a person
48:35
renounces it does make the the grip of the devil the demons
48:43
loosen when there is a high level anointing and that key is not
48:50
needed they don't it it's not like like just the the Declaration walking in
48:55
authority that's enough Boom the demons
49:00
go but when there isn't as high level of
49:06
anointing renouncing will probably be like for many of you probably you will
49:11
use you will ask a person to renounce most times many times because if if the
49:20
anointing isn't very high level it really helps the the legal access of the
49:26
Demons the grip to loosen amen so it can look different
49:33
like I If if someone came where the anointing is moving at a high level
49:39
dealing with principalities as I taught last week um they could just be here in the middle of the sermon maybe the demon
49:45
will just go no renouncing nothing or maybe like here for example I just
49:50
command the demon to go no renouncing they're free but then someone like one
49:55
of you here if you had prayed for that person before they came here
50:01
um maybe that maybe renouncing would make the demon to go but just commanding
50:07
the demon might not go you see so it depends on the level of anointing
50:13
too Hallelujah so we're going over Keys we
50:20
have faith is a key we have and Fa and and executing
50:26
Authority an anointed vessel executing Authority we have a renouncing is a key
50:32
that unlocks deliverance and we have
50:37
lastly there can be another key that may be needed and this would be sewing into
50:46
the kingdom of God where God's power is I I taught about this a couple weeks
50:54
ago so I think it was not last week not the week but the week before um it was a two-part message
51:01
about sewing and so if you didn't see those messages make sure you watch that
51:07
message because it's very important for you to understand this this key because this is new wine this is really new wine
51:14
but sometimes when especially if there has been a lot of Witchcraft in one's
51:21
past the the Demonic oppression is complex there has been a lot of sewing
51:26
into the Demonic realm that's piled up in a person's life contributing to so
51:32
much entanglement of deep demonic oppression and there is so much power in
51:39
sewing there is so much power in sewing there's reaping that happens when we sew
51:45
and and we see in the word of God that when people make sacrifices the the hand
51:50
of God moves such as King David made a sacrifice
51:55
and then all of a sudden God showed up and he said this this plague must end
52:01
now I end this plague Noah he actually made a sacrifice and the moment right
52:06
after he made that sacrifice God declared the promise that he would never wipe out Humanity again Humanity again
52:13
with a flood King Solomon made a sacrifice an offering a sacrifice to God
52:19
and God immediately appeared and said what do you want I will give it to you there is power in sacrificing it's
52:28
it's the it's the principle that that there is power in sacrificing that's why sewing into the
52:35
kingdom of God is sometimes a key that unlocks the complete
52:41
deliverance when it's more complex simply because there is such power in
52:46
the sacrifice amen and when there has been
52:52
so much sewing into the Demonic Kingdom sewing into the kingdom of God makes
52:58
that re demonic reaping to go away to be
53:05
lifted hallelujah so now I've just gone over
53:12
the main keys that unlock complete deliverance
53:19
[Applause] amen so
53:25
it's important you just have this understanding when it's time for you to cast out a demon when it's time for you
53:30
to pra someone and see them set free it's important you have this understanding it's a big understanding like there's a lot right so make sure
53:38
you take notes go back to this message take notes it's not as simple as just
53:44
demon go sometimes there can be other keys that are needed
53:52
Hallelujah um so when it comes time to now pray for the
53:59
person lots of times you will you will you can ask them to renounce ask them to
54:05
renounce you can explain to them what renouncing is they might not know you can explain to them and ask them to
54:12
renounce the specific oppression in their life and also the open
54:19
doors that they've had in their past because what we're doing is we are
54:25
pinpointing where the legal access is to make sure the demons can't hold on
54:31
in any place Hallelujah so ask them to renounce it's
54:38
it's also important sometimes the key is is that they need to renounce something specifically they need to take their renouncing seriously it might not they
54:47
might not know everything they need to renounce right away they might need to go and take some time that can be some
54:53
of you here your keys to be completely free you can come receive some deliverance and you can be like I need
54:59
more I need more but God wants you to go home and take your deliverance seriously
55:05
Take Your Surrender seriously and spend time with him and write down on a list with him all of the specific things that
55:12
he's leading you to renounce and then next Sunday maybe now that you are ready you've taken it seriously you've really
55:19
surrendered now it's time for God to free you all the way
55:25
amen so that's important that we understand that understand God's timing so we're not just like get out get out
55:31
get out I I don't feel fully free get out and we keep going when that's it's
55:37
not being spiritual amen so you can ask the person to if
55:42
they'd like to renounce and then you can say after they have renounced you can say I detach you from what you've
55:50
announced or I detach you from these things this isn't a script it's very important we are following the leading
55:56
of the Holy Spirit and not treating it like a a mechanical thing amen so I
56:02
detach you from these things and I declare these Spirits must go or I
56:09
declare these demons must go or I command these demons must go or they must leave it doesn't matter how you say
56:15
it amen but it's what you are saying that
56:21
matters in jesus' name but that also doesn't have to to be a robotic script
56:27
because because you Jesus is your lord and this anointing you have received has
56:32
come from Jesus you are coming in the name of Jesus so for me to come when I came up
56:39
on the stage to say and I say welcome everyone I didn't have to tell you welcome everyone in the name of Jesus I
56:45
want to make sure you know that I'm coming in the name of Jesus you know I don't have to say that right so
56:51
sometimes people can be religious and think we need to say in Jesus name in Jesus name always it's good to say it a
56:57
lot but it's not like the the real meaning of in Jesus name is the spirit
57:03
in the spirit in the spirit of the name of Jesus the spirit that you're coming
57:09
in Hallelujah so you don't have to say get out in Jesus name it's not like the
57:14
demon won't go if you don't say in Jesus name you know Hallelujah and I'm just saying this
57:21
so you don't get in this like robotic formula scripts cuz that's always going that's
57:28
always entering into religion territory we want to stay out of religion territory cuz that's the old wine
57:35
amen hallelujah so I declare these Spirits must go in jesus' name and um
57:43
that's it that's it you don't have to keep repeating get out get out get out
57:49
get out sometimes maybe holy spirit's revealing more to the person you can ask
57:55
them is there anything else you wanted to renounce sometimes God may lead you
58:02
prophetically sometimes you can you can prophetically be declaring these Spirits must
58:09
go it's just with the leading of the Holy Spirit hallelujah thank you Jesus there's
58:16
something I also want to share with it in the teaching that you can also speak I break
58:21
generational curses as you're praying for people sometimes people have had word curses
58:26
spoken over of them especially if they've been abused verbally you can say
58:32
I break every word curse sometimes if people have renounced
58:38
relationships um demonic soul ties manipulation you can say I break every
58:43
demonic Soul tie sometimes there can be a curse of poverty if they're renouncing that or if
58:51
God shows you prophetically you can say I break the curse of poverty if witchcraft if they've been
58:57
involved with witchcraft or witchcraft has happened in the family you can say I Break Every curse of Witchcraft amen I
59:05
just wanted to add that into the teaching that as the Holy Spirit leads you can also speak that as well but once
59:12
again it's not something religious we don't need to always speak it and sometimes curses will be broken as
59:18
you're commanding demons to go Hallelujah and then um once you have
59:25
prayed for them they are free you can you can speak I release
59:32
this anointing upon you may or you can speak May the fire of the Holy Spirit come upon you or you can speak be filled
59:39
with the anointing be filled with peace once again this is not about a routine or a
59:45
script but you're just you being a vessel and God is doing
59:50
everything so you don't have to say these specific words for the anointed to come and fill them for the for the uh
59:57
baptism of the Holy Spirit to come upon someone but holy spirit may lead you sometimes to
1:00:02
say be baptized in the Holy Spirit but in the in the acts Church
1:00:08
we're seeing Peter the apostles they're preaching and the Bible says that all of a sudden the Holy Spirit fell upon the
1:00:14
people as they were speaking and they began speaking in other tongues so that shows us that people can receive the
1:00:20
baptism of the Holy Spirit without you saying I baptize you in the Holy Spirit
1:00:26
and I say that because I think some people think that when they cast a demon out they're like we have to fill them
1:00:32
now be filled with the Holy Spirit Come on speak in tongues like they think they need to
1:00:38
hear them speaking in tongues or they're not filled with the Holy Spirit oh no demons are going to come back no
1:00:45
relax simply walk in your Authority don't over complicated H holy spirit is
1:00:50
really the one who's doing all everything amen they will be
1:01:00
filled Hallelujah now
1:01:05
um sometime I want to share now um for
1:01:12
healing sometimes a demon can be behind the sickness sometimes you can just say
1:01:18
be healed the sickness must leave you how the Holy Spirit leads but um sometimes it could be a
1:01:25
demon that's behind it I remember one time I ministered in Houston and I in Mass Deliverance this woman testified
1:01:31
later that I did Mass Deliverance I said Spirit of infirmity must go and she said that when I spoke that she fell back
1:01:37
with the power of God and um she had oh what was it what was the disease she had
1:01:44
does anyone remember that testimony it's something with an L I
1:01:50
don't know she had I think it's l no maybe not L she had some sort of disease
1:01:55
and it made her um her her ears not be able to hear she was
1:02:01
deaf and when she felt she fell back with the power of God and all of a sudden her her hearing a were too loud
1:02:09
her ears opened up so the spirit was needed to be cast out for the healing to
1:02:16
come so sometimes you need to command the spirit of infirmity to go sometimes
1:02:22
it's just Healing The Sick you're just sickness go be healed
1:02:32
Hallelujah so now after the prayer has taken place there's a few things that can
1:02:40
happen a person can be set free and they can truly feel it tangibly I'm free
1:02:49
Hallelujah that can happen SEC or a person can be set free
1:02:57
but there is no physical manifestation they don't feel anything different but they are actually
1:03:05
free because it's in the spiritual realm that these Miracles take place only sometimes do they manifest into the
1:03:11
Physical Realm where you can feel it and there's physical evidence immediately only sometimes
1:03:18
amen so it's important for that person that doesn't feel anything that they
1:03:24
that they receive by faith they believe that they have been
1:03:31
freed and encourage them in that that don't don't look for a feeling believe you are healed believe you are free
1:03:40
amen another thing can happen after you prayed for a person a person can still
1:03:46
be manifesting sometimes it's the demons
1:03:51
are continuing to go God is still working anointing can be like medicine taking
1:03:57
some time to work in a person so this sometimes this happens here where someone's still manif
1:04:03
someone's manifest well someone's being free but a person thinks they're
1:04:08
manifesting a person's actually being free they're in the process of being free of God delivering them but other
1:04:15
people can think that it's just demons manifesting and no Freedom happening and
1:04:20
they can think keep commanding the demon to go that's that's why after service
1:04:25
it's not time to issue new commands over people God has done the work the words
1:04:31
have been commanded declared freedom is happening Freedom has happened and for some it's still
1:04:38
happening for for for many it's not manifestation they're actually being
1:04:44
free God's working still so don't touch
1:04:49
uh a wound let it heal don't poke it by issu ising new commands when God's in
1:04:56
the process of healing it
1:05:03
amen and then also another thing that can happen once
1:05:09
you once you once you prayed for a person is that the person can be delivered or healed on their
1:05:16
way as what happened with those with Le with Leprosy Luke 17711 Jesus continued
1:05:22
on toward Jerusalem he reached the Border between Galilee and Samaria as he entered a village there 10 men with
1:05:27
Leprosy stood at a distance crying out Jesus Master have mercy on us he looked at them and said go show yourselves to
1:05:33
the priests and as they went they were cleansed of their leprosy as they went
1:05:39
on their way so they they they received the
1:05:45
anointing the healing began but it wasn't finished yet it wasn't it didn't
1:05:51
manifest physically until later until they left Jesus so that's how
1:05:56
deliverance and healing can happen too when you pray for a person it they may not see any kind of
1:06:03
difference yet but it's begun in the spiritual realm and it will come into completion as the person walks in faith
1:06:12
and rejects the lies of the devil saying you're not free you're not healed you need more
1:06:17
amen so those are all the different things that can happen but I also want to mention to that you also must be
1:06:24
humble and realize that it could be a higher level
1:06:29
demon so maybe the demon didn't actually go or maybe one demon left but there's
1:06:35
more still there you dealt with the lower level demon but there's higher level demons there still so you really
1:06:42
need to have humility and the fear of God when praying for someone don't just assume they're completely
1:06:49
free you know and so what's so important once you prayed for someone is that you
1:06:57
tell them the importance of surrendering to God that's how you keep the door shut
1:07:04
to the devil and that's how you find true abundant life eternal life Abundant Life
1:07:10
here and now and number two they must come to be planted at a
1:07:18
church where God's power is because that's one of the
1:07:24
doors that will be opened for demons to come back if you don't plant yourself this is a principle from God that we
1:07:30
must follow this is where we see receive equipping of how to keep doors shut even
1:07:35
and this is how we receive anointing of protection covering of protection it's needed we need this
1:07:43
spiritually that we're malnourished without it we're lost without it without the equipping and the anointing that
1:07:49
comes in the church the the real Church where God's power is so you must tell
1:07:54
them after you pray for them the importance of planning yourself you can tell them they can watch online just
1:08:01
share with them share so those of you that are at fivefold church this is your church this is your home you watching
1:08:06
tell them about fivefold church tell them how to watch online tell them the importance of of continually tuning in
1:08:13
and receiving the anointing tell them you may need more freedom you'll get it here the anointing is going to is high
1:08:20
level there you're going to be free completely free keep watching and I have a playlist on my
1:08:27
YouTube called how to receive and maintain complete deliverance and it and there's a
1:08:33
four-part message on how to maintain your deliverance you must tell everyone you
1:08:40
pray for to watch these videos because it's so important it's so important you have to
1:08:47
be serious about keeping your freedom you have to be serious about rejecting the devil having victory over the devilz
1:08:53
cuz the devil's not happy whenever anybody's set free and he will try to come back so you got to be equipped
1:09:00
that's why I did a four-part sermon it's more than 4 hours long you should tell
1:09:06
them to watch it and watch it again and again and again and again and take it so seriously because the devil's serious
1:09:14
about stealing killing and destroying coming back we got to be even more serious about having victory over the
1:09:20
devil about surrendering to Jesus and maintaining our
1:09:26
freedom amen so have the fear of God when you pray for somebody and speak to them from the
1:09:33
heart the importance of these things of being planted and maintaining your
1:09:40
deliverance Hallelujah so you need to have in your heart when you pray for someone I must
1:09:46
tell them the importance of getting under the powerful anointing for complete Freedom protection equipping
1:09:55
and impartation in their life I must tell them this is important
1:10:01
because you may need more number one you need you need protection number two and number three you need to be
1:10:08
equipped you need to grow in the Lord hallelujah
1:10:16

1:10:30
anointing Hallelujah follow the Holy Spirit follow the Holy Spirit there will
1:10:37

1:10:44

1:10:51
