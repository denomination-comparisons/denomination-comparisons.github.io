hi i'm apostle catherine and welcome to
0:33
another episode of revival is now
0:36
in this revival god is restoring what we
0:40
see in the book of acts to the body of
0:42
christ today and one of the big things
0:44
that's missing is the power of god by
0:47
and large
0:49
in the acts church healing's deliverance
0:51
his miracles were happening all the time
0:54
and it even says that when people who
0:57
were sick and even possessed went
0:58
underneath apostle peter's shadow
1:00
they were all healed
1:03
so this is what's happening in this
1:05
revival is it's time for healings
1:08
deliverances miracles it's time for you
1:11
to be healed and delivered and receive
1:12
whatever miracle you need
1:14
so today we are going to learn
1:16
the first step in how to
1:19
receive miracles from jesus
1:22
jesus said to his disciples go into all
1:24
the world and preach the gospel to every
1:28
creature
1:29
step one is for you to hear and believe
1:32
in the gospel of jesus christ
1:35
now some of you may have never heard the
1:37
gospel and you'll hear it for the first
1:38
time but at the same time there are many
1:41
of you who have heard
1:43
the gospel
1:45
but there's a part of the gospel you
1:47
have never heard before perhaps and
1:49
today you'll hear what that is for god
1:52
so loved the world that he gave his one
1:54
and only son that whoever believes in
1:56
him shall not perish but have eternal
1:59
life god sent his only son jesus as a
2:03
sacrifice for us to save us to save us
2:07
from sin from going to hell he saved us
2:10
so that we could have eternal life so
2:12
when we die we will go to heaven and
2:14
live with god for eternity god made him
2:17
who had no sin to be sin for us so that
2:20
in him we might become the righteousness
2:23
of god number two jesus took all of our
2:27
sins away and we became the
2:30
righteousness of god
2:31
so when you give your life to jesus when
2:33
you confess that jesus is lord
2:36
you have received this free gift from
2:38
god that all of your sins are taken away
2:42
jesus was perfect we were sin
2:45
he became sin for us he took on what we
2:49
should have taken on that suffering and
2:51
that pain and death but jesus took it on
2:54
as a sacrifice so we wouldn't have to so
2:57
now when he did that he removed all of
2:59
our sins and we became the righteousness
3:02
of god he actually calls us you are the
3:04
righteousness of god meaning you're in
3:07
right standing with god you don't have
3:09
to do anything to be my child is how god
3:13
sees it you are my child you are pure
3:16
you are the righteousness of god before
3:19
jesus came people were bound by sin
3:22
there was the law which had so many
3:24
parts to it and they would try to
3:27
fulfill the law
3:29
to be in right standing with god but
3:32
because there were so many and because
3:34
we as humans are naturally sinful in
3:36
nature they could never measure up they
3:39
could never fulfill all the laws they
3:41
would make sacrifices to try to cover up
3:43
their sins they would make sacrifices of
3:46
animals and that blood would cover their
3:48
sins temporarily but it would never
3:51
completely remove their sins so people
3:53
were just living
3:55
as sinners
3:56
jesus came and he took away our sins
3:59
completely the sins are removed
4:02
past present and future and now you are
4:04
no longer a sinner you are a child of
4:07
god you are pure you're the
4:08
righteousness of god and as long as
4:11
you're seeking god
4:13
daily you've given your life to him
4:15
that's how god's always seen you we are
4:17
on a journey to be transformed into the
4:19
image of god so that means that you may
4:21
make mistakes sometimes you may sin
4:24
sometimes but that doesn't make you a
4:26
sinner as long as you're repentant and
4:29
you turn to god and you say i'm sorry
4:31
help me lord i don't want to do this sin
4:33
again god immediately forgives you
4:35
immediately removes your sin doesn't
4:37
even remember it
4:39
and he calls you the righteousness of
4:41
god pure
4:43
as soon as you repent you could have
4:44
sinned
4:45
one minute ago but you repent
4:48
earnestly from your heart
4:50
god's forgotten it already the next
4:52
thing that jesus has given us is he tore
4:54
the veil in the spiritual realm so that
4:57
there is no longer a barrier between us
5:00
and god communication
5:02
between us and god but now we can have
5:05
direct
5:06
contact and intimacy with the holy
5:09
spirit therefore brethren having
5:11
boldness to enter the holiest by the
5:13
blood of jesus by a new and living way
5:15
which he consecrated for us through the
5:18
veil that is his flesh let us draw near
5:21
with a true heart in full assurance of
5:23
faith in the old testament the presence
5:25
of god was in a temple it was in the
5:28
holiest of holies in a room within rooms
5:31
and only
5:33
a couple priests
5:34
could actually go to the holy of holies
5:37
once in a while
5:38
no one else could go there so no one
5:40
else could be in direct contact with the
5:42
presence of god there was a veil you
5:44
couldn't go through
5:46
jesus tore the veil
5:48
so now that means that holy spirit has
5:51
come to live inside of you the moment
5:53
you receive jesus as the lord and savior
5:55
of your life and you are one there's no
5:58
veil anymore he's literally one with you
6:00
and he's always with you he never leaves
6:02
you you can talk with him anytime you
6:05
don't need a middle man you can have
6:08
intimacy with holy spirit
6:10
without anything else that's it now you
6:13
might have heard the gospel before what
6:15
i've just shared
6:16
and think that that's it
6:18
in fact that was me
6:21
up until
6:22
about seven years ago
6:24
i had only heard
6:26
that jesus died for our sins holy spirit
6:28
lives in us now and we go to heaven when
6:31
we die
6:32
i only heard that
6:35
when i heard the gospel that's all i
6:36
heard i thought that's all that there
6:38
was and i'd heard the gospel
6:41
a lot of times and then seven years ago
6:44
i went to a little house church and
6:46
there i encountered the power of god for
6:48
the first time
6:49
i saw demons manifest and be cast out of
6:51
people i saw people be healed
6:54
i encountered prophetic ministry and i
6:57
was shocked my spiritual eyes had opened
6:59
up like never before
7:01
and from there i learned that there is
7:04
more that jesus has actually provided
7:07
for us on the cross
7:10
and this is what i'm going to share with
7:11
you now since we are his true children
7:13
we qualify to share all his treasures
7:15
for indeed we are heirs of god himself
7:18
and since we are joined to christ we
7:20
also inherit all that he is and all that
7:23
he has you are a child of god
7:28
you have an inheritance
7:31
from
7:32
god
7:33
you inherit all that jesus is and all
7:37
that jesus has
7:39
wow when you stop to think about that
7:41
that's a lot and that is
7:45
heaven
7:47
heaven on earth
7:49
in jesus there is abundant life there is
7:52
healing there is freedom there is joy
7:55
there is
7:56
peace that's your inheritance
8:00
this is the thing many people do not
8:02
know that there's actually an
8:04
inheritance that jesus provided for you
8:07
on the cross
8:09
so when jesus went on the cross and he
8:12
shed blood and he was crucified he was
8:15
purchasing
8:17
something massive for you on that cross
8:20
there was such tremendous power in that
8:23
blood he purchased
8:26
a big inheritance for you for you to
8:29
receive freely as a gift from god by
8:32
grace through faith to receive this
8:35
today and to enjoy it and to be the
8:37
biggest light for jesus to the world to
8:40
show
8:41
look what life is like with jesus so now
8:44
what is this inheritance
8:46
this inheritance is it says the thief
8:49
comes only to steal and kill and destroy
8:52
but i jesus
8:54
have come that they may have life and
8:57
have it to the
8:59
full
9:00
he made this sacrifice on the cross
9:03
for you to have life to the full
9:07
life in abundance
9:10
this means
9:11
abundance in every area of your life
9:15
jesus did not say i've come that they
9:17
may have life and have it to the full in
9:18
this area in this area but maybe not
9:20
these areas he said
9:22
life to the full this means every single
9:26
area of your life
9:28
like this
9:30
health
9:31
abundant health
9:33
it says in isaiah 53 5 he was wounded
9:36
for our transgressions he was bruised
9:39
for our iniquities the chastisement for
9:41
our peace was upon him and by his
9:44
stripes we are healed stripes what does
9:48
that mean that means that jesus before
9:50
he even went on the cross he was
9:52
shedding blood for you before when there
9:55
was scourging that he was enduring he
9:57
endured much scourging scourging means
10:00
there was a whip there were sharp pieces
10:03
on the end of this whip
10:05
so that when jesus was whipped
10:08
it wasn't just lashes
10:10
but there was even
10:12
pieces of flesh coming out
10:14
he was shedding blood he was going
10:16
through that horrendous scourging
10:18
for you to have healing today
10:22
jesus was purchasing
10:24
healing for you when he endured that
10:26
scourging he did not do it for nothing
10:30
he did it for you to be healed of that
10:32
sickness of that disease he did it for
10:34
you to be freed
10:35
of any kind of oppression
10:38
that healing
10:39
is for every area of your body
10:42
your your mind your soul your heart
10:48
jesus has paid the price it says
10:51
by his stripes you are healed not maybe
10:53
you'll be healed
10:55
you are healed meaning this is part of
10:58
your inheritance it is your right from
11:01
god you the devil cannot argue it
11:05
it's like it's a contract clear and
11:08
writing jesus paid the price for my
11:10
healing i must be healed today because
11:13
of this contract
11:15
that jesus has signed here
11:18
healing's mine
11:20
this means physical healing this means
11:22
mental healing
11:24
this means emotional healing everything
11:27
these are not just words by his stripes
11:30
we are healed
11:31
this is the contract that you can show
11:34
the devil and say you cannot take my
11:36
healing
11:37
it's
11:38
illegal
11:40
this is mine and nobody can take it
11:42
jesus gave it to me and it belongs to me
11:45
another part of your inheritance is
11:47
protection john 10 28 says i gave them
11:50
eternal life and they shall never perish
11:52
no one will snatch them out of my hand
11:57
you do not need to be afraid of anything
11:59
when you give your life to jesus because
12:01
in your inheritance god has provided to
12:04
protect you that no one can take you
12:07
from his hand
12:08
you are in his
12:10
hands the bible says that the lord
12:12
directs the steps of the righteous man
12:14
or woman
12:16
so that means that he's literally
12:18
holding your hand
12:19
leading you step by step nobody can take
12:23
you out of god's hand
12:25
when you are really surrendered to god
12:28
when you are serving him
12:31
god let me tell you
12:33
wants you here on this earth for a long
12:36
time
12:37
to accomplish the purpose he has for you
12:41
because
12:43
the more that we here on this earth as
12:45
believers can do for god for the kingdom
12:47
of god the more souls will be saved and
12:50
the more the kingdom of darkness will be
12:52
destroyed
12:54
i grabbed hold of this revelation
12:57
and i don't fear anything anymore i can
12:59
be on airplanes there can be tons of
13:01
turbulence
13:03
i can get threats or whatever from
13:05
people
13:06
and i have no fear because
13:09
i have a supernatural protection from
13:11
god
13:12
the devil cannot pierce through that
13:14
protection from god that he has around
13:16
me
13:17
i know
13:19
i have
13:21
i have an assignment to accomplish on
13:23
this earth
13:25
and it's a lot that god has for me to do
13:27
and it's not going to take just one year
13:29
or two years it's going to take a while
13:31
he has lots for me to do
13:33
and so i know that god wants me to stay
13:35
here and he's going to make sure i
13:37
finish
13:38
what i was called to do on this earth
13:41
now this is why salvation is urgent
13:44
though because when you
13:46
have not given your life to jesus or
13:47
when you're not serious about
13:49
surrendering to jesus
13:52
you don't have that protection
13:55
this is this is one of the great joys of
13:57
surrendering to god you can't you never
14:00
have to fear about anyone harming you
14:03
about
14:04
dying you can have sickness and think
14:07
well
14:08
there's no way i'm gonna die from this
14:10
sickness because i know
14:12
i have a lot of things that i need to do
14:14
for god still that he called me to do
14:17
protection is part of your inheritance
14:20
supernatural protection from god is part
14:22
of your inheritance from jesus the next
14:25
part of your inheritance is provision
14:28
curse is the ground because of you
14:30
through painful toil you will eat from
14:32
it all the days of your life
14:34
there was a curse upon humanity before
14:36
jesus came so people would work they
14:39
would work hard
14:40
but
14:41
there was not favor upon their work and
14:43
it was the ground was cursed they they
14:46
would just work and work and it was
14:47
painful and they wouldn't get to reap
14:50
from their hard work
14:52
but jesus destroyed that curse
14:55
and now he he has given us an
14:57
inheritance of
14:59
supernatural provision from him abundant
15:02
provision now he blesses the work of
15:05
your hands
15:07
so when you work for jesus when you're
15:09
doing what he's called you to do and
15:11
maybe that's a mundane job maybe that's
15:13
your career where you're at right now
15:15
but god called you to do that
15:17
he's literally blessing the work of your
15:19
hands just as
15:21
moses had a staff in his hand it was
15:23
ordinary but when he used it for god's
15:26
will miracles happened through the works
15:29
of his hand
15:30
in the same way when you
15:33
are serving jesus surrender doing what
15:35
he's called you to do your work will be
15:37
blessed
15:39
you will reap there will be protection
15:42
over your finances
15:44
and there will be favor upon you my god
15:46
will supply every need of yours
15:49
according to his riches in glory in
15:51
christ
15:52
jesus
15:53
so because of jesus because of what he's
15:55
done now god will supply every need
15:58
and we we see this example of god saying
16:02
bring tithe into the storehouse and see
16:04
that i won't pour out so many blessings
16:06
for you that there's not even room in
16:08
your lap
16:09
for all the blessings he also says
16:12
what you sow you will reap if you sow
16:14
sparingly you will reap sparingly but if
16:16
you sow abundantly you'll reap
16:18
abundantly
16:19
so as long as you sow as long as you're
16:22
giving to the kingdom of god as long as
16:23
you're working at what god's called you
16:25
to do you'll never be in lack
16:28
you will have more than enough and there
16:30
will be favor upon your finances
16:34
in your inheritance there is also
16:36
peace
16:37
perfect peace i leave the gift of peace
16:40
with you my peace not the kind of
16:42
fragile peace given by the world but my
16:45
perfect peace don't yield to fear or be
16:48
troubled in your hearts instead be
16:51
courageous
16:52
so jesus is saying i have given you
16:55
perfect peace
16:57
he paid the price for you to have an
16:59
inheritance of perfect peace meaning
17:01
that there can be so much attack from
17:03
the devil in this world there can be
17:06
seasons where you're in the valley when
17:08
things are hard when you're going
17:09
through fire
17:11
when there's heartbreak when there's
17:13
loss when there's death
17:15
and just things happen but jesus has
17:18
paid a price on the cross for you to
17:20
literally always be in perfect peace
17:23
perfect peace means
17:25
it's not of this world peace of this
17:26
world means when things go good you have
17:29
peace but when things go bad you don't
17:30
have peace but perfect peace means that
17:33
no matter what highs or lows
17:36
there's a supernatural peace that jesus
17:38
has given to you and as you put your
17:40
eyes on jesus you will access that
17:43
perfect peace so whenever anxiety comes
17:46
in your mind you should know
17:49
no i have an inheritance of perfect
17:51
peace something's wrong here this must
17:53
go
17:54
because perfect peace has been given to
17:56
me it's my right to always have it
17:59
in this inheritance we also have
18:00
received the power of god living inside
18:04
of us if the spirit of him who raised
18:06
jesus from the dead dwells in you he who
18:08
raised christ jesus from the dead will
18:10
also give life to your mortal bodies
18:13
through his spirit who dwells in you
18:17
so when you give your life to jesus you
18:20
are no longer like normal humans in the
18:22
world without jesus
18:24
they are mere humans but you have become
18:28
a supernatural being
18:30
you are one with god who created the
18:33
whole universe holy spirit literally
18:36
lives inside of you and he's full of
18:39
power and so now you're living a
18:42
supernatural life this is the
18:44
inheritance this is part of the
18:46
inheritance that jesus is giving you
18:49
that you would have the holy spirit to
18:51
empower you throughout your days to do
18:53
anything empower you to have strength
18:56
empower you to have wisdom empower you
18:59
to have intellect empower you to do
19:02
anything you need to do
19:04
any kind of ability speak
19:06
you have
19:08
god partnering with you and giving you
19:10
his
19:11
power you have holy spirit in you to
19:14
speak to you to direct you to lead you
19:17
to true life every single day to lead
19:20
you out of harm's way you're living a
19:22
supernatural life one
19:24
with god
19:26
also jesus has provided authority over
19:29
the devil
19:31
he returned the authority that was lost
19:33
from adam and eve he returned it to you
19:36
so now
19:37
the devil does not have any kind of
19:39
authority over you you have authority
19:41
over the devil i have given you
19:43
authority to tremble on snakes and
19:45
scorpions and to overcome all the power
19:48
of the enemy
19:49
nothing will harm you
19:52
you have authority now over every attack
19:56
of the devil he's a liar and he wants to
19:59
make you think that he has authority but
20:02
that is a lie because he is the father
20:04
of lies the truth is
20:06
you have the authority it is part of
20:09
your inheritance that jesus has provided
20:11
for you
20:12
so he cannot get away with his lies he
20:15
cannot
20:17
force himself on you and force his way
20:19
and will on you you are the one that has
20:22
authority over him you
20:25
now have to execute it
20:27
this is the full gospel
20:30
there is so much of the gospel that many
20:35
in the body of christ have never heard i
20:37
know this because i was just this open
20:40
christian in many different christian
20:42
circles for 24 years of my life until
20:46
i heard the full gospel and hearing the
20:50
full gospel changed everything for me
20:53
when i heard the full gospel that began
20:56
my first step into receiving
20:59
abundant life from jesus and walking in
21:03
it i can tell you now
21:05
abundant life is more than possible i am
21:08
living proof i'm walking in it now
21:12
what you've just heard
21:13
this
21:14
really is what jesus has provided for
21:17
you
21:18
it is accessible to you
21:20
it is jesus wants it for you more than
21:22
anything he's already given all these
21:25
things to you healing freedom abundant
21:27
life provision
21:29
it is like this
21:31
it's like parents who
21:33
think so carefully about presents they
21:35
want to give their children on christmas
21:37
day and they
21:38
say they spend tons of money on it and
21:40
they wrap it up all beautiful and
21:42
they're they put the child's name on it
21:44
and they're so excited for them to open
21:45
the present that's like what jesus has
21:47
done he
21:49
purchased the most expensive gifts for
21:51
you
21:51
he did it just as a free gift for you
21:54
because he loves you so much
21:56
he's wrapped it up it's under the tree
21:59
and there's a name tag with your name on
22:02
it but you actually have to
22:05
look and see your name on it
22:06
acknowledge and accept that it's really
22:09
for you
22:10
from jesus because he loves you so much
22:12
and then you have to actually open it to
22:14
receive it
22:16
and then you actually have to cherish it
22:17
and value it to hold on to it to not
22:20
lose it this is for you it's right there
22:23
for you now ready for you to grab and
22:25
receive
22:26
revivals now and it's time for you to
22:29
receive this abundant life finally
22:32
that jesus may receive the reward of his
22:34
suffering he didn't suffer for nothing
22:38
it brings him the greatest joy for you
22:40
to actually receive
22:42
these gifts that he paid such a price
22:45
for it says as you go preach saying the
22:47
kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the
22:49
sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
22:51
cast out demons freely you have received
22:54
freely give so jesus was telling the
22:56
disciples preach preach the gospel the
22:59
full gospel preach saying the kingdom of
23:01
heaven is at hand meaning
23:04
all that is in heaven it's here for you
23:06
now abundant life is here for you now
23:09
it's at hand so he was telling the
23:11
disciples preach this it's like what i'm
23:13
doing today letting you know it's here
23:15
for you this is what jesus has done for
23:17
you and then jesus says
23:19
and then after you preached heal the
23:21
sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
23:23
cast out demons so in other words he's
23:25
like
23:26
after you shared what people can receive
23:29
now release it to them
23:31
now that they have faith
23:33
to receive this release it to them the
23:36
bible says my people perish because of
23:38
lack of knowledge many people are
23:40
perishing because of the lack of the
23:41
knowledge of the full gospel we receive
23:45
salvation by grace through faith
23:48
there are many people who are only
23:50
receiving part of the gospel because
23:52
that's the only part that they are aware
23:54
of and have faith in
23:57
so there are many christians living
23:59
powerless lives in lack sick and
24:02
oppressed they will go to heaven
24:05
because they believe in that they might
24:07
have a relationship with god here right
24:08
now because they believe in that
24:10
but they do not know about the rest of
24:13
the inheritance from jesus so they don't
24:16
have faith in it because they don't know
24:17
my people perish because of lack of
24:18
knowledge but the bible says you shall
24:21
know the truth and the truth shall set
24:22
you free
24:23
so here you know the truth today it's
24:26
time for you to believe in this truth so
24:29
you can be set free
24:31
and by the way this abundant life
24:33
that jesus has given us it's
24:36
it's not just selfishly for us like it's
24:38
not just like
24:39
this exciting news that we can have
24:41
abundant life now it's bigger than that
24:43
the more that we are walking in god's
24:46
abundant life
24:47
the more we are shining brightly for
24:50
jesus to the world we're the light of
24:52
the world and it's us being a light that
24:55
attracts the lost
24:57
it's not us
24:58
preaching partial gospel
25:01
and living in lack and bondage and
25:04
sickness
25:05
the world doesn't want that that's not
25:07
attracting how we are the light
25:10
how we are the biggest light we can be
25:12
is by preaching the full gospel and
25:15
living it out and showing people
25:17
testifying
25:19

25:20
