the biggest tools you have, one of the most important tools you have to spread
36:42
this good news that God has entrusted you with. This platform God has entrusted you with. Maybe it feels like
36:48
your social media platform is small, but the potential that every single person's
36:54
social media platform has right now is so exciting and so amazing. how God can
36:59
do wonders through your social media to reach many many people. The way the
37:04
algorithm it can be picked up on the algorithm, the way you can share something and your share push it over
37:10
the edge where suddenly that algorithm sending it to so many more people's social media accounts on their for you
37:17
pages and everything. Hallelujah. So truly, when you walk in obedience to
37:23
use what God's put in your hand, it can seem small. just like Moses's staff didn't seem that that significant. But
37:29
when you use what God's given you, God does miracles through what you offer to
37:35
God in obedience. Amen. And so this is a big staff, one of the
37:40
biggest staffs. If you're Moses, like present day Moses, this is one of the biggest staff staffs that God has given

every one of you, all of us. Amen. Hallelujah.

[Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause]
45:21
This is our Northern California small group leaders.
45:26
Hallelujah. Welcome home. Hallelujah.
45:32
I would love to hear briefly. I know you have long testimonies, but if you could just share just a brief summary of
45:42
how God has touched you since stepping into the revival, stepping into the power of God. And uh both of you just
45:49
brief brief summary and then if you could briefly share what God is doing in the small group.
45:56
I'm gonna let Max go first. Okay. Well, um hallelujah. Um, since
46:02
coming to revival, um, you know, my life has just completely changed. Um, the first time I was here, um, the message
46:08
was very prophetic of something that was going on in my life. I received prayer from Apostle Katherine and then I came
46:14
back and receive more prayer and more deliverance and it's just like things have been unlocked, things have been
46:19
opened in my life and I'm so thankful to be here. Um, and yeah, you know, our small groups just like every week is
46:26
another chance to to learn more about the people in our area and to to hear from them about what they're going
46:32
through and to pray with them and to really stand in faith and believe in certain things. Like, you know, certain
46:37
people are like, "Oh, I'm believing this or oh, my family's doing this." And it's a great chance for us all to get together and say like, "Okay, like we're
46:43
going to pray together as a group. We're going to pray for you. We're going to pray for revival." And it's just amazing. Yeah. It's really awesome to
46:48
see everyone together like that. Yeah. Praise God. Um, we every single week we
46:56
talk about like what sticks out to us about the message and that really prompts us to like raise our faith with
47:02
one another because we're like, "Wow, we're all thinking the same thing at the same time and then we'll talk about
47:09
something one week and then Apostle Katherine talks about it the next week and we're like, is she spying on us?"
47:14
like she has wire taps on her phone or something cuz it'll literally be verbatim what we spoke about. So, it's
47:21
been lifting our faith that we don't have to be in person to be experiencing
47:27
like being one in the spirit and we can be far away but close at the same time.
47:32
And um last week we had an in-person meeting and this is like one testimony
47:38
on top of so many testimonies. like we'll pray for financial breakthrough and then boom, a check and then we'll
47:45
pray like, "Oh, like we we we want um my my my sister um Christy, she prayed uh
47:52
for someone at her work and she was like, "No, your your your family member is missing. We're going to pray." And
47:58
then boom, the family member got found. And I was like, and we're just every week in our Zoom, we're just praising
48:03
the Lord every single week. So, it's been really awesome. um just having the prophetic flow through the messages and
48:10
then we talk about it in person. And um I think the biggest thing I have really
48:16
learned and what's touched my heart the most is you shall know them by their love for one another has been made very
48:23
real to me in my life. My um I love my small group so much. They are just the
48:28
best. They have the purest hearts. They're like the first ones to make flyers, the first ones to get out there
48:33
on the streets, the first ones to edify each other and support one another. And I've just seen Jesus in them. And it's
48:40
been so touching for me. So that's like, please, if you all aren't active in your
48:46
small groups yet, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. You just have more of God's love to experience. And so I really
48:52
encourage you to put yourself out there, there's really beautiful people at 5F Church that you have yet to meet in
48:58
Jesus name. So yeah, this was a spontaneous trip for us. We weren't
49:04
Yeah, we just we just drove just this morning. Praise God. Yes. Yeah.
49:09
Led by the Holy Spirit. And you want to share your testimony? Oh, about um getting deliverance last
49:15
week? No, just in general. Oh, in general. Getting deliverance through my whole life. Um okay. Um so
49:23
Okay. Footnotes. Um, I before I was a
49:29
Christian, I had um voices of like an orphan spirit in my mind telling me I
49:37
was always going to be alone, telling me that no one was ever going to understand me, that people were always going to
49:43
abandon me, and that a life of loneliness was just like my destiny. No matter how many people were surrounding
49:50
me, it was just like this kind of loneliness all the time. I came to 5F in 2021 and I was already a Christian, but
49:58
there was nowhere where the anointing was breaking the yoke. I had gone to other churches and there was chaos, like
50:04
a lot of people laying hands on me at once, screaming, yelling, things like that. But when I came to 5F for the
50:11
first time, the spirit just left like that. It was so easy for Jesus. And ever
50:18
since then, I have just known that this is where God wants me to be planted no matter what because my Apostle Katherine
50:26
and Jesus have never given up on me. They have never and unlock your
50:31
deliverance, y'all. That I needed like that is literally like my gospel truth. I went through such a process of
50:37
deliverance like through so so so much. And so like Apostle Katherine has never
50:42
shamed me for having to go through deliverance and she's never shamed me for kind of like mysteries that God has
50:49
put me through. Um and so now I'm just kind of standing strong in the faith.
50:54
I'm blessed with um an abundant life in every area and an abundant marriage and
51:02
um a great small group. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you
51:09
Jesus. Thank you Jesus. I want to speak over you right now. I see God right now
51:15
is lifting you both to a new level, a new level in this place of leadership.
51:20
He is wiping away everything from the past that would hinder you from being a leader. From seeing yourself as God sees
51:29
you. You are perfectly made. You are perfectly made. You are perfectly made.
51:35
And I see God rewiring things in your mind. I see God revealing your identity
51:41
in Christ more and more and more, more and more and more. Everything from the
51:48
past gone. And I wipe away all of the words of people from the past and all of
51:54
the lies of the enemy that would speak against you, speak against your identity
51:59
and who you are. It's all gone now. It is gone now. And it is time to enter a
52:06
new phase, a new phase of leadership representing Jesus so well in Jesus name
52:15
in every way. And I speak this anointing to come upon you both now in Jesus'
52:22
name. Receive this new level. May your spiritual eyes open up more and may you
52:29
be led perfectly by the Holy Spirit, stepping in God's will every day. nothing holding you back in Jesus' name.
52:37
Let revival spread through this small group in Northern California. Let it
52:42
spread like a wildfire in Jesus' name. Amen.
52:49
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you,
52:54
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
53:02
Um, thank you Jesus. Wow.
53:07
Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Cheyenne from Arkansas.
53:13
Hi. You can come on up, hun.
53:24
Welcome back. So, I hear you have a testimony of what God did when you were here last time.
53:30
Yeah. So, um, it was pretty amazing. Uh, I've always struggled with, well, I was
53:38
four years sober and I didn't know God. I was an atheist and, um, we have a lot
53:45
of suicide in our family. I lost my mom, my uncle, and my two cousins to suicide
53:52
and I've also attempted. So the suicide spirit from generational trauma has
53:58
always followed me and particularly people in my family. Um
54:06
and that's been passed down and passed down. Um I also struggle with drug
54:11
addiction. Um and it wasn't until I came out here to come to treatment. Uh I
54:18
ended up 8 hours away from here and something didn't seem right. So then I ended up 30 minutes from here and God
54:25
was like, "You got to go. You got to go. You got to go." So I ended up coming and
54:31
uh something happened my first time here. Something was just taken off of me
54:38
and um I feel so free and so light. I feel so happy for the first time in my
54:44
life. [Music]
54:51
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, Jesus.
54:58
And I just I'm I'm here today to just uh renounce more of that suicide spirit
55:04
because I want my whole family free. I want my whole family to feel what I'm feeling and to be delivered completely.
55:11
And um I just want more of that as well. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. I see your
55:17
family coming. I see your family coming because they can't deny this fruit. They can't deny this change in your life. You
55:24
are the light of the world leading them to Jesus. And I speak this generational
55:29
curse of suicide must be broken off of them in Jesus' name. I declare this
55:34
suicidal spirit must go completely. They shall all live and not die. They shall
55:40
come into the kingdom. I call them into the kingdom in Jesus name. May May the
55:45
the light of Jesus flow through you and touch them. May their eyes open and see
55:50
and come to Jesus in Jesus name. Amen.
55:56
Amen. Hallelujah. Yes. Hallelujah.
56:01
We're so happy for you. We rejoice with you. Hallelujah.
56:07
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Jesus.
56:13
Thank you, Jesus. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for bringing happiness and joy
56:18
for the first time in people's lives. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to
56:24

59:58
out of new age witchcraft. And um my dad's friend, my well the church I went
1:00:06
to for my first deliverance um got delivered from 60 demons.
1:00:13
And I came here to get my second deliverance from and I got delivered
1:00:19
from witchcraft covenants that I made. And um
1:00:27
also in my I posted a video of
1:00:33
like Katherine posted a video of my second deliverance when I posted my testimony
1:00:40
and um was delivered from masturbation
1:00:45
and uh I think new age witchcraft. And
1:00:51
I um ever since those two deliverances, my life has completely changed. I am
1:00:59
fully surrendered and um doing God's work for my life. Am sharing my
1:01:05
testimonies with people that I don't even know. Like I on
1:01:13
social media, I just post my testimonies cuz it's to help other people and I want
1:01:20
people to get out of the occult and
1:01:25
basically
1:01:40
And God got me out of that occult. He can do that for everyone else in that
1:01:46
occult. And I got delivered from I had public speak,
1:01:53
fear of public speaking. I couldn't even like like to v to I was scared to
1:01:59
evangelize because I just I thought they wouldn't listen to me and just I wanted
1:02:07
that gone and God delivered me from that and
1:02:13
people pleasing I got delivered from that too and now I don't I don't even
1:02:20
care what people think. It's like
1:02:28
just ever since I've been here, I spread the good news to my brother. He I cuz he he
1:02:36
understands kind of but just plants seeds in his head and he I share my
1:02:43
testimonies and he's open to 5F church and he God has just
1:02:50
been answering my prayers like my sister's friend she wasn't she was
1:02:56
listening to bad music like sexual music and I didn't want her to go through
1:03:02
that. I so God changed her heart and now she's listening to Caleb on the radio
1:03:12
and just me applying the principles at 5F
1:03:18
just taking notes doing it. It's helped me so much. And I actually
1:03:26
got out of religion like I don't know how many weeks ago and just
1:03:34
I just post my testimony on that too. And just
1:03:41
I also my grandpa he actually he had a
1:03:47
stroke and got I prayed for him to get freed from that stroke and I believe he
1:03:52
got freed from that and he used to have so much bitterness for me from the past and now he actually
1:03:58
wants to talk to me and want and I he sees me and he's like
1:04:06
Alyssa and I'm like my prayer worked
1:04:15
because before he didn't even want to look at me at all and he was just cuz well and I
1:04:22
also prayed for my grandparents to get out of religion cuz they're deceived and Katherine declared one of the services
1:04:30
ago prayed declared for those religion Pharisee crap uh stuff to
1:04:38
uh to get out of um like to open remove
1:04:47
those blockages and that's going to help it happen for my grandparents.
1:04:53
[Music] And it's just
1:04:59
and I also prayed for to share my testimony today yesterday
1:05:04
and it happened.
1:05:10
because I wanted all of you guys to hear my whole testimony
1:05:15
to help you. Anyone that is in your family that's going through the same
1:05:21
things to for them to get out and for them to be free
1:05:27
because they need to live abundant life. No bondage. No,
1:05:33
they need to be free. And there's people that are not ready
1:05:38
for it yet, but it's God's timing. And we just need to have faith.
1:05:44
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:05:51
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:05:56
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. God is so good. He is
1:06:02
so faithful. God is so proud of you. I am proud of you. And you are free
1:06:08
indeed. Who the sun sets free is free indeed. It is gone. It is in the past all of the
1:06:14
bondage. If the enemy ever tries to lie to you, you have authority over him.
1:06:20
You can say, "Shut up. I reject you. I am free. I am totally fully free
1:06:29
because it's time to step fully in this
1:06:34
new life, new creation life. You are a new creation now. And I
1:06:41
declare that the devil can never bring you back in any way because God has great plans to use you.
1:06:49
I can see it all over you that he has put a passion for people. compassion for
1:06:55
people that are in the occult, for people who are in darkness in every way, for them to come into the light. He's
1:07:03
put that in you and he's going to use you powerfully. Many people are going to come out of
1:07:09
darkness, out of deceit. Their eyes will open up as God moves through you,
1:07:14
through your words. Hallelujah. And I speak protection over you. The devil
1:07:20
tried to fight hard for you. tried to fight hard to pull you backwards because he saw how powerful you would be in
1:07:27
God's kingdom when you were fully in the truth, fully in God's will. He's
1:07:32
defeated today. He's defeated. Thank you, Jesus.
1:07:37
Thank you, Lord. I speak that many people who were lost and in darkness would come into the kingdom through you.
1:07:44
They would hear your words. They would feel God on your words and they would come to him in Jesus name.
1:07:51
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:07:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you for sharing, Alyssa.
1:08:05
Praise God. Jesus.
1:08:10
Jesus. Diane and Christine, you can come to the stage right now.
1:08:17
Diane and Christine. Um, last Sunday they visited my
1:08:22
spiritual father, prophet Dr. Joe Davyy, his church.
1:08:28
They visited his church in Tanzania, East Africa. And wow,
1:08:35
I watched what God did at the church through my spiritual father. I was left
1:08:41
in awe. I was overflowing with joy. And actually before I want you all to share
1:08:47
about it, but before we do that, we're going to watch the video so everyone can see what happened.
1:08:56
I want to release the anointing of God upon you,
1:09:03
new levels in the mighty name of Jesus.
1:09:08
is now coming upon you to change you completely, completely.
1:09:15
Once and forever, once and forever.
1:09:23
There's going to be a great shift in your life.
1:09:28
Now the past is over. Never think of your past life
1:09:36
because I have poured a new thing in you says the Lord
1:09:42
in the mighty name of Jesus. Receive it. I I am taken back when you are 15 years.
1:09:52
Forget about the success you have now. I'm taking back when you are 15 years. The Lord is taking me back.
1:10:03
And I see some tears. And this was even though you have
1:10:09
happiness, but this was not wiped off.
1:10:16
And God is telling me to wipe that off now.
1:10:22
So your joy So your joy will be forever
1:10:30
and it will be a blessing for the body of Christ. I release the anointing upon you to wipe
1:10:38
off completely that tears
1:10:44
in the mighty name of Jesus. And from now you will be the happiest
1:10:53
person on earth. And you will bring so many people
1:11:01
through your your life.
1:11:06
You will bring so many to Christ through your life.
1:11:13
And that time is coming. is coming. Thank you, Jesus.
1:11:23
Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
1:11:31
You all got to receive the ministry of a prophet. God is restoring apostles and
1:11:36
prophets in this global revival that he has brought. And these are needed to perfect the body
1:11:44
of Christ for Jesus to return. apostles and prophets, they've been missing by
1:11:49
and large. And the ministries of the apostles and prophets, the equipping that they bring, the way God uses them
1:11:56
specifically is so vital, is so needed. Apostles, pastors, apostles, prophets,
1:12:02
pastors, evangelists, and teachers, God uses them each differently and uniquely.
1:12:07
In Ephesians 4:11-16 says that God that holy that Jesus poured out his spirit
1:12:12
and gave these gifts to the church for the equipping of the believers so that they would come into maturity and they
1:12:18
would be equipped to do the works of service to God themselves. So we need
1:12:24
all five offices and I would love for you to share just your experience of the
1:12:30
ministry of a prophet and just all that God did when you were there.
1:12:35
Yes. So God shocked me. I just like couldn't even imagine
1:12:41
what would have happened. Like what I saw, I couldn't even like imagine. I'm
1:12:46
sorry. I'm sorry. It's like uh describing Disneyland and you haven't been there, right?
1:12:51
Yes. Yeah. Yes. I hope we can do justice on the words that we're going to say, right?
1:12:56
Yeah. This is like Whoa. Okay. So God just gave me so much vision for what he
1:13:03
has in store for 5F Church. My eyes opened up so much to like the five-fold
1:13:09
ministry in operation, the kingdom government operating in full effect. And
1:13:15
just to witness that was so powerful. It's like nothing I've ever seen. Just
1:13:20
the power of God, the fire of God, the way that he ministered. He had such
1:13:25
authority. I've never heard like a voice like that in my life. Like he had so
1:13:32
much authority as he walked through the crowds. So many demons were screaming like this was a thousand plus people
1:13:38
there. They were screaming all throughout. And he just free free. And
1:13:45
they were just had to go. They fleeed in his presence. And and God, you could
1:13:50
just see um how God was behind everything.
1:13:56
like we really stepped into the kingdom of God. We stepped into heaven on earth.
1:14:02
I am in shock. I'm still like it's still registering in me right now. But I could
1:14:07
feel also like this urgency that people need to know that this is a true prophet of God. I felt I felt what Apostle felt
1:14:15
when I I could imagine what she felt when she had witnessed God's power
1:14:20
moving and we how much we needed this in America. how rare this really is. That this this truly is a prophet who is
1:14:27
walking in highlevel anointing that we have not seen and it is astounding.
1:14:36
Um [Applause]
1:14:42
the fire of God was so intense as I went up and he prayed for me. He was holding my hand and I still fell back. I
1:14:49
couldn't stand in in the presence like I I was trembling the second that I got up
1:14:55
there. And then when he prayed for me for us after I we still I still couldn't
1:15:01
was trembling. I could feel his the heat. It felt as though there was a heat lamp over me even when I was sitting in
1:15:06
the front row. It was like intense heat. Um, and
1:15:14
just the shadow of the anointing as he was walking through, you could see like
1:15:19
as he walked by in his shadow, people were falling over
1:15:25
the love of God. I could feel so tangibly um because he he had he carried the just
1:15:31
such authority and like he was his servants respect and honor him like they
1:15:36
see in the spirit like this is God like this is God's move and they honor him
1:15:42
and and respect him and I could feel that reverence and awe and honor but
1:15:49
also the love of God. I just could feel his compassion. I could feel Jesus. I could see it in his eyes and it was just
1:15:57
so powerful. And I know that what he spoke, the words he declared over us are
1:16:04
going to come to pass. Like they already have. They already have. Like we are not the same. I will never be the same. And
1:16:12
I'm so excited and expecting for what God is going to do in this revival here in America and throughout the world.
1:16:19
And I have so much vision. I have so much vision and just like uh foresight
1:16:25
is the word. Is that the word? Like just v just just vision
1:16:30
um for what he has planned in the future and what he's already started. And I'm
1:16:37
just so grateful, Apostle Katherine, how you have like equipped us and you've
1:16:42
brought revival here to America and God has used you so powerfully. I'm so so
1:16:47
grateful. So many of our lives have changed all of us. We will never be the same because of this powerful anointing
1:16:53
that we've received. And I'm so grateful. I wouldn't even be standing here. As you guys can see, it's not my
1:16:59
gift to be speaking. So, it's G it's just Jesus helping me right
1:17:05
now. And I am so so so grateful. So, thank you so much.
1:17:11
Glory to God. Glory to God. So you guys know, I mean, do you notice
1:17:18
Christine can talk for hours now? That in itself, heaven on earth is probably the best way
1:17:25
to describe it. Um, I have a lot of notes, but Christine, thank you for
1:17:31
tackling a lot of them. But we got there, I kid you not, I think 4 days we
1:17:38
probably had 3 to four hours sleep. We were just under the anointing so thick.
1:17:43
And no matter like usually things that get me upset like my flights got super delayed. I wasn't upset. I was just I
1:17:50
love you. I was saying I love you too. I was like what's going on? Um there when
1:17:56
he was praying for me I did not know I have such deep pain. My parents came to
1:18:02
the United States during that time. I was like thinking I was like 15 years 15 years 15 years old. I'm 44. That's
1:18:11
that's deep. Um, and I was like looking at his eyes. I'm like, "What is it? What
1:18:17
is it?" And he his eyes were teary. Like I could see his eyes was like almost
1:18:23
crying with me. And you guys see me like cry all the time here like a baby. First
1:18:30
time haven't cried. Happiest person on earth. It's it's it's remarkable how his
1:18:37
power you cannot stand it. There is no way you can stand it. is so hot and you
1:18:42
feel this love and this warmth and this power that you cannot understand you.
1:18:50
I'm like telling Christine, "How can we describe it?" I'm like, "Well, all I can say is you guys have to go there." Like,
1:18:56
I kid you not, save your money. Go there tomorrow if you can. Cuz Christine's like, "Diane, we're going next month,
1:19:02
right?" I'm like, "Calm down. Calm down. I have a family. Come on." But um
1:19:10
um also like what he declared to be the happiest person on earth like how does he know my heart? So you guys know like
1:19:17
I've killed myself going after success and you know I tithe I I'm a good person
1:19:24
did all that lukewarm right and I I told apostle like revival now Portland I'm
1:19:30
like I don't want any money I don't want anything but just anything that keeps me satisfied and content in the Lord that's
1:19:38
all I want and guess what he said h be the happiest person on earth so praise
1:19:43
God for that I'm like just wow Wow, how do you know this? Thank you, God. And
1:19:49
then um ever since I got planted at 5F because I
1:19:55
don't want to get derailed in my walk with Jesus, I kept on journaling and
1:20:01
writing. I want to be a powerful vessel of you in any way. You can take anything. I don't care. I'm all yours. I
1:20:08
I look at my journal since December 2024. I wrote that 50 over 50 times. and
1:20:15
what he declared how I would bring a lot of people to Christ. Like how did how did he know that? Because he's a
1:20:22
prophet, guys. He's a prophet. And a major one that is um what I witness is
1:20:28
just remarkable. Like the shadow of the anointing. Think about Paul. Everybody will just flock in and try to just grab
1:20:35
his shoe, grab anything. And as he walks, everyone's like falling down. I'm
1:20:40
like, "Where's my camera? My camera." I'm like, "Where's my phone?" I couldn't even move cuz I was just like what's
1:20:46
going on right? All I want to say is how lucky we are or not lucky but blessed we
1:20:53
are that the anointing is here. So many people will go to heaven, but
1:21:00
but there's only a few people that will bring heaven to earth. And we're we have
1:21:08
our most love apostle here that brings
1:21:13
heaven to earth every single time. I'm like, my eyes were so open. I'm like, "Oh my gosh, how how how do I
1:21:20
deserve this?" like to see heaven on earth every single Sunday. Every single time at 3:00 sometimes I buy my plane
1:21:27
plane ticket at 1:00 a.m. I'm like, "Lord, I don't want to go." And the Lord says, "No, you're going. You have energy
1:21:33
now. You're going." Literally, I spend two to $3,000 a month to come here because this is heaven on earth. And the
1:21:40
happiest place on earth is not Disneyland World. It's 5F Church.
1:21:50
Um, am I missing anything? Let's see what else. Just amazing the entire trip. The
1:21:59
best trip of my life. Highly, highly encourage you. Don't go to Disneyland or
1:22:04
Paris or wherever. Go to Paris though. But go to Tanzania, Africa. The airport
1:22:10
is JRO, heaven on earth.
1:22:15
Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
1:22:21
Thank you for sharing. Thank you for sharing. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Yeah. There's
Message
1:22:29
such power in sewing. We receive all miracles from Jesus for free. There's no
1:22:35
transaction to receive miracles from God, to receive blessings. God gives every miracle freely.
1:22:44
But he has principles. His he has a principle many different principles. One of the important principles to have
1:22:50
abundant life and to prosper is to surrender your entire life to him which
1:22:56
includes obeying him. All that he's asking, he's not just asking for one thing. He's not just asking for you to
1:23:02
go to church. He's not just asking for you to read the Bible. He's asking you to come to church and be faithful and be
1:23:09
a real disciple and take the teaching seriously. He's asking you to read the
1:23:14
word with with with with with a with a heart to hear from God. Not just to check off the the the the check box on
1:23:21
your check off the box on your list of things duties you have to do to be a good Christian. And he asks you to give
1:23:29
too. It's all over the word where he asks us test me in this. Bring the tithe into the storehouse and see that I won't
1:23:36
pour out so many blessings. You don't have room for them all. Paul in the New
1:23:42
Testament, he says, "Thank you for giving. Thank you for supporting my ministry.
1:23:48
Now God will supply your every need in his glorious riches in Christ." But
1:23:54
he says that after he thanks the people for giving. Don't expect God to supply every need
1:24:00
when you're not surrendered to God in every way. Whether that's reading his word and being a true disciple, whether
1:24:07
that's being truly planted, not just treating church as something casual, or
1:24:13
whether that's being faithful in giving, in tithing. Amen. And there is such a
1:24:18
powerful revelation. I teach so much more on it on teachings on my YouTube. If you want to know more about sewing, if you want to learn more about the
1:24:26
power of sewing, I have teachings about sewing. If you type in sewing and my
1:24:32
name, you'll find it. You'll also find it on the Revival Army training playlist on my YouTube. This is so critical for
1:24:38
everyone who has become planted at 5F Church. Or if you're not planted, but you want to learn the new wine, the new
1:24:44
wine principles. Um, but there is so much power in giving generously to the
1:24:50
work of God, to God's kingdom, when the anointing is really present.
1:24:56
When the anointing is really present, because when you're giving, it is you making a sacrifice. That's not the only way we sacrifice. We also sacrifice with
1:25:02
our service to God. But it is a big way we sacrifice cuz God gives all of us money.
1:25:09
And and and if we don't become sacrificial with giving, then money will have a hold on us.
1:25:16
So that's a big reason why God asks us to be so generous. Many believers, they don't take it seriously giving
1:25:22
generously and they whine and complain about like pastors asking for people to give. But really, this is our job. This
1:25:29
is my job to teach you the power of sewing so that you can reap, so that you
1:25:35
can have abundance, you know. And so, um, it I it's really all of your life
1:25:42
that we must give to God. Our time, our energy, our gifts, our weaknesses, our
1:25:49
money, the the seeds that God has given us. Because we can either use our money selfishly or give it to God.
1:25:58
And a big way that God uh the a big way that that God
1:26:05
uses the the the offerings that come into the church is to expand his kingdom.
1:26:11
I've sh I've been real with you a lot of it's what is it here to rent this place is it's
1:26:18
what is it 10 10,000 10,000 around 10,000 and we we hire we
1:26:24
we have audio we have lighting we have cameras that's every week many of you know I've shared with you um
1:26:31
the different events we do some of them are more than $100,000 to do a twohour
1:26:36
event we're not trying to do anything over the top this is just to have a venue to hold people that's clean and
1:26:42
nice and up to God's standard so that people would actually want to come instead of being something rinky dinky.
1:26:49
Amen. So like to do the kingdom work is expensive.
1:26:55
So that's a big reason also it's for your heart that God wants you to give generously always but also because
1:27:02
there's a lot of work to do on this earth. King the heaven come for heaven to come to earth it costs money.
1:27:10
I mean to to actually do the work of God for us to be here today costs thousands of dollars for this work of God to come
1:27:17
forth. Amen. Many people they they they are so small-minded
1:27:23
and they listen to the devil's voice. Uh uh uh uh you know they people have
1:27:29
abused money. Ministers have abused money in the past and they listen to the devil's voice. Not every minister is
1:27:35
like that. Not every church is like that. And you you need to leave that in the past so that you can not be held
1:27:44
back anymore from not prospering in your life, from not having abundance in every area
1:27:49
because you're holding on to your seed and therefore you're not reaping. Amen.
1:27:55
So, you know, there's there's uh different cultures have different ways of doing
1:28:01
things, but there's powerful things that God releases that some some some cultures they become so uptight
1:28:08
religiously that you you can't even do things that God would like you to do
1:28:15
or do you have to go slowly because the people cannot are so rigid to receive. You see, you see what I
1:28:22
mean? But the people in Tanzania, the people in the Tanzania, they they do not have this religious spirit so strongly
1:28:28
that the people in America do. So they're able to freely receive different
1:28:34
revelations and grab them and apply them. And so sewing sewing the way they
1:28:40
do there, as I've been the many times I've seen it, I've I've done it myself. I've I've I've I've I've I've said yes,
1:28:47
that's beautiful what God's doing. I don't want to be prideful and American here and be like, "Oh, they're just they're just doing their own thing in
1:28:53
their culture." No, I'm going to humble myself and grab hold of this revelation
1:28:59
and and and and sew the way they're sewing. Amen. And so the there's a
1:29:04
revelation there um that that that has been released that the people have grabbed where when um when like the
1:29:12
ministers is ministering like prophet Jordi or if it's other apostles because the full fifold ministry is there
1:29:18
operating so many times apostles are teaching on a Sunday. Uh so whoever's
1:29:23
ministering when they are speaking a word and that word they want that word
1:29:29
to come to pass in their life. They want to grab hold of that word. They want that. They want to grab it. They want to
1:29:35
make it concrete. They've grabbed this spiritual principle of valuing the word to the extent of sacrifice, to the
1:29:42
extent of making an action. You want that word to come to pass in
1:29:48
your life. Not just a amen. We can all do that, right? Amen. Not that hard. Say
1:29:53
amen. Not much of a sacrifice to say amen. Don't get me wrong. We should say amen. But they've grabbed this this this
1:29:58
revelation. And this is what I'm explaining this to you cuz probably a lot of you are like, "What is she talking about?" She's talking about
1:30:03
giving offering throughout the service, sewing seeds upon this word that has
1:30:09
been released, saying, "I want that word for my life." And I I mean serious business about it. Lord, I know you see
1:30:16
me. I'm making a sacrifice right now. And and and I'm so grateful that that word was released over my life right
1:30:22
now. And sometimes this is just in the teaching. It's not just the that that's why it happens throughout the message that they're continually sewing seeds is
1:30:29
that it's during the teaching. Oh, that revelation I want that in my life. Ah, I
1:30:34
I want that word that was preached. That was a good word that I need. I don't want to miss that. I value this. I'm
1:30:41
making a sacrifice so I can really grab this and take it seriously. So that's why throughout the sermon even
1:30:47
even I've gone there and preached sometimes and as I'm preaching people will come and sew seeds. They sew the instead of the baskets, they'll sew
1:30:54
seeds on the um altar. That's what they do. So they'll sew seeds and it will be
1:30:59
glory to God. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. All glory to God.
1:31:05
Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Amen. Glory to God. Glory
1:31:13
to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Yes.
1:31:18
That's good to be humble. It's good to be humble. I'm telling you, because God
1:31:24
I'm telling you, God has released revelations and secrets of the kingdom
1:31:30
in in unlikely, humble, lowly places.
1:31:36
Just like Jesus was born in a manger, in a lowly place that was looked down
1:31:43
upon, that was looked at as poor. Just as Jesus was hidden in Africa by
1:31:50
God, Jesus lived in Africa for a time. Our Jesus lived in Africa. Egypt's in
1:31:59
Africa. God brought him to Africa.
1:32:04
I speak this because there's a lot of racism. There's a lot of ethnosentrism in America. It's real.
1:32:10
And not just America, around the world. And I've seen this. I mean, I've seen persecution towards my spiritual father.
1:32:15
embarrassing persecution towards me because of being a spiritual daughter of my spiritual father and honoring my spiritual father. And I got to be real,
1:32:22
a lot of it has to do with pride and ethnosentrism and racism. It's it's a part of it. Not
1:32:28
for everybody, but it's a part of it. It's really a part of it. That pride of we're the best, we know best, cuz we're
1:32:34
American, cuz we're white. It's there in some people. It is in the
1:32:40
body of Christ. It really is. I'm speaking the truth. Hallelujah.
1:32:46
It's really that that and I'm telling you that God has hidden he has hidden
1:32:52
precious secrets of the kingdom in humble lowly weak and foolish
1:33:00
places unlikely places
1:33:05
of great price. It's it's a secret of why of this
1:33:10
anointing. It's a secret of the power of this anointing that you experience in
1:33:16
your lives. These testimonies that we hear, it is not because God just decided to choose me and just speak to me
1:33:23
audibly and just use me without any vessel equipping me. No,
1:33:31
this anointing that I've received was impartation that I received from my spiritual father, prophet Dr. George
1:33:36
Davyy. Amen. This wisdom that I have gained has come
1:33:41
from God pouring out equipping and wisdom through my spiritual father.
1:33:50
This wisdom did not come on my own. This wisdom did not come from God to me directly. But there was a vessel
1:33:58
that God used. Hallelujah.
1:34:04
And so um I am so overjoyed today to
1:34:09
hear these testimonies. It's a desire of my heart. Many of you have seen a test maybe some of you have you've heard me
1:34:15
share a lot about my spiritual father and just
1:34:20
how I've been how it changed my life encountering God's power through him encountering the prophetic ministry
1:34:26
through him. How it opened up my eyes to God's love and power. And I was so I
1:34:31
love what Christine said. She was like, "There's this urgency that these people must know he's a real prophet."
1:34:38
Um, that is what has been my heart for years. It'll be nine years this
1:34:45
September when I first encountered him and he prophesied over my life that I was called to be an apostle. Um and so
1:34:52
for nine years that has been my heart because I had never I never had
1:34:58
encountered God's power in love like I had to this extent until I encountered
1:35:05
God moving through my spiritual father. He was the first prophet I have ever
1:35:11
encountered in my life. The first ministry I have received. And so, and
1:35:16
then God began to teach me about what he is doing through my spiritual father,
1:35:21
him prophesying, what God is doing in this revival.
1:35:26
And what makes this revival so powerful, so shocking. We have people planted from
1:35:34
164 nations and they are planted. They are literally choosing to come to 5F
1:35:39
Church instead of churches in their local community. But it's because they're experiencing real change and
1:35:45
transformation. And we want this in all churches. We want I there's pastors here I've heard
1:35:50
you've received you've come to receive impartation. I'm going to release his impartation to you. And I want your
1:35:56
churches to carry the same anointing. That's God's will.
1:36:02
Hallelujah. But it's rare. It's rare today. And so
1:36:07
we need to have a heart for for God's people to actually be equipped and transformed
1:36:14
rather than forcing them in religious constructs and forcing them to go to local churches just cuz you should go to
1:36:20
a local church, but they're not being transformed and they're not encountering the anointing. Amen. We need to have a heart for people to really be set free,
1:36:27
healed, and transformed. We need we have to have that. That's God's heart. Amen. So this is shocking.
1:36:34
And I'm still shocked every day. We have people planted from 164 nations. We have small groups in 46 places around the
1:36:40
whole world, even Russia and the Middle East. Glory to God. Um, and people,
1:36:46
these testimonies happening all the time. People experienced happiness. This woman experienced happiness for the
1:36:51
first time in her life. Glory to God. People being delivered and healed. So many miracles happening.
1:36:59
Why? Why is this taking place? It's because this is truly an ordained move of God.
1:37:07
Why? Why? Why was Moses doing so many signs, wonders, and miracles? Why?
1:37:13
Why? Because God was really with him. And it was a it was an ordained move of God. As simple as that. The fruits the
1:37:22
fruits tell it all. Amen. And and then secondarily why there is so
1:37:30
much fruits glory to God is because
1:37:36
myself and us we have come into alignment with God's plans and God's
1:37:41
will. We haven't bowed down. I haven't bowed down to men. You know a lot of people wanted me to minister a different
1:37:47
way. A lot of people wanted me to reject my spiritual father. Of course they did because the devil influenced them.
1:37:53
Because the devil is terrified of this anointing. He's terrified of apostles and prophets being restored.
1:38:01
He knows that if I disobey God by disconnecting myself from where I
1:38:06
received from my Elijah that the anointing would dry up in me. Devil knows that. So of course the devil tried
1:38:13
to influence people to try to get me to leave my spiritual father. Never. Get
1:38:19
behind me. Satan again and again and again I'll say hallelujah
1:38:25
hallelujah hallelujah but I have not and we have not bowed
1:38:32
down to men there's a lot of people there's a lot of even ministers that
1:38:37
want me to cast out demons the way they cast out demons that want me to minister the way that they minister that want me
1:38:44
to become their spiritual daughter maybe they can take credit or something you know things like this I've faced that
1:38:52
but I've said no I will only obey God
1:38:59
and and that in so what God is doing in this revival what makes this revival
1:39:05
different and more powerful even than the past revival is that God is restoring the five-fold
1:39:11
ministry he is restoring according to Ephesians 2:20 apostles and prophets are
1:39:17
the foundation of the church with Christ Jesus as a chief cornerstone. This is
1:39:23
New Testament. The church is alive. It's not dead. The church is alive.
1:39:30
If we need living pastors today, then we certainly need a living foundation. How
1:39:36
much more important is the foundation to be alive? Apostles and prophets to be alive. God needs to use living apostles
1:39:44
and prophets as vessels to move through. And so a big secret of why the fruits,
1:39:53
why the anointing is so powerful, glory to God, is because we are doing things
1:39:58
God's way. God has spoken. I am restoring the five-fold ministry. I am restoring the ministry of apostles and
1:40:05
prophets. But you know what? So many people with their religiousness, they say, "Why you call yourself an apostle?
1:40:12
I don't even want to listen because I'm offended. You call yourself an apostle. Other
1:40:20
people they comment day and night no more apostles.
1:40:27
There are no more apostles. And then so many people they hear
1:40:33
prophet prophet is probably false. This is the devil. The devil knows the
1:40:42
power of the church being strong, having a strong foundation.
1:40:50
Then the believers won't be deceived by the devil anymore. They will be equipped. They will be strong. They will
1:40:58
be victorious. And they will walk in the anointing. And they will cast out demons. They will
1:41:04
heal the sick. And the kingdom of God will be unstoppable. Will destroy every
1:41:10
work of the devil. No wonder apostles and prophets face the most persecution. No wonder the devil
1:41:18
tried to bury apostles and prophets. Tried to blind people of what's in the
1:41:23
Bible in the New Testament. When it speaks about Agabus, when it speaks about Silas, when it talks about
1:41:29
Barnabas, all of these are prophets. New Testament prophets.
1:41:35
When we look at our example in the acts church in the New Testament, we are seeing ministry of apostles. What should
1:41:42
church look like? Well, I don't know. I think I should just look and see what they do today. No, we should look at the
1:41:47
Bible. There was apostles who were sent out to begin the work of God.
1:41:55
This is our description. And you read the book of Acts and you find what the church is supposed to look like. They
1:42:01
were devoted to the teachings of the apostles, but they've rewritten, many people have rewritten it today in their
1:42:07
minds. It's like the the the devil, the angel of light or something's coming in their mind saying they devoted themselves to the teaching of the
1:42:12
pastors and and and and constantly it's saying
1:42:19
signs and wonders and miracles they were in awe of. Constantly is saying the demons were cast out, the sick were
1:42:25
healed. People are not reading their Bibles today. They are they are listening to the angel of light when they read their
1:42:31
Bibles today. And so anyways, I we've had to choose. I've had to choose. We have had to
1:42:38
choose to not bow to man. When they when they reject me, when they reject us
1:42:43
because we are obedient to embrace apostles and prophets. When we are obedient to embrace not any apostles and
1:42:49
prophets, but God's chosen prophets and apostles unashamely.
1:42:54
unashamedly not caring if so much persecution comes to us because we honor and acknowledge a
1:43:01
true prophet of God, a true apostle of God. That's one of the big secrets of
1:43:07
why there's so many fruits here. We are not I am not doing things my way. I am
1:43:12
very careful to be in the will of God, to be doing exactly what God wants. And I say that humbly. I'm very careful to
1:43:19
be asking my spiritual father constantly questions to make sure I'm in the will of God. To be taking holding on to his
1:43:25
every word as if it's the word of God because it is the word of God. And it says in the word, it says in the word
1:43:32
that this is the New Testament. New Testament it says this when you receive
1:43:39
a prophet as a prophet. Another translation says I think it's NLT. says, "When you receive a prophet as a man, as
1:43:46
a servant that is speaking for God, you shall receive a prophet's reward."
1:43:58
That reward has to do with prosperity, abundance life. I'm not talking about prosperity in finances only, but is
1:44:03
finances, too. I'm talking about abundance. As it says in 2 Chronicles 20:20 is it says, "Believe in prophets
1:44:11
and you shall prosper." Believe in God and you shall be established. It says, "Believe in prophets and you shall
1:44:17
prosper." Believe in God and you shall be established. Meaning your name will be
1:44:23
written in the Lamb's book of life. You will be saved. You will go to heaven when you believe in God. But the word
1:44:29
established means begin. your life with God begins. Your your your your your life as a child of God begins. But if
1:44:37
you want to prosper, if you want to advance to the next level, if you want to have abundant life, you need to
1:44:43
believe the words of the prophets, you need to believe the prophetic words
1:44:48
coming through apostles, God's servants as well. Amen. And so so much I mean it was revival is
1:44:55
now was prophesied by my spiritual father, prophet George Davey. He's the one that prophesied that revival is now. He is the one also that prophesied that
1:45:01
I'm an apostle. I wanted to be a singer. I did not want to be a minister at all. Not even 0.000000001%.
1:45:09
I want to be a minister. So I am only here and we are only here.
1:45:15
And glory to God your lives have only been changed and touched because I believed in the I believed in the
1:45:21
prophets. I received a prophet as a prophet
1:45:28
and you have too as you've come with humility as you come not listening to
1:45:33
the Pharisees but instead you've come humbly you you receive the words that I say glory to
1:45:39
God you see you look for yourself and you see fruits you shall know them by their fruits and so when I share my
1:45:45
testimony about the true prophet that prophesied these things you can humbly receive it
1:45:51
so I thank you for standing with me and standing with God, not bowing to man and
1:45:58
but only fearing God and receiving God's ways for his revival for this move to
1:46:06
receive apostles and prophets. It's a new thing he's doing. It is not new
1:46:12
meaning it's in the Bible. We are doing the Bible more than most churches.
1:46:18
[Applause] I say this humbly, like real. Read the
1:46:26
book of Acts if you don't believe me. Most churches aren't casting out demons, aren't healing the sick. Most churches
1:46:33
aren't embracing apostles and prophets and the five-fold ministry.
1:46:41
Glory to God. Glory to God. So
1:46:46
I I rejoice today for I see spiritual eyes being opened up
1:46:54
being opened up to the truth to the truth that the devil is the most
1:47:02
terrified of. The devil persecutes what he is the most
1:47:07
terrified of. The devil persecutes what he is the most terrified of.
1:47:19
I repeat, the devil persecutes what he is most terrified of.
1:47:29
So it's it's time for believers to no longer be deceived anymore. When you come with a humble heart and
1:47:36
you see God, you can see God. The pure in heart shall see God. So to come with
1:47:41
a humble heart, that is how to actually see God and actually see the truth. When
1:47:47
you come with a skeptical heart, you'll miss God and the devil will easily deceive you.
1:47:54
That's what happened in the times of Jesus. The Pharisees were blinded by their pride.
1:48:01
They were so blinded that they couldn't even see God Almighty in Jesus.
1:48:08
The most precious, unconditional, forgiving, compassionate love that's ever touched this earth was right before
1:48:16
them. Not only did they not see it, they said it was the devil.
1:48:23
Pride blinds you. So this is a great
1:48:30
wisdom for you to have. If you are sensing pride in you,
1:48:36
you are losing your spiritual eyesight. If you are sensing pride in you, you are
1:48:43
allowing the devil to blind you. If you were sensing pride in you,
1:48:51
the devil could even say this is God and it's not. Or this is the devil when it's actually
1:48:57
God. So the best thing to do when you're sensing pride in you is to repent and
1:49:04
plead with God to help you. Plead with God to help you. That this is
1:49:10
the most serious thing in the world you should desire more than anything is to be rid of pride
1:49:16
because pride is the only thing that can derail you and make you blind and make
1:49:22
you think you're hearing God's voice, but you're being led by the devil. Pride is the most dangerous thing in the
1:49:27
world. So that's why I say you should desire humility above all else. Purity and
1:49:33
heart above all else. If you sense pride in you, this is 911 emergency. You need to treat it as
1:49:42
seek God with all your heart. Help me Lord. I'm sensing pride.
1:49:47
Help me be humble. Help me Lord. I never want to miss you. I never want to be the
1:49:54
Pharisees that miss you. accuse you falsely and persecute you.
1:50:02
And the next best thing you should do is shut your mouth. Don't put your mouth on servants of God
1:50:09
when the devil's when the devil's telling you that they're from the devil or something.
1:50:15
[Applause] If you sense pride, you got to know,
1:50:21
"Oh, I can't see very well spiritually. Now is not the time to blasphemy the
1:50:26
Holy Spirit. Now is not the time to speak
1:50:32
as if I know because I'm blinding myself with this pride. But the problem is is many people with pride, they they they
1:50:38
don't want to be real with themselves. But I'm telling you, when you make this intention that
1:50:46
humility and purity and heart is the most important thing in the world to you, you will never become prideful. Prideful will pride pride will never
1:50:52
have a hold on you. But you got to make it your intention the greatest desire of
1:50:57
your heart to be pure in heart.
1:51:04
One thing I've learned about God is that when your desire is to be in his will, you will be in his will. He's so good.
1:51:13
But the problem is many people don't want his will. They say they do, but they haven't surrendered everything.
1:51:20
They they were like, "Well, let me just tiptoe outside sometimes." But I'm mostly in just a just a taste.
1:51:32
But if that's the case, that's not really your intention to that's not really your intention to
1:51:40
have a pure heart, be humble, be surrendered fully, and you can be deceived. But if it's truly your
1:51:46
intention and you've made it your desire despite your feelings, you've made it your desire,
1:51:52
you will be in God's will every day. You will hear God's voice. You will see God wants you to be in his will more than
1:51:59
you do. So, he will move heaven and earth to make sure you're in his will.
1:52:05
He will open up supernatural doors and close doors to make sure you're in his
1:52:10
will. He will move mountains. He will do anything to get you the message you need to hear. If you need to hear a message,
1:52:17
hallelujah. Praise God. [Applause]
1:52:25
So, the Holy Spirit um led me to begin preaching a topic I didn't plan,
1:52:33
but his ways are perfect. His ways are best. Hallelujah.
Message
1:52:39
Hallelujah. But I'm going to begin teaching a little bit and then we're going to finish next week this message
1:52:45
about um the greatest in the kingdom.
1:52:51
Luke 22:24 and it's going along with the prelude here. It was an intro. Truly,
1:52:59
Holy Spirit's amazing. Luke 22:24. When they began to argue among
1:53:04
themselves about who would be the greatest among them, Jesus told them, "In this world, the kings and great men
1:53:11
lorded over their people. Yet they are called friends of the people. But among you, it will be different. Those who are
1:53:17
the greatest among you should take the lowest rank, and the leader should be like a servant. Who is more important?
1:53:24
The one who sits at the table or the one who serves?" The one who sits at the table, of course, but not here. For I am
1:53:31
among you as one who serves.
1:53:39
I'm going to read that this in the Passion translation um starting at 25.
1:53:44
The kings and men of authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects claiming that they do it for
1:53:49
the good of the people. They are obsessed with how others see them. But this is not your calling. You will lead
1:53:57
by a different model. The greatest one among you has a servant
1:54:03
heart. The leaders who are served are the most important in your eyes. But in
1:54:09
the kingdom, it is the servants who lead.
1:54:16
We're going to go to Mark 9:33. Uh,
1:54:22
no, Mark 9:34. Well, actually 33. We're going to Jesus said, "What are you arguing about on the
1:54:28
way here?" He says to the disciples, no one said a word because they had been arguing about which one of them was the
1:54:33
greatest. Jesus sat down, called the 12 disciples to come around to him and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first,
1:54:40
he must be content to be last and become a servant to all."
1:54:49
So the greatest in the kingdom, the absolute greatest in the kingdom are
1:54:54
those who are servants, who have servant hearts, who put others before them, who
1:54:59
live selfless lives, humble lives, those are the greatest. And you cannot fool
1:55:08
God. God sees your motives. God sees your heart.
1:55:15
He sees servant hearts and the Bible says that he will exalt
1:55:24
those who humble themselves. Matthew 23:11-12, "The greatest among you must be a servant, but those who exalt
1:55:30
themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted." How are they exalted? By God.
1:55:37
God sees when your heart is pure, is humble, has a is servant, servant heart.
1:55:44
And he will lift you for his glory. He will lift you in a place of leadership
1:55:50
where you can be an example for others to imitate as you imitate Jesus. That's the meaning
1:55:57
of being exalted is that you are exalted into a place of leadership to lead
1:56:03
people to Christ. You may be exalted into a place of more
1:56:08
influence for the purpose of leading people to Christ
1:56:13
because God sees you do not care about yourself. You only care about God. You
1:56:20
have a servant heart through and through. So now he can entrust you with his people. He knows he can count on you
1:56:28
to not do things in a selfish manner, to do things in your own gain. But because
1:56:35
your heart is a servant heart through and through, he can trust you. So he
1:56:41
lifts you and he leads other people, more people
1:56:46
to look at you, to see your example, to learn from you, to receive the anointing
1:56:52
through you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:56:59
Um there's many people, many believers,
1:57:06
they really want to be a minister. They really want to start a church. They really want to be a worship leader. They
1:57:13
really want to have a leadership position in the church, in ministry in some way. They feel this deep in their
1:57:21
heart. For a lot of people, there's a mixture. For a lot of people, they love God and
1:57:29
they really are excited about serving him. They may have a gifting. They may have a teaching gifting. They may have
1:57:35
what they think is a leadership gifting, a natural inclination to lead. They may have a musical gifting. They may have
1:57:42
whatever kind of gifting. And they feel very zealous to use that gifting. And they feel very zealous to
1:57:50
serve God. But a lot of believers,
1:57:56
I would say probably the majority that are having these feelings, these passions, this excitement
1:58:03
also have some selfish ambitions mixed in
1:58:11
because you have to be sanctified and transformed into the image of God to get rid of your old self completely. And one
1:58:20
of the big um one of the big components every person has before they give their
1:58:26
life to Jesus is selfishness.
1:58:33
That that you you you can't be you you cannot be selfish without Jesus
1:58:40
without without surrendering your life to Jesus.
1:58:45
And so when you give your life to Jesus, there's parts of the soul that have to be transformed.
1:58:51
There's certain weaknesses. Some people they have an inclination to be angry. They may not have a spirit of anger, but
1:58:56
maybe they just have an that's part a weak part of their flesh where they they get angry or they get anxious or they get to they get sad easily.
1:59:04
Just components in your soul that simply needs to be transformed by God. And you
1:59:11
do that by soaking in his anointing, soaking in his word, renewing your mind,
1:59:18
applying all the principles that God has given. the big ones such as
1:59:24
being a true disciple by planting yourself where God has called you to be planted, valuing the teachings, valuing
1:59:30
the word of God written and spoken with all of your heart
1:59:36
and serving wherever the need is and contributing to the kingdom of God. Seowing these different principles as
1:59:42
you continually do these things, this is the main way that transformation comes.
1:59:47
As you continually obey God, deny your flesh, make sacrifice, God transforms
1:59:54
you to be less selfish until you are selfless.
2:00:00
But that doesn't come overnight. And so so many people, they carry that selfishness. So many believers carry
2:00:06
that selfishness that they had in their past life, in their believer life.
2:00:14
And it's so important that you all are aware of this, that you don't look the other way. But it's it's important
2:00:20
you're real with yourself about your motives because if you're not, you can be you can be led by the angel of light.
2:00:27
I'll tell you a big scheme of the devil. He loves to hijack believers that have
2:00:33
such great potential to be used mightily by God. He loves to hijack them
2:00:41
in the middle of their pride and selfishness.
2:00:46
He loves people that are are not patient, but they just want to quick serve God in a highlevel way and having
2:00:53
their own ministry. He the devil, this is a big scheme of the devil to speak sounding like God. go start a ministry
2:01:00
now or get mad when you're not being promoted into a leadership position or
2:01:06
something and leave the church or be jealous of the leader
2:01:13
because you want leadership and you're not getting it. So be jealous of them and then start being a Pharisee towards
2:01:19
them.
2:01:24
Most of the persecution that happens is jealousy. That's what happened with the Pharisees. The Pharisees were the
2:01:30
religious leaders. They were the top dogs in the church world back then, the church world.
2:01:36
They had the big congregations. There was no competition. Jesus comes
2:01:42
and he's walking in the mighty anointing.
2:01:48
People's lives are being transformed. People are left in awe and wonder. People being healed and delivered.
2:01:54
And that's not happening in their services. their services are dry.
2:02:02
And this is literally written in the word. It's literally in the Bible where I believe it's Pilate that recognizes a
2:02:08
jealousy. He says they want to kill Jesus, but it's really just jealousy.
2:02:14
Like he saw it for what it was. So that's the main reason of persecution today is um what it the main the main
2:02:22
persecution of Jesus was the Pharisees was the religious leaders
2:02:28
and today it tends to be people who are ministers or who want to be ministers or
2:02:33
who want power in the church world in some way maybe a worship leader or
2:02:38
something like that they want some leadership position and then there's jealousy towards
2:02:45
ministers called by God who are walking in anointing. And so that comes from the devil. That's
2:02:51
why I say this is the big scheme of the devil to hijack people with great potential to be mighty vessels of God
2:02:59
with their precious gifting God gave them in their mother's womb and then the anointing that will come upon that such
2:03:05
potential. The devil sees it. And so the easiest thing for the devil to do to try to to to to hijack them away from God's
2:03:13
plan for their life is by being pretending to be God. Oh yeah, your
2:03:19
gifting is so great. Yeah, you need to use it. Time's a wasting. Go start a
2:03:24
ministry before God's time before you have been transformed. I'm telling you, for you to be exalted by
2:03:32
God, exalted to the place of leadership, exalted to the place of being a minister
2:03:38
where lives are entrusted to you,
2:03:43
you have to have a servant heart through
2:03:48
and through. Now, there's a lot of self-appointed ministers. There's a lot of people who
2:03:53
weren't actually called by God. I'm talking about God's true ways. If you want to be truly called by God in God's
2:04:00
will, a true minister of God, you have to be transformed so greatly. Your heart
2:04:08
has to be molded to be a servant heart through and through. And guess what?
2:04:14
That does not happen overnight. No matter what,
2:04:20
maybe your past wasn't that great. You grew up in the church. you think you can just excel faster. You have to go
2:04:29
through a process no matter what to have this servant heart transformed in you.
2:04:38
And sometimes if your past wasn't that bad, sometimes there can be pride.
2:04:44
Sometimes you it might take you longer that person longer to be transformed to have a servant heart
2:04:50
rather than someone like Paul who sees how much he needed God's grace
2:04:59
and is living in that revelation. Who am I to be chosen by God?
2:05:04
Jesus, I need you. Amen. Amen.
2:05:12
Hallelujah. Jesus appeared to my spiritual father, Prophet Dr. George Davey. Um,
2:05:20
in the early 2000s, was it 20 2004, 2005? Anyone remember?
2:05:25
2004. 2004, Jesus appeared to my spiritual father. Before that time, I
2:05:32
think it was four something years ago. Before that, before that he had been
2:05:38
pastoring a church of Messiah tribal people mostly of hundred and something
2:05:46
and this was in his living room. I believe it would expand outside but for
2:05:51
four something years he was being faithful to minister to them.
2:05:57
And before that he was had been faithful to God for many many many years serving
2:06:03
God serving God in music ministry serving God he was in YW wham as well
2:06:08
and then in 2004 right before he was about to minister at a conference Jesus appeared to him in
2:06:16
the early hours of the morning Jesus it was like from here up and Jesus was
2:06:22
holding a bunch of keys and he shook the keys
2:06:28
And he says to he says to prophet Jordi he says I'm giving you the keys to
2:06:35
unlock my people from bondage from religious bondage.
2:06:45
Hallelujah. And these keys represented religion. The
2:06:50
chains of religion. These these keys had different names on the keys. Some of them, many of them were different
2:06:56
denominations. Other names on these keys. Prophet Jordi had never seen these names before. But
2:07:03
there were all these different ways that people had been held back from religious doctrines of the devil.
2:07:11
And so he with with the biggest smile that exuded the most love that Prophet Javi had ever seen in his life, Jesus
2:07:18
then vanished. and he went to minister at that conference that day and all of a sudden
2:07:26
the spiritual realm opened up. He could see this person, God wants him to get
2:07:32
out of the wheelchair and walk right now. Get out of your wheelchair. And he got up and walked. And it was just like
2:07:38
popcorn. He could suddenly see so much in the spiritual realm.
2:07:45
So much. And so many miracles were happening instantly.
2:07:50
Prophets are called by birth. And prophets, they're called by birth. Like Jeremiah, I knew you in your mother's
2:07:56
wombs. I've called you to be a prophet to the nations. That's still how God moves today. And at when he was a young
2:08:01
child, he would speak things and they would happen. He would say to a bus driver one time
2:08:07
when he was very young, there's something coming up ahead, like I think a car coming in the wrong lane or
2:08:13
something like that. He spoke this and he you couldn't see it at all. It was like and then all of a sudden it came
2:08:18
and the bus driver was able was able to veer out of the way and other things like that happened. And when God
2:08:25
revealed when when when Jesus opened his eyes and said, "I've called you to be a prophet." And now he could see all of
2:08:31
this in the spiritual realm. His mother reminded him of when he was a young child. These instances that that that
2:08:38
confirmed he was a prophet. And so from that day they the the
2:08:46
revival broke out at his church and in Tanzania and his church grew to I think it was
2:08:54
from like a few hundred or something to 1,000 in one year.
2:09:01
A couple hundred to like 1,000 in one year I believe. Something like that
2:09:06
because of the fruits, because of all the miracles happening. And now his church, as you heard today, has several
2:09:12
thousands every Sunday. The president of Tanzania
2:09:18
speaks with him very frequently, seeking spiritual advice, respecting him as a
2:09:24
true prophet of God, and just knowing how the the the the country really
2:09:30
receives him as a prophet of God, honors him. And so seeing this wisdom in in
2:09:35
there being peace in the country by by seeking his spiritual advice.
2:09:41
Glory to God. Um but I say all that to say there was
2:09:48
years where God was molding his servant heart before all this happened. I
2:09:53
remember him he he told me the story about how he went to YWAM and he was young at that time. It was like in the
2:09:59
'8s and I think he was probably like a teenager at that time. But he said all these ministers came there. They came to
2:10:04
be trained in ministry but they were already ministers. They were already bishops. They were already these these ministers. They were worship leaders.
2:10:11
And the rule at that YWAM he says he remembers to this day. And this rule was
2:10:17
that you must lay down everything and become a servant.
2:10:27
lay down your position and learn. You are here to learn. And he said, "A lot
2:10:33
of people, they left because they wanted recognition. They wanted honor. They were used to getting that recognition as
2:10:39
a minister, but they go there and they couldn't take it. They would be assigned to wash dishes. They would be assigned
2:10:45
to clean, to cook, and they would get offended. How come they can't give me a chance to preach
2:10:52
just one time?" they would get offended and leave. But he said, "I had no
2:10:57
problem with it because I wanted to be transformed. I wanted to be transformed by God's
2:11:02
word." And so he says, "I was a he was he was very gifted at music. He was a worship
2:11:08
leader at the time." He's like, "I just laid it down. I didn't play guitar for a year. I didn't touch it.
2:11:14
I focused completely on being a servant. That's what they told me to do.
2:11:23
For me, God called me to be an apostle.
2:11:29
And it was 4 and a half years after receiving this prophecy. It was September of 2016 that I received this
2:11:36
prophecy that I was called to be an apostle. But God did not entrust me to be a
2:11:42
shepherd of more than a handful of people for four and a half years.
2:11:49
similar timing as my spiritual father before his eyes opened up and revival broke out
2:11:56
and thousands started coming to his ministry. It was years of me
2:12:04
gaining a servant heart, a servant heart being transformed, molded in me
2:12:11
before God could entrust me to this highlevel place of leadership.
2:12:17
It didn't happen overnight. And I had been a Christian my whole life, but it didn't happen overnight.
2:12:28
I remember when um my my spiritual father when he came here
2:12:35
to minister, I hosted him at a conference and um this is this was a
2:12:40
conference where he prophesied that revival is now where God has heard America's prayers and cries for revival
2:12:46
and he has answered them. I didn't know he was going to prophesy that there, but I knew a true prophet of God was
2:12:52
coming to my city. And you know, I was so just in awe.
2:12:59
Their testimonies remind me so much, Christine and Diane, because I was just like, the world has to know.
2:13:07
Like, there's a true prophet of God that I haven't seen before. I haven't ever
2:13:13
encountered God's power and love like this before in my life. the world needs to know. I want the world to experience what I've
2:13:20
experienced because it set me on fire for Jesus like never before. Through the prophetic ministry of a
2:13:25
prophet, my eyes open up to God's love and nearness for me like never before.
2:13:35
Before my whole life as a believer, I was a believer my whole life. Earliest memory is giving my life to Jesus age
2:13:40
four. I always loved God. I always believed God loved me. But I believed it. It was like, "Yes, I believe. I
2:13:46
believe cuz people tell me." But when I encountered the ministry, the prophetic
2:13:52
ministry, the prophetic words spoken to me through a prophet, through my spiritual father, Prophet Joe Davyy.
2:14:00
I now knew God loves me so much.
2:14:06
I now knew God was close to me always. I now knew God cared about every detail of
2:14:13
my life. I now knew God had perfect, beautiful plans for my life.
2:14:19
It was this intense knowing like hearing about somebody. Maybe
2:14:25
somebody tells you, "Oh, you have this family member and they love you so much and this person tells you all about
2:14:32
them." So you believe, you have no reason to doubt and you even love them for hearing, "Oh, they love me." Right?
2:14:39
If you can imagine that, if you have a family member you never met and and have done their family member tells you this, just imagine, you know, but then you
2:14:46
meet them and all that they say is true, but their words did no justice.
2:14:53
That's what it's like meeting Jesus through the power of God, through the
2:15:00
prophetic ministry. Glory to God. The fire of God is here. Hallelujah.
2:15:08
Hallelujah. And so I was like, I know God is so
2:15:14
good. I know God is so faithful. I know God loves me. I know his plans for me
2:15:20
are so good. And I was just that way through a simple prophetic ministry.
2:15:26
But I I went my whole life as a believer not experiencing that.
2:15:32
That's why I had so much zeal for the body of Christ. That's and and I share this also to help your eyes open up to
2:15:39
see why we need prophets and why we need apostles, why we need the prophetic ministry because we're
2:15:44
missing so much without it. Amen. But when I when I um hosted my spiritual
2:15:51
father here in LA, the the conference where he prophesied the revival is now God started speaking to me about the
2:15:59
importance of serving God and what that looks like. Being a servant to all. This
2:16:04
means putting people before you. And how this looks how this looks so much is
2:16:12
serving the work of God. Being a servant looks like putting
2:16:18
people before you in your own life. It doesn't mean like opening up doors to
2:16:24
the wrong people and letting them abuse you. No. But I mean like to the people
2:16:31
God has called you to. friendships and and family members
2:16:37
and even maybe just having a conversation with somebody in the hair salon or in the airplane seat next to
2:16:44
you, but that in that moment you would be a servant to them.
2:16:50
You wouldn't think about your plans, your ambitions, what you plan to do that day, but you would recognize God in this
2:16:58
divine appointment that's happening right now, God is calling me to serve them by loving them, by uh loving them
2:17:05
in different ways, actively through your words, smiling, just shining the love of
2:17:11
Jesus. Sometimes that could mean just helping someone. When you see some a stranger or something needs help, you go run. You're
2:17:18
a servant. I'm a servant. This is who I am.
2:17:23
Practically, you know, when when God started speaking this to me at the time when I would hang when I
2:17:30
would hang out with people, when I would hang out with friends, I would try to find practical ways that I could serve
2:17:36
others, that I could deny myself, that I could be selfless. And so I would say I
2:17:41
would I would say, "Where do you want to go to eat for dinner, for lunch?" practical ways
2:17:49
where I'm denying myself and practicing being a servant because that's what I'm
2:17:54
called to to be a servant. So if I want to be a servant, I have to act like it.
2:17:59
I have to practice it. I have to make the intention. I have to see others that they matter more than me.
2:18:07
I have to see others that they need to know the love of God through the service here right now.
2:18:13
That's one of the ways we're called to be servants. But the other another way we're called to be a servant is by
2:18:19
is by um serving the work of God.
2:18:26
Serving the work of God like Elisha who served Elijah.
2:18:33
It says in first Kings 19:19 Elijah went from there
2:18:40
and found Elisha. He was plowing with 12 yolk of oxin and he himself was driving with 12th pair. Elijah went up to him
2:18:45
and threw his cloak around him. Verse 21, he took his yolk of oxin and
2:18:50
slaughtered them. This is this is a picture of him leaving behind his own life and committing to follow Elijah
2:18:57
because Elijah had just called him prophetically. You were called to be my servant. Follow me and be a spiritual
2:19:02
son. This is what God is saying as a prophet. I speak this to you is what Elijah was doing by throwing the cloak
2:19:08
on Elisha. And so then Elisha says he burned him the plowing equipment. He burned the
2:19:14
plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became
2:19:20
his servant. He became his servant.
2:19:29
Elijah was a prophet of God. Elijah was doing the most mighty works for God at
2:19:35
the time. He was this major prophet, highlevel prophet. God had chosen him
2:19:42
and God was doing such wonders through him. But we are called to be the body of
2:19:48
Christ. We we need to all contribute to the work of God. And God has order. He doesn't
2:19:55
assign us all to do our own works. But he calls us to be united and to work
2:20:00
together towards the same vision, towards the same assignment.
2:20:06
So instead of God calling Elisha, Elisha, you're going to be a powerful prophet like Elijah. So now just start
2:20:13
trying to do what Elijah does. So now just start ministering. No, that's not what happened. God said
2:20:22
you're going to be like Elijah. This is the calling for your life. So in order for you to step into that calling, you
2:20:28
have to learn how to be a servant
2:20:34
because every believer, every servant of God,
2:20:40
their role is a servant. My role is a servant.
2:20:46
Right now I am serving you. yesterday as I prepared this message
2:20:53
amidst it deadlines. I'm writing a new book. Glory to God. I'm so excited. I'm
2:20:59
so excited for what God's gonna do this book. Amidst deadlines and busyiness of other works of God, I am sacrificing and
2:21:06
denying myself to prepare this message to hear from the Holy Spirit for your
2:21:12
life for you to be fed this word. Amen. As I pray for you, I am serving you.
2:21:24
Everything that I do for the work of God, I am serving you.
2:21:29
I don't do anything for my own gain. I don't do anything for selfish ambition, for the grace and glory of God.
2:21:36
I'm doing it because God has asked me to serve you.
2:21:42
And so to be a minister, to be a leader in any capacity in ministry, you have to
2:21:50
be a servant, a real servant.
2:21:56
Glory to God. And so this servant heart is shaped by
2:22:04
like Elijah. He was serving God's people. And Elisha has the calling to serve God's people. like Elijah. Well,
2:22:10
he first has to learn how to serve.
2:22:16
And Elijah was doing great things for God. He needed help. He needed help.
2:22:24
There was a time I was editing all the videos that were posted. But we couldn't I couldn't put out many
2:22:30
video that many videos because it was all me doing it. Now we have a whole editing team. Glory to God.
2:22:37
and I'm doing no editing now. I would not be able to write the book
2:22:43
that I'm writing right now. I would not be able to do the ecourse that I just did that will be coming on the fall. Glory to God. I wouldn't be able to be
2:22:50
doing that. I wouldn't be able to doing the other things that I'm doing for the work of God that God is calling me to
2:22:56
without people having servant hearts being like Elisha and becoming a servant
2:23:02
to the work of God, serving the anointing.
2:23:07
There are tons of people who serve in all these different areas from worship to the media team to the ushers to
2:23:14
behind the scenes. There's so many people who are serving here and because they are serving more work of God forth,
2:23:24
but they're all aligned. They're not like, "Oh, I'm going to start my own ministry.
2:23:29
Oh, because that's what people feel like so much, but it's not God's calling.
2:23:35
It's actually God's calling for them. Maybe it's a God's calling for them to be a minister in God's timing to be a
2:23:40
branch leader of that church where you're a part of or maybe to start your own ministry in God's timing. Maybe.
2:23:48
But what he's calling everyone to first is to focus on serving the work of God.
2:23:55
Serving where you are planted, where you have received from. Because God is about
2:24:02
unity and the same vision. Hallelujah.
2:24:07
We cannot be scattered doing our own things. We have to come together and we
2:24:14
have to come in order. We have to see what we can do to take off the the the
2:24:19
loads of of the work of God of the servants of God.
2:24:24
When God started giving me this revelation, my spiritual father came here for the conference that I'm telling you about where he prophesied the
2:24:31
revival is now. And when I when I was preparing for him to go come, I just treated it like so seriously like this
2:24:38
is what God how God is calling me to be a servant right now. I need to just make sure everything is smooth and I serve
2:24:45
him with excellence. Just everything that I take care of like like booking a hotel, like the right hotel, like make
2:24:51
sure it's it's good. It's clean. It's nice. Uh picking them up in the airport,
2:24:57
the car, like all these different arrangements, the preparing of the conference. I would go out and hand out
2:25:04
flyers so many nights. I put a magnet of the conference on my car. I I when he came,
2:25:12
I was serving with such trying to serve with such excellence because I knew this is what God had
2:25:18
called me to. I knew I knew he was doing such important work and my role in this
2:25:25
time was to try to alleviate any possible heaviness, stress, unnecessary
2:25:32
burdens and just do what I can to make sure everything goes smoothly and peacefully.
2:25:38
Little did I know he was carrying a word like Moses that would change the world.
2:25:43
revival is now, you know, and so I I had this heart of I
2:25:49
like what he's doing is so powerful. I want to protect this anointing. I want
2:25:56
to protect the peace. I want I I just want him to be able to focus on doing the work of God because this is so
2:26:03
important what he's doing. So, I'm going to do anything I can to help in that, to
2:26:09
help him do that with peace.
2:26:15
with strength. Amen. Glory to God.
2:26:22
So God is is is saying to you right now, you many of you, you you have great
2:26:29
potential to be used powerfully by God.
2:26:35
But you have to become a servant. Drop it. Drop your ambitions. Drop your good
2:26:42
ambitions because you have to be a servant first. It is not going to be overnight.
2:26:49
Stop thinking so much of your ambitions, of your ministry ambitions, and lay them
2:26:56
down so God can actually start to transform you to be this servant that
2:27:03
you are called to. To have this servant heart, you have to be devoted to be a
2:27:09
servant. Something about Elisha is we don't see Elisha going to Elijah constantly
2:27:15
asking, "So, um, am I going to rece am I going to get to receive your anointing? Am I going to get to receive your
2:27:20
mantle? Are you going to release me yet?"
2:27:26
He's just focused on serving. He's focused on serving. And that's how
2:27:31
it should be. When it's your time to be lifted, it's going to be God that lifts you.
2:27:38
You don't need to remind God. You don't need to remind people your leaders or
2:27:44
something. You don't need to remind Elijah of today.
2:27:49
It will be God himself who lifts you divinely.
2:27:55
If he if he wants to lift you, promote you, anoint you to now go into ministry
2:28:03
and you are planted like a place like here like fivefold church, you are planted. He will speak to your spiritual
2:28:09
leader who carries prophetic anointing for my case here whose spiritual father
2:28:16
is a prophet and will will prophesy to you.
2:28:21
It is time. You are called to be an apostle, a prophet, evangelist, a pastor, a
2:28:27
teacher, a worship leader, whatever. A leader in this way. I anoint you.
2:28:33
Go out now. It will be clear. It will be God's timing.
2:28:40
That is how it's supposed to be. God lifting you, not you rushing the lifting, not you
2:28:48
trying to lift yourself because of impatience. Slow down
2:28:54
and become a servant. That is your calling. Whether you're called to be a
2:29:00
leader in ministry or not, the calling is the same, to be a servant.
2:29:07
So focus fully on being a servant and God will unfold everything else.
2:29:17
He will lift you. He will reward you.
2:29:23
He will pour out blessings through the lifting as you continue to humble
2:29:29
yourself. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:29:36
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
2:29:41
Jesus. We're going to give to God right now. Um, glory to God. I know I'm so touched.
2:29:48
God is so touched by your pure, humble hearts for quickly
2:29:55
receiving God's ways, God's principles. Hallelujah.
2:30:01
Thank you, Jesus. I I want I want to speak over all of you who are going to give. First of all, if you want to give,
2:30:07
go, this is how give it. 5church.org/give QR code. I just want to say that the
2:30:14
only offering we desire here is from the heart.
2:30:20
This is from obedience to God. Amen. And I always want people to know that
2:30:27
that you can receive without giving. There's no transaction to receive miracles. Amen.
2:30:35
So only give when you feel cheerful to, but I
2:30:41
encourage you to respond to the obedience of God. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:30:51
As you as you give today, I want I want to declare over you, I seek God with
2:30:56
this seed bringing a big change in the heart.
2:31:05
The pure in heart shall see God. And every act of obedience, every act of
2:31:11
sacrifice, it it gives God permission to change you, to change your heart. Every
2:31:17
act of obedience. So this in this act of obedience to sew to God to sew to his
2:31:22
work his kingdom I see God bringing a great molding of your heart through
2:31:28
that. I want to encourage all of you here when
2:31:34
you sew to sew with a prayer request to sew with this prayer request of
2:31:42
asking God to rid you of the things in your heart that's been holding you back. selfish ambition, pride,
2:31:50
just a resistance to grab the new wine.
2:31:57
If these things you've been dealing with, ask God to remove these things
2:32:05
and renounce them. And I want to encourage you with this seed to because the seed is is is is is
2:32:13
making it very like concrete and secure with this prayer request. It's an
2:32:19
action of sacrifice, thanking God for it, and believing that he's answering this prayer, honoring him, giving him
2:32:27
thanksgiving through action. But
2:32:32
I want you to really look at your heart. like really look deeply in your heart right now and be honest with God.
2:32:40
And maybe you're seeing other people, they're it seems like they're easy to receive the new wine. They're easy to to
2:32:47
just quickly obey God and you feel like you've had resistance or you feel like
2:32:52
you you hear Pharisee voices in your head, religious voices in your head, and it's like you know they're not true, but
2:32:58
like it has an impact on you. I want you to be real with God and and
2:33:04
and tell him you desire to have a pure heart through and through, a servant
2:33:09
heart, a clean heart who will never miss him,
2:33:15
who will quickly be flexible, adapt to to how he's moving, who will receive a
2:33:20
new thing, who will receive the new wine, who will receive principles, his new wine principles.
2:33:28
Who will be a chosen one? Many are called, few are chosen. Many,
2:33:34
many like to hold on to at least some of the religiousness.
2:33:39
Tell God you want to be the few, one of the few that will be have a total
2:33:45
pure heart, a usable tool in God's hands. Just tell
2:33:50
him, can you close your eyes and talk to God right now? This is a life-changing moment right now. Oh, I see I see right
2:33:56
now there is a major transformation of the heart taking place among all of you
2:34:01
