43:49
over the world watching us right now with us here with us in the spirit. Welcome everybody watching online from
43:56
all around the world. Good morning, good evening. I know you're all in different time zones. Welcome. Write in the
44:01
comments where you're tuning in from. Remember to share this live stream with your family, with your friends, with everybody on your social media because
44:08
God is doing wonders through these live streams every single time. He's moving in tremendous shocking power every
44:15
single time. If you have received a miracle while watching line online,
44:20
write in the comments, that's me. And if that's you here, you can raise your hand. Hallelujah. Praise God. I know
44:28
you've re more of you have received miracles than that. Raise your hand if you've received watching online. God moved through the screen. It's a lot of
44:35
hands. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. So get ready. Get expectant
44:40
to receive. God is doing all kinds of miracles, bringing healing, bringing deliverance through the screen. So lift
44:47
your faith so you don't miss out on this tremendous blessing of God's power of miracles upon miracles that God's doing.
44:53
In case you didn't know, Jesus loves you so much that he doesn't want you to be in bondage by the devil here on this
45:00
earth. He wants you to have abundant life, heaven on earth, life here on this earth. He came to destroy the works of the devil and bring you healing and
45:07
freedom. We have needed revival. We have needed God's power. That's why we haven't seen many miracles by and large,
45:14
especially operating in the church. But this is God's will that he would heal and deliver all of his people. As we
45:20
accept his revival and accept his ways, we are receiving the blessing and grace. As the Bible says, if my people will
45:26
humble themselves and pray, I will heal heal their land. So, as we have humbled
45:31
ourselves and received and prayed and received God's revival, he is bringing healing and deliverance and so many
45:38
miracles that's shocking us because the humility was needed to get in alignment with his ways of how he moves in power
45:45
to bring miracles. Amen. So, I say all that to say, lift your faith like never before because Jesus really is this
45:52
good. And Jesus really does want to heal you and deliver you. It's not just talk.
45:57
This is real. This is true story. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
46:05
Well, I want to share uh an amazing praise report with all of you. Um we
46:12
have 46 small groups all over the nation and the world. We we've had about six
46:17
new ones added um just about this month. So, make sure you are signing up looking
46:23
to where they are near you. For example, Nebraska, even if you're not in Nebraska, surrounding states, you can
46:29
join. So, go to the link in my bio or 5church.org/smallgroups to join. It is remarkable what God's
46:35
doing in these small groups. It is so remarkable. But because God God commands us to gather together and worship him.
46:43
And so now that God has opened up this door for there to be these fivef small groups physically and virtually through
46:50
the zoom calls as he has opened up this door now he is asking you if you are in
46:56
the you know if you are near these areas or even if you're not the nearest one
47:02
near the the one closest to you he's asking you to join them. Those of you watching online, this is for people who
47:08
cannot come in person and gather together, but that you would gather together so that the revival fire would
47:14
grow in your nation, in your state, in your city. So, this is so powerful. God
47:19
is honoring. He's honoring your obedience to gather together and your
47:25
heart for revival to spread in your area. He honors that with bringing more
47:32
blessings upon your life. So I say that to say don't miss out on these small
47:37
groups. Do not miss out on them because there's something so powerful, something so supernatural that God is doing in
47:44
these small groups. I am I the small group leaders give me reports every single week. They give me detailed
47:51
reports testifying of what happened in the small group, what's what's going on,
47:56
the testimonies of people, and I'm reading them all and I'm left in awe and wonder. I post them on my stories. You
48:02
can see these testimonies in my stories, but I just want to share I'm I'm just in awe of how mightily God is moving every
48:09
single time and how he is pouring out just such a blessing and grace upon these small groups. So join them online
48:17
and in person if they're they're both online and in person depending on the small group. So I encourage you do not
48:23
miss out on this grace. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. It's
48:29
like a special grace like when you come here in person in LA, God is asking you to come here, you know, because so many
48:35
people are receiving miracles online. It's so true. And so sometimes maybe you live in LA, maybe you live a couple
48:41
hours away or something. Maybe you could think, "Oh, I don't need to go in person or I don't need to go every week. I
48:47
don't need to spend two hours driving. I could just watch online." Maybe you could think that. But gathering together
48:52
in person when this door is open, when God has opened up that door is so
48:58
important. This is obedience to God because as we come together in person, we become a brighter light for the
49:05
people in LA to find us. Amen. And as you come in person, there's just
49:11
a special grace that comes upon you that's not the same as if you watch online if you're able to get there. Now,
49:17
it's rare that the power of God is moving in churches today. It's rare that that that there's an
49:23
acceptance of the five-fold ministry, which is critical to be in God's order.
49:29
And so because of that, we're in a unique time right now where God is
49:34
absolutely calling people from around the world to be planted at Five-fold
49:40
Church, even though they're far away and they can't come in person every week or maybe
49:45
even only once a year or something if that. But because it's priority that
49:51
people are receiving God's power, receiving anointed teachings and equipping
49:56
and the the equipping that comes from the five-fold ministry. This is what God is asking of his people to be planted.
50:03
You must be planted at a church where God's power is that is truly anointed by God. Amen.
50:08
And so that's what's so important to God. And God can do he he can't be
50:14
limited. So he can do things that that you think he could only do in person, he can do through the screen. Amen.
50:20
But you got to understand that there's different graces. Like if you're able to get here in person, you won't receive
50:26
the grace of watching online that someone who can't come here in person cuz they're far away and God didn't open
50:32
up the door for them to have provision to fly every week. The grace that they would have. Does that make sense?
50:38
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, this is now I want to encourage all of you, those of you that are in LA, those of you that
50:43
are watching that are in LA or a couple hours away or an hour away or something, get here because you're missing out if
50:50
you're not here in person. It's not that you won't receive online
50:56
still, but there's so much more when you are obedient to come in person. Anybody
51:01
a testimony of that? If can you raise your hand if that's if you've experienced that? If you notice a difference, praise God. like most
51:08
people. Praise God. Hallelujah. And you don't have an excuse
51:13
because Jesus is priority. Jesus is worth the drive. A church alive is worth the drive and the flight.
51:21
We have We have two people that fly every single Sunday to be here and they
51:26
fly back. They fly in Saturday night or Sunday morning and fly back Sunday night. two people that have been doing this for
51:33
several months, many, many months, every single week. We have other people, many
51:40
of you here that drive. If you drive more than two hours, raise your hand
51:45
to be here every Sunday to be here every Sunday. If you drive more than an hour and a half, raise your
51:52
hand to be here every Sunday. That's a lot of hands.
51:58
If you drive three hours, raise your hand to be here. Wow. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
52:06
So, I encourage you. It's worth the sacrifice. Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Well, back to my praise report about the
52:13
small groups. Um, so we have small groups all over the world and one of our small groups is in the Philippines.
52:20
And as I mentioned last Sunday, the the small group leaders in the Philippines had this wonderful creative idea of how
Testimonies
52:27
to shine their light of how to reach people in their city and nation
52:33
so that they may encounter God's power and be part of revival. And so they had this idea to do a block screening to
52:39
rent a movie theater and play Revival is now Philippines from last year from
52:44
exactly a year ago where 8,000 people filled the arena in Manila. And God did so many miracles. And so this happened.
52:51
I believe it was yesterday. It was September 20th for them, which they're way ahead of us in the time. But uh I
52:59
have praise report to share what God did. I'm so in awe hearing the miracles
53:04
that Jesus did, how powerfully he moved. So I'm just going to read right now a little recap testimonies of what God
53:12
did. You ready? Um but actually before I read it, I think first I want to actually share a
53:17
video. So, as I read it, you can picture it. And in the video, I also want to share
53:23
another praise report that we've had a couple uh the the 5F Texas small group and the 5F Poland small group. They have
53:31
done baptisms because there was a hunger for baptisms for people in their state and nation. And so, um that was this
53:38
past week. And another one was like a couple weeks ago. So, you're going to see some of that in it in the video, too. So, let's watch it.
53:45
[Applause] [Music]
53:52
Where could I hide from your presence? Where could I go that your love wouldn't
53:58
meet me there? Oh my God, you're everywhere. Where will
54:03
I go from your spirit? Where could I hide? your presence.
54:10
I love I know that your love wouldn't be
54:16
[Music] [Applause]
54:27
[Music] where I go from your
54:36
I Everywhere
54:48
you're right. Oh my god, you're everywhere.
54:57
[Applause] [Music] We always
55:04
we honor you gathering
55:10
[Applause]
55:16
even there. Every mile reminded
55:24
even you're there. Hallelujah.
55:31
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you,
55:38
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. So, I'm going to be sharing
55:45
some testimonies now of the Philippines um screening
55:50
where they played the replay of Revival Now Philippines. So it said so they shared about 125 people came to the
55:57
revival now Philippines replay and 70% of those in attendance were not even part of the Philippines small group. So
56:04
these were people who um had heard about it when I shared last Sunday and also
56:10
people that um our 5F church small group had evangelized to had shared with them
56:17
about this screen and invited them and they came. Praise God. Some even traveled by plane, ship, or land just to
56:24
attend. We believe some traveled up to 18 hours for this event. Others came
56:31
because they heard the announcement made at church last Sunday. Other attendees didn't know about 5F Church yet. They
56:36
found out about the event through the flyers we handed out and the pro promotional videos, backdrops inside of
56:41
the mall. There were also mall workers we shared flyers with who came to the event. Some even changed their schedules
56:48
so they could attend the block screening. During the screening, during worship, so many people started
56:54
receiving a touch from Jesus. Some began to get delivered, shaking, weeping uncontrollably.
57:00
And there were even two people who were getting deliverance like coughing out demons. During the
57:07
ministry time, it truly became a mass deliverance inside the movie theater, just as you declared it last Sunday.
57:13
Everyone was so hungry to receive from God. Everywhere you looked, people were being touched powerfully, manifesting,
57:18
shaking, coughing out, de being delivered, and crying. Even the crews
57:24
that we hired for lights and sound were touched powerfully by God as you were declaring, "Glory to God.
57:31
Glory to God." So, there's this woman who her name is
57:37
Ann. She testified that as she was doing the lights and sound DJ, she was hired to do that during the event, during the
57:43
ministry time. At the end where Apostle was praying for people in the arena, her heart was deeply touched. She said that
57:49
while she was DJing, she closed her eyes and removed her headset to better hear Apostle and she started to cry so hard
57:55
as she was deeply moved. She really felt the power and says she felt the touch of Jesus healing and delivering her from
58:00
things she was going through. We even saw um security guards, light and sound
58:05
crews, cleaners standing still while watching as if their eyes were being opened to how powerful God is. When the
58:13
fire of the Holy Spirit was released, so many people suddenly began praying in tongues. It was truly powerful like
58:18
heaven on earth. It was amazing to witness people getting delivered, receiving the fire of the Holy Spirit, and so much more, even just through the
58:25
screen. After the service, those people brought those people bought lots of 5F merch and expressed their interest in
58:30
joining the 5F small group, even though it was just their very first time watching you minister. These are some
58:36
testimonies. Jinky, prior to the event, she felt so heavy and had shortness of breath. But after the event, she felt so
58:42
light and can breathe normally. The headache and burden in her heart also was lifted. Also, before the event, she
58:47
wrote in her journal, "Holy Spirit, remove everything that you didn't want in my life." Now, she declares, "I am healed. I am free." God used the online
58:54
teachings of her spiritual mom, Apostle Katherine, to seek Jesus more in her life. She cannot explain the joy she's experiencing now in surrender and fire
59:01
for Jesus. Glory to God. Angelica traveled from a distant province to attend re the revisit revivals now
59:08
Philippines event. During last night's event, as the worship started, she experienced so much joy in her heart to Jesus. Last year, when she attended
59:14
Revivals Now Philippines and the the actual event, she was skeptical and the devil implanted thoughts in her mind
59:20
that she didn't receive anything. But this time during the event uh she received the declarations and declared
59:25
herself that I am healed that I am free. She felt the presence of God while listening to the message and she couldn't explain what she was feeling
59:31
except that she was just so full of joy. Hallelujah. She was also so thankful to
59:36
be born in this area era to experience revival. Praise God.
59:43
Hallelujah. Donna Lynn testified that while watching
59:48
the replay of Revival is now a Philippines in the cinema when Apostle declared that someone who has a problem sleeping and when she wakes up she feels
59:55
that heaviness she received it and she was filled with so much joy and started to laugh. She also received when Apostle
1:00:00
declared healing from pain in her back because her work required her to weigh heavy sacks of rice. So even as she
1:00:05
traveled she could feel the pain on her back and after watching she felt her back was healed and she was filled with so much peace and joy and felt free from
1:00:11
the lies of the enemy. Praise God. We met Danny while we were in the mall
1:00:17
giving out flyers. He had our pictures we had our pictures taken in a photo booth where he worked. Afterwards, we
1:00:22
shared about the event and he was so excited about it. Almost every day when we would go to the mall to run errands, we would pass by his booth and he would
1:00:28
always have the biggest smile. So, we were so excited to see him at the event. During the event, he shared that every
1:00:33
word spoken during the teaching and deliverance during the the during the replay of Revival Now Philippines deeply
1:00:38
impacted him. It opened his eyes to God's power. He was in tears the whole time and in that moment he surrendered
1:00:43
everything to God. He also shared that this is exactly what he has been looking for and now he's looking forward to
1:00:49
being part of the small group. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
1:00:56
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you Jesus.
1:01:02
Thank you Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank you Lord for moving upon
1:01:08
these people in the Philippines. Thank you, Jesus, for expanding your revival. Hey, this was them watching a replay
1:01:15
that you can watch on YouTube. You know, all those miracles that happened, it was from them watching the
1:01:21
replay on the movie screen. Well, you don't have to see it on a movie screen. You can watch it on your iPhone, on any
1:01:27
phone you have, or the TV screen or your laptop or iPad.
1:01:33
Amen. So, if you want to watch that, I bet it was so powerful. You can see it
1:01:38
on YouTube. Type in Revival is now Philippines and my name and you'll find
1:01:44
it. Praise God. And you will receive powerfully like they did. Amen.
1:01:49
You got you just position yourself where God's power is and believe and miracles
1:01:54
will happen. Whether it's the live stream or in
1:02:00
person right now or a replay of today even or a past event. Amen. Hallelujah.
Testimonies
1:02:07
Speaking of small groups, we have two different small group leaders here today, which is so exciting. This is the
1:02:14
most ever on one Sunday. We have um Lindsay from Indiana.
1:02:21
And we have Stephanie. Where's Stephanie?
1:02:28
Stephanie from New Jersey. Hallelujah. Can Stephanie, can you and
1:02:33
Lindsay come? Come up. Hallelujah.
1:02:40
Praise God.
1:02:46
Yeah. Come on up. Hello. So, we have Indiana, small group
1:02:51
leader, New Jersey small group leader. I would love for you can come on over here, hun. You can come here and just
1:02:59
stand next to Lindsay. And um I would love for you to share briefly your just testimony in general and
1:03:07
of how your life has changed after stepping into this revival and also just
1:03:12
what God is doing in the small group in Indiana and beyond. Okay. Um, yes, my name is Lindsay and
1:03:20
um, so I'm celebrating my three years of being set free. That's why I'm here
1:03:25
today. I want to just glorify God. And I was one of those who got delivered
1:03:31
just from watching on my phone, my iPhone, and I was watching a revival now event. And um, Jesus delivered me from
1:03:41
decades of tormenting spirits. The worst one was jealousy. I was a very jealous
1:03:48
person and very insecure and um
1:03:53
especially jealous of women. So, it's only like God to give me now a pastor
1:03:59
who is a woman. And um but actually when I first came across
1:04:06
your videos, I I was so tormented and didn't know it, but I needed deliverance
1:04:12
and I came across your videos and my first reaction was that I needed to block you. And so I tried blocking
1:04:19
Apostle and all the other sources that her videos were coming in through. And
1:04:25
then wouldn't you know it, her videos kept coming up. It's the grace of God.
1:04:32
And there was just this still small voice inside of me that said, "Maybe there's a reason that her videos are
1:04:37
still coming up." So I started to then watch over time. It was like, "Okay, I'm
1:04:43
just going to try this out and watch what she's doing." And I fell in love
1:04:48
with you and what you were doing. And I was like, "This is alive. this is Jesus.
1:04:54
And I was just so taken by this ministry. I was hooked. And so then I
1:04:59
was binge watching her. So I went from blocking her to binge watching. And I look back, I'm like, how did that even
1:05:06
happen? I'm like, I have young children. I was like, how did God give me the grace to binge watch anything, you know?
1:05:12
But he did. And um eventually after a few months of just watching and
1:05:18
receiving, I was watching Revival Now event and God orchestrated it beautifully. I was home
1:05:24
by myself so I could really focus in on it and I was just sitting there on my it
1:05:29
was late at night sitting on my couch in my bathrobe just ready to watch, not expecting anything. And God just like
1:05:37
came into our house. He slayed every giant in my life.
1:05:45
He set me free from literally decades of tormenting thoughts. Jealousy, like I
1:05:50
said, was the biggest thing. Pride, angel of light, religion, the list goes
1:05:56
on and on. And the next morning I, you know, after the revival event was over,
1:06:01
the next morning I woke up. I was a brand new woman. Like, I'm not kidding.
1:06:07
I was a brand new woman. And there was like this supernatural peace and energy and joy that was just
1:06:13
like radiating out of me, flowing out of me. Apostle, my family is so different.
1:06:19
What you are doing is healing families. It's healing children and moms and dads
1:06:26
and marriages. And I'm just so grateful to God. Like our my marriage is so much
1:06:31
better. And my kids are experiencing the Lord through me. I'm not perfect. All right? like I three years and I'm still
1:06:39
growing but like it's so much healthier, so much safer and just joyfilled in our
1:06:46
home. Glory to God. So I that's this is my daughter Abigail here. And the first
1:06:53
thing that she said the day after that this took place, the first thing that she said was, "Mom, you are smiling."
1:07:02
and she didn't know what had happened, but they were so used to seeing a mother who was downcast and and sad and
1:07:10
depressed. And now like I smile so much that people think I'm weird and I love it. G it's Jesus, you know, like I my
1:07:18
cheeks hurt. I smile so much. It's the joy of the Lord. Like he removed that
1:07:24
that heaviness. He gave me a garment of praise. I'm so grateful to God. This
1:07:29
ministry is the real deal. This is Jesus.
1:07:38
And as far as the small group goes, so yes, we are small, but um God has done
1:07:44
some big things in our small group. Like someone in our group was set free from homosexuality. Another married couple,
1:07:53
there is infidelity and now they're both planted here at 5F and their marriage is restored. Um we have seen um
1:08:01
fibromyalgia healed. I don't Tina's here. She's here. She was healed of fibromyalgia and like 23 years of like
1:08:08
horrible back pain. De debilitating back pain. Um
1:08:13
I mean like yeah, like I said, we're small, but God's doing big things. And I I tell my group all the time, you guys
1:08:19
really inspire me. Like I'm so honored to be their small group leader. When I first got the message that I was going
1:08:25
to be a small group leader, I thought you got hacked. And so I was like, "Oh no." Like I had
1:08:33
to reread that message multiple times cuz I'm like, "There's no way they would
1:08:38
ask me to do that." And so I thought you were hacked. But I eventually like I Yeah, I believed the message and I was
1:08:45
like, "Yes, I'll do it." And and yeah, so anyway, but um yes, so the small
1:08:53
group has been so fun. They inspire me. They are serious. Their hearts are passionate and they're watching right
1:08:58
now. And so I just want to say hi to my small group. I love them so much. These are powerful groups to join. So if
1:09:05
you're a hooer, if you're in Indiana, please come join us. What God's doing is so powerful. We also represent Kentucky,
1:09:13
Michigan, and Ohio as well. We have members from there also. So amen.
1:09:20
Hallelujah. Wow. Hallelujah.
1:09:26
Jesus. Wow. Hallelujah.
1:09:32
Can you come here? What I see over you, I see something
1:09:38
rare. I see something so rare. Um man, when when you will surrender everything
1:09:45
to Jesus, he will bring a transformation that is just so shocking and that
1:09:51
glorifies him so much. And Apostle Paul is such such an a shocking amazing
1:09:58
testimony that God can really do what seems impossible. And so he had this
1:10:04
just horrible murderous spirit before he became Paul. before he became
1:10:11
Paul, when he was Saul, I mean, he how how could no one could fathom that God
1:10:17
would be able to use him, let alone him be Apostle Paul with such purity of heart, the drastic
1:10:24
change of heart. And that's rare. In fact, that's the only example we have of
1:10:29
that in in the New Testament. You because the rest of the disciples, they started out not being like evil, doing
1:10:37
evil things. I mean, they needed Jesus. they were sinners, but they they had this open, pure heart, ready to quickly
1:10:43
follow Jesus, you know. So, it's rare. And so, anyways, I see this this rare
1:10:49
unique testimony, modern-day Bible testimony of like Saul to Paul and you because I'm
1:10:56
telling you, it's rare for someone to be jealous and prideful and then truly
1:11:04
become pure and humble. And so I just want to say that God is so proud of you
1:11:12
for surrendering to him so he could do this great change. And I see your
1:11:17
testimony is going to touch many many lives. And God's going to use you mightily.
1:11:24
God's going to use you mightily. And that that feeling of like me getting ha
1:11:30
you me getting hacked. You thought maybe it shows just the purity of your heart and that God that God can really use you
1:11:37
because you don't see you see yourself rightly. You don't see yourself highly. You've
1:11:45
humbled yourself. And so God has such great plans to use you in this
1:11:50
anointing, in this revival. He's proud of you. He's so proud of you. I speak
1:11:56
this anointing to come upon you now in new levels. May this revival fire burn
1:12:02
more in you. And may God use you to spread this revival in Indiana, the
1:12:09
Midwest, and beyond in Jesus' name. May this small group grow. May it grow. May
1:12:15
it grow in Jesus' name to be a huge massive group in Jesus' name. Amen.
1:12:23
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Tina, where's Tina?
1:12:32
Where's Tina? Come here, hun. Come here.
1:12:38
[Laughter] Hallelujah. Welcome home.
1:12:48
Hallelujah. Praise God. Come here, hun. Is this is this your first time at 5F
1:12:55
Church? And I'm like, "Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. I've seen her online."
1:13:02
You know, you are one of the first people I saw actually to to to give honor to my spiritual father and I'll
1:13:09
never forget that. And I you always stuck with me just the the purity of heart that you had. And God is so proud
1:13:16
of you. and I'm so blessed to see you in person right now home. Would you like to
1:13:23
share a testimony of what God's done? Yes. Um
1:13:28
I was really sick for like three years with fibromyalgia, arthritis,
1:13:34
mental torment, thoughts of dying because I wanted the pain to all go away.
1:13:44
I never thought I would be standing here like this, ever healed. I lived in bed.
1:13:50
I lived in bed for three years.
1:13:56
And all I did was find you online.
1:14:03
And I said, "Lord, is this real?" And he said, "Yes, Tina.
1:14:09
This is real. and this is where I want you to stay. So, I obeyed.
1:14:17
And that was at the end of 2021, like maybe New Year's Eve or something like that. And so
1:14:25
now, of course, I'm healed of everything. There was there was
1:14:32
there was no moment where I could say something happened and I was healed. It just
1:14:38
happened to me. Um, one day I just didn't have pain anymore,
1:14:44
you know. One day everything like I just noticed slowly. But when I went one time
1:14:50
to Peoria, Illinois, I had over 20 years of herniated disc pain in my L4 and L5
1:14:58
and it was very tremendous pain. I had to revival. Yeah. And we me and my husband
1:15:04
she went to the you and your husband went to the revival is now Peoria, Illinois. And that was in 2023
1:15:10
and um the next day I was walking down my hallway and Holy
1:15:16
Spirit said, "Tina, I took away your herniated disc pain and I took away
1:15:22
chronic fatigue." And so I never have had pain again since
1:15:28
2023 in that area. And the last thing, there's a lot of
1:15:34
things I was healed of, but the last thing I would like to share is on my birthday, I woke up April 26th,
1:15:41
2023 before Peoria and my husband stepped out of the room and said, "There's something wrong with
1:15:47
me, honey." And I said, "Well, what's wrong?" He said, "I don't know, but there's something wrong." So I said,
1:15:54
"Well, come lay down." And so I said, "Remember when I laid hands on your knee
1:15:59
and it was really swollen and God took the pain away?" And he said, "Yes." And then I would remind him of other things
1:16:05
that God did through me because of your anointing imparted to me. And he said, "Yes." I said, "I'm going to pray over
1:16:11
you." And he said, "Okay." So, I started with his feet and I worked my hands all
1:16:16
the way up his body and I don't know what I cast out. I just the Holy Spirit
1:16:22
just kept giving me things and I I was like, I you know, reject this that and
1:16:27
he come out, you know, whatever it is. because I just the Holy Spirit gave me the words and next thing I know I was
1:16:33
putting my hands up on his belly and I felt like you know movement in there and then I put him up on his chest and it
1:16:39
felt really like like a snake or something. I don't know how to explain it but it felt like something in there and I said honey can you feel that and
1:16:44
he said yes. I said this thing's coming out in Jesus name.
1:16:50
And so I I I went all the way up and I to his head and I said get up and out of him now. And he said I need a bucket. He
1:16:59
didn't watch Revival is now. He didn't watch this stuff at that time too much. So, he had no idea about people coughing
1:17:06
up. And he said, "I need a bucket." And I'm like, "I'll go get it." And I ran. And I got it. And And he started
1:17:13
coughing and coughing until he spit something out into the bucket. After that, our broken marriage was completely
1:17:21
restored. He had freedom. I had freedom. And it's amazing
1:17:28
what the enemy does in your marriage. You think it's just you're mad this and that, but it's the enemy. It's demons.
1:17:34
It's they're speaking to you and you're believing it about your spouse. Yeah. So, everything after that has changed.
1:17:41
So, thank you so much. Thank you so much. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:17:48
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come here, Hun. Come here.
1:17:55
God is so proud of you. I just see his delight over you. You have a rare heart,
1:18:00
a pure heart. The pure in heart shall see God. And I see that even your spiritual eyes opened up just earlier
1:18:08
on, earlier than than many others because of your pure heart. And God is so proud of you. You are a great example
1:18:15
for many. And I see God blessing you, rewarding you for your obedience to him.
1:18:23
And I see God using you in greater and greater ways to spread his revival, to
1:18:28
lead people to him. I speak this anointing to increase in your life now.
1:18:34
Receive new levels of his anointing. Receive new levels of peace, of joy, of
1:18:40
abundant life in every area. Let revival spread through you in great great ways
1:18:47
in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:18:55
Hallelujah Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
1:19:02
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Stephanie.
1:19:10
Hallelujah. New Jersey small group leader.
1:19:15
Welcome home. Praise God. Praise God. Can you share what God has been doing
1:19:21
and your testimony briefly? Amen. Okay. Okay. Um, so in 2020, part of my
1:19:30
testimony is that in 2020, the doctors diagnosed me with breast cancer and I
1:19:35
was very sick. I was very in bondage. I had fear, anxiety,
1:19:42
and um I remember I I was seeking healing and I saw one of your videos in
1:19:48
in social media and um when I when I saw it, I I I saw you were going to have a
1:19:54
Zoom meeting and I joined the meeting and I remember when I when I joined, I I
1:20:00
fell asleep on the preaching to be honest. But then when you were about to
1:20:05
pray for the people, when I was sleeping, I felt somebody waking me up and and then I woke up and then I saw
1:20:12
you were like calling people and I entered the Zoom and and then you called
1:20:17
people and I saw there was like 500 people and I said there is no way she's going to call me. It's too many people.
1:20:24
And then said I'm just going to receive here. And then um you did the mass prayer and and I remember in the last
1:20:31
last part you call my name and and and then you pray for me and um I receive
1:20:37
powerfully um I remember I I because of the treatments I um they put me the
1:20:44
doctors on so many medications it caused you know things in my body. I was actually coughing green fleg which is
1:20:51
called um uh variant asthma every day. Every day I was coughing and when you
1:20:57
prayed over me that next day I actually stopped the medication and I was healed.
1:21:02
The green fle stopped and glory to God and and I was full of joy that night. I
1:21:10
was I slept like like a baby and then ever since then um then I remembered
1:21:15
like two months later you did another sum and I joined and I was having I was battling with the fear of cancer coming
1:21:22
back and I didn't and the doctors wanted me to put on more medication to prevent it. So when you call me on the second
1:21:29
zoom, I remember I told you about this and then I said I just need faith to
1:21:34
believe that cancer is not going to come back and stop all the medication and then you pray for me for that
1:21:41
supernatural faith and I stop every medication to prevent the cancer and ever since then I'm cancer free up to
1:21:49
today no cancer. Praise God.
1:21:54
And every time that every time the enemy tried to bring fear, I remember that day
1:21:59
that and I remember the words and I said, "No, I only need the blood of Jesus. Gangster never will come back."
1:22:06
And ever since then, I am free of fear and anxiety and depression. And then I I
1:22:13
start watching your teachings and I start learning. And what impressed me I or what I fell in love with it was your
1:22:19
the pure heart that you carry and the purity and how to be a servant. All
1:22:25
these things I learned and and and that I I treasure the most and my heart is
1:22:31
full of gratitude because my life has been transformed. You have no idea. My kids I teach everything like in that
1:22:38
year in 2023 I I was teaching my kids everything I learned from you. They're
1:22:43
seven and 11 and every time I teach them like your words have power this this and
1:22:50
then lately my my sevenyear-old when I say something he will remind me mommy your words have power don't say this so
1:22:58
I thank you so much because my kids are learning and receiving from this anointing too and my life has been
1:23:05
completely transformed and I praise God and there's a lot of things that God did but healed me that more sickness that I
1:23:12
had In that year after the cancer I had u something in my hair several dermatitis I was in medication God
1:23:19
healed me from that a lot of things um also for my heart I was on medication and I stop everything and I'm healed and
1:23:26
glory to God thank you thank you and u the groups the small New Jersey
1:23:33
small group I actually um saw that um the North Carolina group brought some
1:23:39
members and I announced it in the group if somebody wants to come because I had in my heart to come and I said I don't
1:23:45
want to come alone. I want to bring some of them and they're here sitting with me. Three of them from New Jersey.
1:23:56
God is doing a lot in New Jersey. Uh there is a hunger for revival. I even um
1:24:02
a pastor joined the New Jersey group and he and he was hungering for revival and
1:24:08
he he asked me to bring you know his name um because he he for years for
1:24:13
years he was hungering and and you know the New Jersey and the east coast I
1:24:19
always felt alone because nothing was happening there like California Los Angeles revival was here and everything
1:24:25
was happening here and then now the hunger that it the revival is coming is
1:24:31
happening and I see the hunger in their hearts and and for revival to spread. We
1:24:37
pray every time and I and I love them so much and I see the how they're growing
1:24:42
with the teachings. They tell me they testify every every Thursday.
1:24:49
I'm sorry. and they say how they're growing, how they're like the the the
1:24:54
the revelation of of the teachings, like you know, everything that they're grasping from the teachings. It's just
1:25:01
amazing what God is doing in the group. Amen. Praise God. And I also like
1:25:07
Lindsay said uh when she received the message to be the leader, what happened to me was when I received the message, I
1:25:14
cried and the fear of the Lord came on me that day. I was sitting in my chair
1:25:19
and I start crying and I said, "God, I want to do it right. I don't want to make a mistake. Please, I couldn't
1:25:25
believe it in either that you also send the email like Linda shared."
1:25:33
Praise God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:25:39
Hallelujah. Wow. Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come here, hun.
1:25:47
I see such a pure fire in you. A pure fire. There's always been this passion
1:25:52
for God in you. This fire. And God has refined this fire. He has brought purity. I see power and purity in you.
1:26:00
And God is going to use you so powerfully in the East Coast to set it on fire.
1:26:07
He's put that desire in your heart for a reason. He's put that boldness, that passion,
1:26:14
that fire in you because that area needs to be lit up. They need to hear the good
1:26:19
news and encounter Jesus in power. Thank you, Jesus. I release this anointing to

1:27:34
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Arlo. Arlo and family. Come here.
1:27:42
[Applause]
1:27:50
You can come right over here. Hello. Welcome back home.
1:27:57
Thank you. Hallelujah. Wow. So, I was so blessed, first of all,
1:28:06
to hear your testimony. Some of you might have seen their testimony we shared on social media like a couple weeks ago or something. It was I was so
1:28:14
blessed. Could you share before coming
1:28:21
and what God did when you were here? It was what a few months ago, a couple months ago, two months ago, July.
1:28:29
Um my name is Arlo. Um,
1:28:35
two months ago we were here. Uh, before that my wife will follow you on YouTube
1:28:41
for months and months and and she wanted to go here and I was like, I don't want
1:28:46
to be there. There's no way. Um, because I grew up in a church and I have so much
1:28:53
old wine in me and and I was like, if you want the anointing, work for it.
1:28:59
Pray, you know. and and uh she wanted to come and when
1:29:05
and receive. And when I was here um
1:29:10
to be honest, I I didn't know
1:29:16
that God was going to touch me. I I didn't think that I deserve to be
1:29:21
forgiven. But I met the real Jesus who
1:29:28
can forgive you and wipe your sins away.
1:29:34
The Jesus that will accept you and and call you. You're my son. When you pray
1:29:39
for me, you you say, "Receive the anointing. Receive the fire of the Holy Spirit." And and and I believe that.
1:29:47
I didn't know how it was going to work, but I believe that. So we went back and
1:29:53
and the day started going by and by and um my life started to change. Chains
1:30:00
were broken. Um chains of uh lust uh change of u addiction and and and
1:30:07
religion condemnation and and I was in the same I was crying crying and crying.
1:30:13
I will listen to a song and just cry and I was like what is happening to me?
1:30:20
And I didn't want to pray for anybody. And then after um two weeks, I told my
1:30:27
wife, I want to pray for people. I didn't know what I was going to say, but
1:30:32
I I I wanted for them to to feel what I was feeling, the presence of God. And
1:30:38
and I started praying for people. And then God God started healing them.
1:30:44
And then how I was crying two months ago, they were started to cry too. And
1:30:49
I'm like I I started to to see that the the the Jesus from the Bible
1:30:57
was was real. And and um four days after
1:31:02
we left Sunday, it was a Thursday. Um we were on the on the on the I 10 and we
1:31:09
saw a billboard, huge billboard like 40 feet by 20 feet. And I saw that and I
1:31:14
saw a big big phone number and and I failed to call them and I'm like no no
1:31:20
no. But three seconds later I'm like okay I'm going to call them. So I called
1:31:25
them and then uh we rented that billboard. When I saw that, I felt it has to say fivefold church and Jesus
1:31:32
saves, delivers, and restores you and it's going to be um for we rented for
1:31:38
one year. And I know that that more people need to know need to come and and
1:31:44
find the real Jesus, not not religion. So,
1:31:54
we um the first time it was my wife saying,
1:31:59
"Let's go." And now we got a week off and I'm like, I was the one. Let's go.
1:32:05
We want more. We want more. And then and then um I used to be like,
1:32:11
"Oh, don't don't say this. What are they going to think of you if if they know
1:32:17
that you have a sin in your life? Oh no, keep the religious reputation in your life. Don't tell anybody. When I started
1:32:25
seeing the videos that they were like, "God, um, free me from this, free me from that, you know, from that scene and
1:32:31
that scene." I'm like, "Okay, I got to make my own video." Um
1:32:38
so I s I was uh recording myself for like an hour and then I was saying
1:32:43
sharing what I'm sharing you know that I I came over here and God was breaking chains that I had for many many many
1:32:49
years and then how God set me free and I was crying in that video and then I
1:32:54
posted that on Facebook and other people were watching that video and they told me I saw your video I saw the crying too
1:33:01
and and um so and I I I made this uh this shirt.
1:33:07
Jesus set me free from fill in the blank and and because I I I wanted to share
1:33:14
that if if if they're not ashamed if if you guys are not ashamed of of that then
1:33:19
I can say that too. I'm not ashamed of saying all the chains that you just broke. I'm not ashamed. So
1:33:29
that was on July. I I went back I went back and um um back to my classroom and
1:33:37
then even though I've been a teacher um I I've been working for the schools for 15 years when I saw my students I was
1:33:43
like ah the students again another school year a but then when I saw my
1:33:48
students the first day I felt I felt different I felt compassion for them and
1:33:55
and I was like guys uh every every hour the on on the first day I want to pray
1:34:00
over your life. Make your dreams come true. And and and I'm so in love with
1:34:05
the the prayer of the week. So I was like, I want to try that with my students. May God bless your life. May
1:34:11
God use you, you know, and then um
1:34:19
and and um so it's it's been it's been
1:34:25
um different in I'm I'm at work in the classroom and sometimes I you know listening to music and I'm crying so I
1:34:31
got to turn away you know turn around because I don't want my students to see me cry. I go home and I cry and I'm
1:34:37
telling my wife what's happening to me. I on that day I was there. I was born
1:34:43
again. And then
1:34:48
e even though for so many years I was you know Christian in a church to be honest
1:34:56
I knew that if if I died I would go to hell. I knew that. But after that day I
1:35:02
knew that if if I die I'm going to go to eternity with Jesus.
1:35:08
And um uh the pastor at our church invited me to share and I was sharing with the church. Guys, you know me for
1:35:15
many years, but I'm going to take off my mask. God freed me from that and that
1:35:20
and that chain, you know, so many things and and and I'm not the same. So I started sharing with that um and then I
1:35:28
invited him to come over, come over if you guys want me to pray for you. I didn't know what I was going to say. So
1:35:35
um I closed my eyes and then I opened my eyes and everybody was there like oh
1:35:41
like what am I going to do now? So I started praying one one one by one and
1:35:47
then the the amazing thing that Jesus was doing is that I was I was so shocked so surprised that they were crying
1:35:53
because of the the presence of God and it's like oh wow like what is happening
1:35:58
and and when when when we came here my wife was saying
1:36:04
we want to come here to take and receive take the anointing back and I was like
1:36:09
huh what is that like how does it work, you know, and and and when she pray and
1:36:15
when she say that receive the anointing, I didn't know, but I believe that and and we took back that to to New Mexico.
1:36:23
So, we are so blessed. Hallelujah.
1:36:29
Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:36:34
And let's shift this way. Huh? Let's shift this way.
1:36:40
Can you share briefly well first of all what your testimony in general like what
1:36:46
you received online but also can you share what it's been like watching this
1:36:52
transformation. Okay. Well, the um the reason I found
1:36:57
you uh is because she asked me something about the book of Revelations, about the seven spirits, and you came up and ever
1:37:04
since I've been watching you. It's been like a year and it's like what you spoke is what I've always wanted for our
1:37:12
church. So, I would tell my husband, "Look, babe, look." And he would like reject it and reject it and I would be
1:37:19
like, I finally got convinced that I didn't have to come here. And I'm like,
1:37:25
"Okay, I guess you're right." You know, but deep down inside, I knew I had to come. And then finally, well, God did
1:37:32
what he needed to do to be here. And um yeah, like after here, like at home, I
1:37:40
was surprised. I would be like, "Babe, are you okay?" Cuz I would catch him crying and he like, "Are you sick?
1:37:46
What's wrong? What's going on?" I thought something was wrong. It's just the presence of God. I'm like, "Oh,
1:37:52
okay." like, "Thank you, Jesus." You know? Yes. Um, and it's like really amazing
1:37:59
because I would question myself, well, he knows about the Bible. I know he grew up at church and that's why I married
1:38:06
him cuz he was Christian, you know. Um, because I always prayed for a Christian
1:38:11
man, but a lot of times where we could be Christians, but we have a lot in us
1:38:18
that we need to let go. we need to let God remove and that happened here. And
1:38:25
now um because we received um our desires for our whole church to receive
1:38:31
because now we see that you know we see that in our family. I brought my twin sister, my mom. We brought my
1:38:38
mother-in-law. We brought um a lot of family. There's 15 of us here and
1:38:44
there's 15 they have brought. Can you raise your hands?
1:38:50
15. Wow. Wow. So, um I told him, "You guys have to
1:38:58
come." And you know, there's always something that wants to stop you, but we're here and we plan to bring more. A
1:39:04
lot more wanted to come. They didn't come today, but they're going to come one day. Yes. Yes.
1:39:12
Hallelujah. Wow. If if you two can stand beside each
1:39:17
other, you want to receive more, God is going
1:39:23
to pour out more upon you. And I see God moving in such a fast way through you because, you know, I shared this, I
1:39:30
think it was last week, I believe, the the more pure you are, the quicker you will grow. And I really see there's a
1:39:38
theme today God's doing of from Saul's to Paul's. So I see like Paul
1:39:43
transformed so fast once his eyes opened up, once he really met Jesus. And so I
1:39:49
see this just quickening where because you are you're you're willing, you're
1:39:54
yes, we'll get a billboard for a year. God can use you in these mighty ways to reach so many people. And he has plans
1:40:03
that will amaze you, that will shock you of how he will use your lives to bring so many into the kingdom. I speak more
1:40:10
of this fire, more of this anointing to come upon you both. May this revival
1:40:16
spread so mightily in New Mexico through you, in the school, in the people in the
1:40:22
church. Everyone who sees the billboard and more in Jesus' name. Let this fire
1:40:28
increase. And I bless you. I bless your lives. I bless all of the work that you've done, the work of the billboard.
1:40:35
I bless it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:40:43
Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Wow. Jesus.
1:40:51
Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. These are s be creative.
1:40:57
Like the the movie theater screening, the billboard. Be creative to shine your
1:41:04
light like this. The harvest is ripe. The fields are ready. But you have to
1:41:11
use your mind. God's going to give you these ideas, creative ideas of how to shine your light in a special way, in a
1:41:17
unique way to reach people around your life. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:41:24
And if you ever have ideas like this, like for example, like the billboard, the the movie theater, email us. Email
1:41:31
us since it's like a big deal thing so that everything's in order and everything. Hallelujah. Praise God. This
1:41:37
is so incredible. Wow. Look at what Jesus can do in one second. In one
1:41:43
second. I'm amazed to see anybody amazed to see that transformation. Wow. Jesus.
1:41:52
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All right. Well, um, right now I'm going to share a
1:41:57
little video. Um, this past week it was the 9year
1:42:04
anniversary of when I first saw my spiritual father, prophet Jordi minister
1:42:09
and then soon after received the prophecy over my life that I was called to be an apostle and I was called to
1:42:14
reach the nations. And so that's where this all began. This we are here today
1:42:20
because of that prophetic word that was released in September of 2016. I can't
1:42:27
believe it's already been nine years and I'm in awe of God's faithfulness of how he brought that word to come to pass
1:42:33
beyond my imagination by what I could imagined or prayed for or dreamed. So,
1:42:38
we're going to celebrate and watch this video to see to celebrate what God has done. Amen.
1:42:49
[Music] anointing
1:42:58
fall on me.
1:43:03
Let the power of the Holy Ghost
1:43:09
fall on me. Let the power of the Holy Ghost
1:43:19
fall on me. Let the power to live a life that's
1:43:25
pleasing to you. Fall on me.
1:43:31
Let the power to treat everybody right in this life
1:43:38
on me. Let the anointing of the Holy Ghost
1:43:45
fall on me. anointing
1:43:52
fall. Did you ever think you would be an author?
1:43:58
No, not until the calling was revealed that I was called to be an apostle. Then I knew that God would want the word of
1:44:04
God, the messages he's given me to be in books. Hey, wo wo. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so happy I'm
1:44:13
alive today. I'm so happy I can see the light today. It don't matter if it's
1:44:19
rain or shine cuz I know God is on my side.
1:44:24
I'm so happy. Angels all around me. Hear them saying like
1:44:31
I'll never get used to this. I'll never get used to this.
1:44:37
This is how I want to live forever. We'll be singing.
1:44:44
Walk up the grave. I'm alive now. Told the devil boy you out of time now.
1:44:50
Spirit moving in me on my now. And I know it won't die out.
1:44:57
And now I see your blessings. See your blessings every day.
1:45:02
Let your kingdoms run away. Angels all around me. Hear them saying like
1:45:10
I never get used to this. I'll never get used to this.
1:45:16
This is how I want to live forever. We'll be singing
1:45:24
this. Many are called, but few are chosen. You
1:45:30
are chosen. You are specifically called for this.
1:45:37
[Music]
1:45:44
Glory to God. Glory to God.
1:45:57
[Applause] All glory to Jesus. Look what Jesus has
1:46:03
done. Look what Jesus has done. God, we thank you for what you have done in these nine years. God, you have
1:46:09
surpassed our dreams, our expectations. We stand in awe and wonder of you, Jesus. And we give you all the glory. We
1:46:16
thank you for your faithfulness. We thank you for this revival coming to pass. This word that you've spoken come
1:46:23
to pass. And for the victory that you have brought year after year, increasing
1:46:28
your revival, defeating every Pharisee giant that gets in the way and expanding
1:46:35
your revival to reach more and more people around the world. We thank you, Jesus, and we give you all the glory.
1:46:42
Amen. Amen. Praise God. Praise God.
1:46:48
Wow. Jesus. I'm sharing a message today uh called A Faith. Glory to God. A
Message
1:46:56
faith. A faith that refuses to quit. A faith that refuses to quit. And that's
1:47:05
by the grace of God been my story. God has graciously given me a faith that
1:47:14
refuses to quit. Hallelujah. Um, as you can see through
1:47:19
the pictures, I know a lot of you know my story. Maybe some of you don't though. As you can see from these pictures, from these videos,
1:47:26
there was a process. There was a journey to get to where we are now. To get to
1:47:33
where we are now, where we have people planted from 165 nations around the
1:47:39
world at 5F Church. to get to the place now where God has brought revival events
1:47:47
to 19 nations now where he has healed and delivered and saved and set on fire
1:47:54
thousands of people around the world. Glory to God.
1:47:59
Where God is moving in power and doing so many shocking miracles through the screen here in person like all of these
1:48:06
amazing testimonies we've heard today. It's been a journey to get to the place
1:48:12
where we have 46 small groups and small group leaders with precious hearts, as you can see,
1:48:20
that have been equipped, that have grown and are ready to be leaders and spread
1:48:25
this revival where they are at. It's been a journey to get to the place
1:48:30
where we have a theater in downtown LA that's full. Glory to God.
1:48:38
It's been a journey for me to feel comfortable in my own skin as an apostle
1:48:45
to be who God has called me to be. It's been a journey. It was a journey of
1:48:51
years. It was a journey of years where it looked like the opposite of all of this.
1:48:57
to look like the opposite of growth, the opposite of uh of of of of miracles
1:49:03
happening everywhere and testimonies everywhere, the opposite of feeling blessed in my
1:49:10
calling and comfortable.
1:49:16
We were decreasing in numbers at the church for years. God called me to start
1:49:21
the church nine months after receiving the prophecy. It started as worship nights on a mountaintop and we decreased
1:49:27
from 20 in the first year to 15 the next year to 10 the next year to five the next year. Then co hit the cherry on the
1:49:34
top and we couldn't have services inside anymore. So we had to go outside and
1:49:39
sometimes there was just two of us, John Tallal and I at times.
1:49:45
There was a time one time I was ministering after four years of going of feeling like going backwards the church
1:49:51
decreasing where there 100 degree weather you know being obedient to God despite the weather. We had to be have
1:49:58
church outside. It was September 100 something degrees. One person shows up and they leave in the middle of the
1:50:03
message. There was a lot of trying times,
1:50:10
trials upon trials to get here. It didn't happen overnight. There was a
1:50:17
process. There was a journey. And there was a choice to be made to not
1:50:24
give up, but to instead persevere and endure because believing God and obeying God is
1:50:33
the most important thing in this world. And so there had to be that choice. I
1:50:38
had to make that choice to keep going day after day, week after week, year after year.
1:50:44
On top of the church not growing but getting smaller and smaller every year. It was prophesied upon me over me that
1:50:51
God was going to do use me mightily do shocking miracles through me. And on top
1:50:56
of the church decreasing year after year I saw God move in the anointing. People would be baptized the Holy Spirit.
1:51:02
People would be touched by prophetic words. But there was hardly hardly any testimonies of miracles of healings of
1:51:08
fre of deliverances. But God spoke to me. God is going to the pro the prophetic word that was spoken
1:51:14
to me by my spiritual father. God is going to do many shocking miracles through you. And years later only
1:51:21
hearing like two testimonies of a healing of any kind taking place
1:51:29
after m ministering multiple times a week for four years.
1:51:35
My spiritual father prophesied revival is now for America. It's going to start
1:51:40
in LA. It's going to spread across the whole nation. It's going to spread across the whole world.
1:51:45
He prophesied that a year after I received my the prophecy I was called to be an apostle in 2017.
1:51:52
And so I'm expecting to see revival break out like he spoke like he prophesied. And it looks like the
1:51:59
opposite. On top of that, preaching, public speaking was my biggest fear and
1:52:05
weakness. And I had no idea how to preach.
1:52:11
I didn't feel like I got I would see other people have this revelation. I go to Bible studies and people would have this revelation. I wouldn't have
1:52:18
anything to say really. I was in awe of how ministers, pastors
1:52:24
had this revelation and on top of that they had fire to preach like, "Oh, you
1:52:29
guys need to hear this word of God." I was in awe of that. That did not happen to me naturally. I naturally didn't feel
1:52:37
like I was receiving this revelation of the word of God. And I naturally did not have a fire to preach.
1:52:43
I had a fire for people to encounter Jesus, but not through me. For me to
1:52:49
lead them to where I found people are being touched by God, like at churches where people are being touched by God,
1:52:54
which was few. And so I'm preaching out of obedience
1:53:01
for years. And for it wasn't until revival broke out in 2021 that I finally
1:53:08
found comfortable in my own skin to be an apostle.
1:53:14
It is finally where I didn't feel insecure as I preached.
1:53:21
Four years of a being uncomfortable, of it feeling like I'm going backwards.
1:53:30
Four years of feeling disappointment not in God but in the expectations I had set
1:53:36
up. That was the journey to get to here.
1:53:42
It was a journey of years. But you know what? Every story in the
1:53:49
Bible, every um hero of faith that we have in the Bible, they went through the
1:53:55
same kind of journey, didn't they? They went through the same kind of
1:54:01
journey of being very uncomfortable, of having to choose God's will instead
1:54:06
of their own, of having to go through trial after trial like they never experienced until
1:54:13
they stepped into their calling.
1:54:18
People trying to kill them sometimes. People making up lies about them sometimes.
1:54:24
people doing everything in their might to stop them from being who God called them to be.
1:54:31
This these are the stories we have in the Bible. But we see that they chose to
1:54:37
believe in God, trust God, and they chose to keep obeying him.
1:54:44
And that obedience turned into perseverance. It led to perseverance.
1:54:50
That obedience led to perseverance and endurance. which led them to overcome, see the
1:54:58
victories of God, see the promises fulfilled in God's perfect timing.
1:55:04
And when that happens, we see we see blessings. We see miracles. We
1:55:10
see awe and wonder, the the goodness of God, the
1:55:16
faithfulness of God revealed in a way that shocks us to this day when we read their stories.
1:55:22
It amazes me reading the stories in the Bible of David how he was hunted for
1:55:29
many years by Saul because of jealousy.
1:55:35
He was not just hunting him to put him in prison. He was hunting in him to kill him. He Saul had armies that were trying
1:55:44
to find David in caves, trying to find him to kill him.
1:55:50
And God allowed this to happen for years.
1:55:55
But he chose to keep trusting God, trusting the prophecy that prophet
1:56:01
Samuel prophesied to him about his calling that he would become an anointed king to do the Lord's work. He kept
1:56:09
trusting God even though it was hard, even though it was uncomfortable.
1:56:14
And in God's perfect timing, as years passed, after he endured,
1:56:19
God started bringing people alongside David, God started
1:56:26
bringing soldiers, warriors to stand with David. God started bringing
1:56:32
thousands of people here, thousands of people here to stand beside David.
1:56:38
And that's what led him to be king because an army got behind him.
1:56:44
And they could see spiritually the truth
1:56:49
that David was truly anointed king and they wanted God's will to be done. And
1:56:54
David had a pure heart that could lead them well. He was a man after God's heart.
1:56:59
And so God supernaturally brought many people, many warriors, many thousands of
1:57:06
warriors just came and stood with David and fought with David until there was
1:57:14
victory, until the day that God placed David as king.
1:57:22
It was over. The hiding in caves was over one day in God's perfect timing.
1:57:29
the running away, hiding, the waiting. It was over. It passed.
1:57:37
And we see the goodness of God, the faithfulness of God to bring about that promise in David's life. It It makes me
1:57:43
It leaves me in awe and wonder to read that Bible story today. How about you? Fills me with faith. that fills me with
1:57:50
with with just awe of our God, of how great he is, of how faithful he is to move mountains,
1:57:58
to do wonders, to make sure his promises are fulfilled, defeating every giant,
1:58:05
every enemy that comes in the way. Amen.
1:58:10
Hallelujah. It says in Romans 5:3,
1:58:17
"With joy, let us exalt in our exalt means triumphant elation or jubilation.
1:58:25
But with joy, let us exalt in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships, knowing that hardship, distress,
1:58:31
pressure, trouble produces patient endurance." and endurance, proven character,
1:58:39
spiritual maturity, and proven character, hope, and confident assurance.
1:58:45
Such hope in God's promises never disappoints us because God's love has
1:58:52
been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who is given to us.
1:58:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this says that we should have joy
1:59:07
when we go through hard things, when we go through trials.
1:59:15
What? But that's the opposite of how you feel.
1:59:20
What? How does this make sense? Whenever you share with somebody things
1:59:27
you're going through, they do the opposite of joy. They have pity. Oh, I'm sorry.
1:59:33
We'll pray for that to go away. Sometimes God wants it there.
1:59:41
Sometimes we are supposed to have joy for this trial and tribulation.
1:59:47
People could have pity on me just being faithful, just being obedient, receiving the prophecy. Four
1:59:55
years later, the church dwindles down to two people. People could feel sorry for
2:00:01
me. People could think, "What is going on?" Trying to figure this out. This
2:00:06
doesn't make sense. How could God not bless her and bring increase
2:00:13
because she's being faithful? That's the natural reaction. That's the natural reaction when you see
2:00:20
trials and tribulations. That's not God. We got to pray for this to go away.
2:00:29
But we are supposed to have joy. We are supposed to have joy
2:00:36
in sufferings and hardships. But it tells us why have joy because the
2:00:44
hardship, the distress, the pressure, the trouble produces
2:00:51
patient endurance. It forms in you the ability to have
2:00:57
patience and to endure. And that quality is needed
2:01:06
to have spiritual maturity, the character of Christ,
2:01:12
to be patient, to persevere, to be strong, to keep
2:01:17
trusting in God and keep obeying him and keep doing what he's telling you to do no matter what. That character in you is
2:01:25
needed. How does that character come? It comes from the sufferings and hardships,
2:01:30
the distress, pressure and trouble that produces the patient endurance which
2:01:36
which is that spiritual maturity and proven character. Hallelujah.
2:01:43
And as you have the spiritual maturity now because you have gone through these hard things, it produces hope.
2:01:55
It makes you more spiritual to have more hope because you see as you keep obeying God
2:02:01
through the hardships, you you you find that he still blesses you.
2:02:07
He's still with you. He still gives you peace. He still gives you joy.
2:02:13
And as you obey God always, it it opens up your spiritual eyes more. You will you will experience more of God's
2:02:20
presence. You will experience more of God's nearness when you obey God.
2:02:26
The pure in heart shall see God. So as you obey God, you have that means there's purity in your heart that is
2:02:32
leading you to obey. So that purity of obeying God no matter
2:02:39
what time and time again makes you to see God more, makes your spiritual eyes to open up more.
2:02:47
And when that happens, hope grows. Faith grows.
2:02:52
Hallelujah. And we need hope in God's to to to to
2:02:59
see the promises of God fulfilled. Hallelujah. So number one,
2:03:06
how to not give up but persevere always
2:03:11
is to renew your mind that when you face hardships, sufferings,
2:03:18
you need to renew your mind that if you are truly surrendered to God, being obedient to God, God is allowing this.
2:03:26
He is allowing this because it's going to produce patient endurance in you that you need.
2:03:34
God wants you to be a leader.
2:03:39
It was the leaders, the world changers that made it in the Bible.
2:03:48
There's a lot of people back then. There's a lot of people that would go to church back then. a lot of people that
2:03:55
believed in God from Old Testament to New Testament times, but only some stories are included. leaders,
2:04:02
leaders of the faith, people that would obey God and go
2:04:09
through the hard things and come out on the other side to reveal how mighty
2:04:15
our God is. How mighty and faithful and triumphant
2:04:21
and victorious our God is. That's what happens when you read every
2:04:27
Bible story. You stand in awe when you get when you read from the beginning to the end of every Bible character. You
2:04:33
stand in awe of God of the of of God's mighty power, the victory, his
2:04:41
faithfulness. That's what you get through the Bible, right? When you read the Bible stories,
2:04:46
you read the story and you're like, "Whoa, God is so much more powerful than the devil."
2:04:53
Look at the devil trying to use Saul. Look at the devil trying to use the Pharisees. Look at the devil trying to
2:04:58
use Goliath. Look at the devil trying to use Joseph's brothers and the woman that
2:05:04
accused Joseph of trying to sleep with her.
2:05:11
You see God come through and bring them victory despite this intense evil coming
2:05:17
towards them. Every time you see God bring victory, vindication, you see the
2:05:24
promises are fulfilled every time. Hallelujah. When you read the Bible, your faith
2:05:32
increases. But it increases because you are looking
2:05:38
at what God has done in a real person's life when they have chosen to obey God
2:05:45
and surrender their life to him. you that that's what makes the Bible so
2:05:51
powerful. It's living. These are real people who lived like you are living
2:05:56
today and you are going through trials today. But those people went through trials back then in their day and God
2:06:05
saw them through. God helped them overcome and brought them victory every time.
2:06:13
Hallelujah. So that's that's why your faith is increased.
2:06:20
Most of the times that your faith is going to be increased when you read the Bible is when you're reading stories of
2:06:26
real people that were not angels. They were human beings like you and me.
2:06:35
That's the power of a life laid down to Jesus.
2:06:40
That's the power of of of being a leader for Jesus. That's the power of obeying
2:06:47
God even through the hard things. You keep obeying him,
2:06:52
he transforms you to be a leader who can lead to many people's lives coming to
2:06:59
Jesus and having faith in Jesus and not giving up and being able to fulfill
2:07:06
their purpose on this earth because you are a modernday Bible story.
2:07:18
So, we have joy now
2:07:24
because I hate to I don't mean I hate to break it to you, but I'll break it to you that
2:07:32
there's not a single believer's life in the past, present time, including you, and in the future, who is exempt from
2:07:39
going through hardships and suffering. There's not a single believer who has
2:07:45
ever been and who whoever will be exempt from fighting in the spiritual realm
2:07:52
from coming up against attacks from the devil.
2:07:57
And no matter what in the past from the Old Testament to New Testament, the most
2:08:02
anointed ones were were were the biggest threat to the devil. And so therefore,
2:08:08
he tried to take them down. He he he he he he he put his biggest efforts towards
2:08:13
the most anointed ones from Old Testament to New Testament. And that continues to be the same today and will
2:08:20
continue to be the same when we're long gone and in heaven with Jesus on this earth.
2:08:28
Nobody's exempt, no anointed servant of God is exempt from going through trials,
2:08:35
going through attacks from the devil that God allows
2:08:44
to to create, to form patient endurance,
2:08:49
to mold our character, to refine us, to be more like him,
2:08:55
to be these examples for many people in the world of how good our God is, how
2:09:01
faithful our God is, how mighty our God is, how victorious our God is.
2:09:08
So that's how it is in life. I will break I broke it to you.
2:09:18
Like we should read the Bible and we should like you should have your eyes opened up like this is how it works.
2:09:25
This is the life we live in. The devil attacks and God allows some of it, some
2:09:31
of the attacks as a refining fire.
2:09:36
But many people, they they they don't see things that way. They just see just
2:09:43
one-sided one thing. Devil's attacking. Oh, God, take away these attacks. What's
2:09:48
happening? Woe is me. When you're supposed to be rejoicing.
2:09:56
God's allowing it. I'm telling you, I say this a lot, but I you need to know this. This is one of the most powerful things you can know that will create so
2:10:04
much peace in you and strength and joy is that when you are truly surrendered
2:10:10
to God, obedient to God, anything
2:10:16
bad that's happening in life, any suffering, any hardship, any trouble,
2:10:21
God's allowing it for your good if it's happening.
2:10:26
Now, if people are not surrendered and they're open up doors, that's different. Devil's attacking unnecessarily.
2:10:34
So, now you're having so many attacks that you're not even able to experience peace and joy. Where when you are
2:10:39
keeping doors shut to the devil, attacks come from time to time. God allows those attacks for your good, but you there's
2:10:46
grace upon you to have peace and joy and to not be taken down by the storms, to
2:10:51
not be slowed down by the storms, but to be able to keep going and be
2:10:57
strong for the Lord. Keep doing the work of God and keep your peace and joy. Hallelujah.
2:11:04
Praise God.
2:11:09
So, um, you have to renew your mind. You should be renewing your mind whenever you're
2:11:15
going through hard things that God is building you to be a leader
2:11:21
that can lead many to Jesus. In order for you to be a leader that can
2:11:26
lead many to Jesus, you have to overcome trials.
2:11:31
You have to be stretched. That's the only way you can really be a leader and really be effective in the
2:11:38
kingdom of God to lead many to Jesus. Amen. Um
2:11:45
I you know you have to have in your heart and this is what I had in my heart. This is what I had in my heart
2:11:52
through those hard times through those years. I had God gave me the grace to give me this understanding that I'm
2:11:57
sharing with you now to know I I would renew my mind of the story of Joseph and how it felt it
2:12:04
looked like he was going backwards but he was getting closer and closer to the promised land was the reality when he was thrown in the pit when he was sold
2:12:10
into slavery when he went into prison that looks like he's going backwards not just staying stagnant instead of going
2:12:16
closer to the promised land but that looks like he's going backwards right and so I would renew my mind with that
2:12:22
all the time that story in the Bible, I would renew my mind and I would I would
2:12:28
think to myself, I would rem I would renew my mind with this truth. This is going to be a powerful testimony
2:12:34
someday that's going to bless a lot of people, that's going to increase faith in a lot of people. That's going to lead
2:12:40
a lot of people to Jesus. It's going to it's going to open their eyes to see how faithful our God is.
2:12:48
So what would what would help me persevere is I would renew my mind to
2:12:53
that truth. I want people to see how good God is. I
2:12:59
want people to see how faithful God is. I want people to see how victorious God
2:13:05
is. That you don't have to be afraid of the devil. That you don't have to be afraid of Goliath's coming up against
2:13:11
you. If you want that, then you shouldn't be complaining about trials,
2:13:20
you shouldn't be complaining about a Goliath that comes before you
2:13:25
because you need to come up against Goliath and overcome for people to see
2:13:31
the goodness and faithfulness and victory of God through your life
2:13:41
Because you can say, "God is good. I'm blessed." And a person can be like, "Yeah, amen. Amen. I'm encouraged 1%."
2:13:51
But like when you tell someone what you've been through,
2:13:56
when you show someone what you've been through, where God has brought you from,
2:14:02
the enemies that came up against you, and God brought you victory every time, that person's eyes will open up in the
2:14:10
spiritual realm, and their faith will be will be increased like 100%.
2:14:17
That's the effect you can have. Anybody want to have a greater effect, lead more
2:14:22
people to Jesus? So that people can see just how good and faithful our God is.
2:14:28
Amen.
2:14:36
Hebrews 10:35. So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great
2:14:43
reward it brings you. Patient endurance is what you need now so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will
2:14:50
receive all that he has promised. This is why you need to never give up because you won't receive the promises
2:14:57
and you won't please God. This is why you need to persevere so you
2:15:03
can be in God's will and so you will see the promises fulfilled. Simple.
2:15:09
People have asked me before, did you ever think about giving up? And I told
2:15:14
them no. The thought never even crossed my mind.
2:15:20
I never had the temptation. I never wanted to. I never was like, "Oh, I want to do this, but I can't. I want to give
2:15:28
up. I want to start doing my music again, but I can't." It was not even that.
2:15:35
You know, Mary, when when when the angel appeared to Mary, she said and and told
2:15:40
Mary, "You're called to carry the the Messiah."
2:15:46
And Mary says, "I'm a servant of the Lord. Let it be done to me. Let God's will be done in my life. Let God's will
2:15:52
be done." Very simple. Very simple. Servant-hearted.
2:15:59
So humble. Like, I don't have a say in this. I want God's will to be done. Simple.
2:16:06
there's no other alternative. There's no other option. And by God's grace, he he helped me to
2:16:12
have that kind of heart. That's a big key of how I I never gave up is that to me that was never an
2:16:19
option. That was never an alternative. That was hell. To not be in God's will, to not be
2:16:24
pleasing him, that's hell. That's hell on earth and could lead to
2:16:31
hell in eternity. But like just even to take a step out of
2:16:37
God's will once in a while because it feels more comfortable. This wasn't an option for me.
2:16:45
And like I would never even utter words like I really don't like to preach. I really
2:16:53
feel like I'm a bad preacher. I would feel these things. I really don't want to go to church and
2:17:00
preach today. I never would utter those things. I really don't know how this is going to
2:17:06
work. This doesn't seem to be working. We're getting smaller and smaller each year. I wouldn't utter those things even
2:17:11
to one person, even to my parents. I wouldn't say it to my spiritual father
2:17:17
as a way for him to encourage me. No, I knew that that would be speaking words
2:17:22
of death over myself. I knew that that would be displeasing to God because I knew that that wasn't true.
2:17:27
I mean, I know I knew that that what I mean is God called me to be an apostle. God said these things will happen.
2:17:34
That's that. So, if I feel like I'm not good enough,
2:17:39
I'm believing a lie of the devil. I know that's not true. I feel it, but I
2:17:44
know it's not true. I knew this. So, I knew if I confessed things like this,
2:17:50
it's opening the door to the devil and is speaking lies. And it's disrespectful to God because I know better.
2:17:58
Amen. And so that's why I never even um heard
2:18:04
thoughts like I never even had the thought about giving up. Even in the really hard
2:18:09
times, even when we dwindle down to two people, one person leaves in the middle of the message. I never even had that
2:18:15
thought because the door was shut. That's the power of your words. If I had started complaining even a
2:18:21
little bit, even to just one person, even to just my parents, the devil hears you speaking on his frequency.
2:18:29
When you speak negative words, it's like a radio. It's like now those words can be heard. He can't be spying on you.
2:18:35
He's not omnipresent. But when you go to his frequency, he can hear it and then
2:18:41
send specific attacks knowing exactly how to attack you. So, I'm not exaggerating. I literally
2:18:48
never like complained or spoke doubt or spoke I wish I could just not do this. I
2:18:54
wish this wasn't my calling. I never spoke that. And so a thought never even came to my
2:19:01
mind. Give up. To me it was non-negotiable. There's no other option.
2:19:07
I must be in God's will. Amen. And so in the valleys, in the
2:19:13
wilderness, in the trials, that's God's will.
2:19:18
We want the mountaintop time, but it's valley time sometimes. And in the valley time, that's God's will. There is no
2:19:26
other place to be. It shouldn't exist in your mind. It should not exist in your
2:19:33
mind. You should have that fear of God in your heart that you literally cannot
2:19:38
go anywhere else but God's will. Absolutely not. That's like stepping
2:19:44
into hell. It's like putting your foot in fire of hell. You should have that fear of God's
2:19:51
seriousness in your heart. And it's the truth because you're dabbling. If you do that, if you step
2:19:58
out of God's will, you're opening up doors to the devil. where in God's will is peace, joy,
2:20:04
abundant life. Through all those trials I went through, I never had depression. I never had anxiety. I never had
2:20:10
suicidal thoughts. I had nothing but peace and joy.
2:20:16
I was in discomfort. There was suffering as it talks about, but I had peace and
2:20:22
joy through the suffering. If that makes sense, because Jesus gives you a supernatural
2:20:27
peace that doesn't make sense when you go through really hard things. doesn't feel good. Like getting stubbing
2:20:35
your toe or something doesn't feel good, but you still have peace. The pain goes away after a second. That's how it is
2:20:42
with God. Rather than being in agonizing pain every second, the suffer that's our
2:20:48
suffering and through Christ. It's like stubbing your toe. It stings at first,
2:20:53
but you keep your eyes on Jesus and that pain goes away fast.
2:21:00
Amen. Hallelujah.
2:21:10
James 1:12, "God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward, they will receive the crown
2:21:16
of life that God has promised to those who love him."
2:21:23
Something I I want you to know is that
2:21:29
the blessings and rewards that are coming to you after you endure,
2:21:35
after you go, after you overcome these trials, the blessings and rewards that
2:21:41
God is ready to pour upon your life, they are so great. They are beyond what
2:21:46
you can imagine. They are greater than your wildest dreams.
2:21:52
And not just the blessings and the rewards, not just doors opening up and
2:21:57
certain blessings happening and desires of your heart happening, but the blessing and reward of the of peace and
2:22:04
joy of unexplainable peace and joy.
2:22:10
That's the greatest reward that comes. I mean, as you as the more you obey God
2:22:17
and overcome hard things, he makes you more like him. So, the more you become more like him, the more full of peace
2:22:23
and joy you are. Like my spiritual father when when Jesus appeared to him,
2:22:30
um he saw Jesus's face. He saw him from from like from like from here up and he
2:22:37
said that he smiled as if everything was perfect in the world.
2:22:42
Jesus did. The smile of Jesus was the joy he's never seen.
2:22:52
So that means that the more we become more like Jesus through obeying him, especially through obeying him through
2:22:59
hard things, the more like him we become, which means the more joy
2:23:05
we will have, the more peace.
2:23:12
And then when other trials arise, it's a whole different ballgame.
2:23:17
That's what I've experienced. I am so much more relaxed, peaceful, and
2:23:22
joyful when trials come now than I was a few years ago.
2:23:31
But that's the reward of persevering through the hard things.
2:23:40
So, if you ever have a temptation to quit, know that the comfort and good
2:23:45
feeling you'll have of quitting that you think you'll have when you quit.
2:23:53
Know that it is not worth it. Know that the blessings and rewards
2:23:58
coming are so much greater than the comfort and happiness you think
2:24:06
you'll feel when you quit and instead go after your desires and your dreams.
2:24:13
The blessing and rewards are so great. God does not forget what you have gone
2:24:19
through, what you have done for him. He does not forget a second of it. and
2:24:25
he will reward you for all of it greatly in heaven and on this earth. Hallelujah.
2:24:38
And um there's a principle of sacrifice that
2:24:43
anything great comes with sacrifice. It doesn't come cheaply.
2:24:50
The first time I I I would speak to my spiritual father often and I would receive through him mightily, but the
2:24:57
first time that I saw God move in power through me at a church service at our
2:25:04
church service years ago and it never stopped since that day. It kept growing. The first time that happened was the
2:25:13
Sunday after I traveled all the way to Tanzania to go to his church and to
2:25:19
receive impartation. And I received impartation.
2:25:25
God purposely does things this way where he leads us to make a sacrifice to get the
2:25:33
greater things. Sacrifice in our obedience, our surrender in every way. That includes
2:25:39
waiting, persevering through hard things, making that kind of sacrifice, sowing
2:25:45
financially in every way that it's a sacrifice, your obedience and surrender to God.
2:25:51
And so the great blessings now that God is pouring out in this revival in my life,
2:25:59
it has come because there was a cost. There's a cost to the anointing.
2:26:06
These hardships, this suffering for years was the cost I had to pay
2:26:15
for this power of God to be moving like it is.
2:26:21
So you should know, you should count the cost and not expect things to come cheaply
2:26:28
like through a microwave.
2:26:34
You need to see the great promises of God that he's given you as valuable and
2:26:39
treat it as such. And the Bible says, "For where your
2:26:45
treasure is, there your heart will also be." Matthew 6:21.
2:26:53
I put my treasure, my life, my time, my my everything, my I laid down my career
2:27:00
and every my pursuit of my career, money. I put everything into what God called me to do into this
2:27:08
calling. And as I did that, supernaturally, that became my treasure.
2:27:17
Where you put your heart, your treasure will be. So now I have great value.
2:27:23
I I see myself like I see myself. I I I see the sneaky ways of the devil, how he
2:27:28
uses people, how he's used Pharisees and stuff. And I I've received so much wisdom. My spiritual father has given me
2:27:34
so much wisdom in like, you know, just
2:27:41
doing our part to not reveal God's plan so the devil can try to come in and use
2:27:46
people and hijack it. You know what I'm saying? Like I we walk in this this I have to
2:27:52
walk in this wisdom with the devil's strategies and plans knowing them knowing what he's trying to do and not
2:27:59
giving him too much information things like this you know and I have so much care so much
2:28:08
seriousness to do everything I can to be perfectly
2:28:13
in God's will so that God can bring victory every time. The devil cannot get any inch.
2:28:23
The way I handle situations, the way I shepherd and and and care for people, I
2:28:30
do it with such seriousness. Putting my heart into it. It's not casual. The work of God is not casual.
2:28:39
It's very serious. We cannot be out of order. We must be
2:28:45
loving to one another. We must be united. The work of God has to go forth.
2:28:51
I need to minister no matter how how I feel. No matter if I'm tired or what have you.
2:28:58
The work of God must go forth. And everything else comes second. I must
2:29:03
deny myself. Like this seriousness has come from putting my heart to the work
2:29:09
of God by sacrificing, sacrificing, going through hard things. That
2:29:16
seriousness, that passion for God's work, for God's people, that doesn't
2:29:22
come automatically. That's just not born in somebody. It comes through going through these
2:29:30
hard things and choosing to continually give everything. Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
2:29:36
Sacrifice. Sacrifice time. Sacrifice your dreams. Sacrifice your desires.
2:29:42
Sacrifice your feelings. Sacrifice your money. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Sacrifice.
2:29:48
Sacrifice it all. When you do that, God builds this heart in you for passion,
2:29:56
fire, seriousness for Jesus, for his people,
2:30:01
for his kingdom. If you see that in me, if you see this
2:30:07
seriousness, if you see this fire, passion, that's how it happened.
2:30:16
That's why we should be joyful when we go through hardships, when God's asking
2:30:21
us to sacrifice, when God's asking us to to to to pay the cost
2:30:29
of being a leader in the faith. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:30:36
Galatians 6:9. So, let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time, we will
2:30:43
reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up. at just the right time in God's perfect
2:30:50
timing. You know, for years, for four and a half years, every year that New Year's would
2:30:56
come, I would think to myself, I really hope this is the year that the promises come to pass. I really hope this is the
2:31:03
year. Instead of being like, I don't know if this is the year,
2:31:09
I would feel, I really hope this is the year.
2:31:15
But now I look back and I'm so grateful that I waited as long as I did.
2:31:21
That I waited four and a half years. Because I had no idea how many people
2:31:28
needed my testimony. I've heard many of your testimonies of how your my my story
2:31:33
my God's story the God's story in my life has helped you so much has helped
2:31:41
your faith increase has helped you trust God more. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I
2:31:47
had no idea. I knew it was going to help people. That's what encouraged me that I was going through these hard things. But
2:31:53
I had no idea the extent of how people needed it. And so I I I I just look back
2:31:58
and I'm like, what if the story was different? What if it was only one year of waiting?
2:32:03
It wouldn't carry as much weight and power, would it? Or what if the church kept growing every
2:32:09
year, maybe only by a few people instead of decreasing? Wouldn't carry much power? Wouldn't it
2:32:15
carry as much weight? Wouldn't it be as much of a Bible come alive story like David and David and Joseph and Jesus and
2:32:23
the disciples, right? So now when I share my testimony, my
2:32:29
favorite parts to share is the long waiting and the decreasing in number. I
2:32:36
say every time I share my story, I have to say we started at 20, then we went to
2:32:42
15, then went to 10, then went to five. Cuz I know they'll I know they'll be like, whoa.
2:32:48
I know it's shocking. I know it'll help people. I know it'll
2:32:53
really encourage people because most people haven't experienced that kind of like decrease. So what about their life?
2:33:00
Now they can believe God will come through for me too.
2:33:07
It's my that's part of my favorite story is saying that be just because I know
2:33:12
the weight of it is going to help people. I always make sure I share that part. I love sharing about that woman
2:33:19
that left in the middle of the sermon because I just I just know it's going to encourage somebody to not give up. Thank
2:33:26
God that happened. Thank God that happened. That hard thing happened.
2:33:31
I get so excited to share on my 30th birthday, January 1st, the video went
2:33:37
viral and that was the walls of Jericho moment.
2:33:44
I get excited because it shows the sovereignty of God. It shows how he had
2:33:51
every detail mapped out. It shows that he was not late.
2:33:58
It shows that all the world logically would say, "You're doing something wrong. Something's not working."
2:34:04
But it shows that God was right on time. It shows that there was no need for me
2:34:10
to stress or worry or wonder, do I need to do something different? Am I doing something wrong? Am I not doing things
2:34:15
good enough? Am I not preaching good enough? Is that why this is happening? It shows. No, God's timing is perfect
2:34:23
and is a longer timeline than yours usually. But he has a reason for doing
2:34:28
it when he does it, for releasing the promise when he has it planned. We don't see it in the past in the we don't see
2:34:35
it in the moment but when you look back when I look back now my birthday my 30th
2:34:40
birthday which 30 it was the age that so many people in the Bible David became
2:34:46
king right was age 30 Joseph became to his um position finally the dream was
2:34:52
fulfilled at age 30 Jesus was age 30 when he started his ministry
2:34:57
those promises were filled in their lives at age 30 and they began what God called them to to minister, to do the
2:35:04
work at age 30. And so it was on my 30th birthday and it just shows, look how
2:35:09
intentional God is. How perfect his timing is. Hallelujah.
2:35:18
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. So now I am so um peaceful.
2:35:27
I am so peaceful in the in the waiting now. I mean I'm in waiting again. I mean, most of us will be in waiting in
2:35:32
some area in our lives because there's always more promises to come, right? So, I'm in waiting right now for other
2:35:38
aspects of this revival in my personal life, desires of my heart, promises um
2:35:45
that I'm waiting for God to fulfill. Still, I'm waiting. I have no idea when it's coming because that's what God does
2:35:50
so that he can build our faith. He doesn't reveal everything. But I'm so peaceful.
2:35:56
I'm so peaceful now. I'm so peaceful. I I I I now my faith is
2:36:02
built good. Like now I have another testimony to share of more years waiting
2:36:08
for this when I thought it was going to come way sooner. Yes, I see what God's doing. I see what he's doing. All right,
2:36:14
God. You can you can keep going if you need to. So different from back before I
2:36:21
knew how perfect God's ways were when I was like let it be the sheer please.
2:36:30
So I want to share with you today I know I I want you to see this as a real life Bible a Bible come alive example today.
2:36:39
I want you I want your faith to be lifted
2:36:44
because God wants you to rest and have peace and have joy in the waiting in the
2:36:50
turbulent times in the storms. You can have this. There's no need to worry.
2:36:56
There's no need to be impatient. There's definitely no need to rush God. That's a waste of time and it's stupid.
2:37:03
It doesn't make sense. It's a waste of time. rest. Enjoy life with Jesus.
2:37:12
Be a brighter light because you'll have more peace and joy. As you rest, I'm
2:37:19
telling you, God knows what he's doing. If you are in this revival, God sees you and he has things planned
2:37:27
for you. He's going to reveal certain things that is perfect timing for your life, just like he did for me.
2:37:32
My spiritual father, my spiritual father, prophet Jordani, he um you know, he walks in this mighty
2:37:42
anointing and God told him that there would be an ali like like an Elisha, like someone he would pass down the
2:37:47
anointing like like Elijah to Elisha. And God told him this year like many
2:37:55
years before it happened. And so, but but even though he's a prophet and prophets, it's so shocking the details
2:38:01
that they see for the sake of ministry for other people. But what's so powerful about this is that God doesn't reveal
2:38:06
everything to everyone, even prophets, for their own personal life, because he wants them to walk in faith, too, and
2:38:13
for them to be able to encourage people like me someday with what they
2:38:18
persevered, how they kept their faith. And so he went to America several times
2:38:24
for several years wondering who this person was, looking,
2:38:30
wondering because God told him this was going to happen. There's going to be someone. So he literally ministered in
2:38:36
America, ministered in Minnesota. He ministered in Oakland. He ministered in Minnesota several times for years
2:38:42
wondering. And then one day in 2016, he told God
2:38:47
told him, "You're going to find the person this time, this trip, this time
2:38:53
you minister." Didn't reveal the details until he saw
2:38:58
me. And when he saw me, he said it was like a movie, like he could see the future. Like he knew. Glory to God.
2:39:07
Glory to God. But you you see, at that time when God told him that, I was not even surrendered to God yet. I was in
2:39:13
college. I was being lukewarm in some areas. But God had this plan. He had this plan
2:39:20
where he was going to put in my heart, move to LA. I thought it was for acting.
2:39:25
God used it. God had this plan. I'm going to get her
2:39:31
to go to this conference in September 18th, 2016.
2:39:37
And I never struggled to get anywhere so much in my life. My GPS took me three different places. It was supernatural.
2:39:42
demonic supernatural, but I kept persevering, didn't give up, and God got
2:39:48
me there. But in the same way, God sees you. He He
2:39:54
He He knows what he's going to speak to you about your life, about your calling.
2:40:01
For example, he has already planned the day, just like he had a plan for me. He had that day planned out in his book, in
2:40:06
his book years ago, September 18th, 2016. He had that plan. He had a plan.
2:40:12
and I'm going to send my prayer from Tanzania, East Africa to LA.
2:40:18
He moved things. I I had other things going on in my life that time. He made a relationship end so that my calendar was
2:40:24
clear and I was in the need of seeking God cuz I was so disappointed like never before.
2:40:29
He made sure that happened and my my calendar was clear and I was in the position to seek God so I would make it
2:40:35
there. And so I'm telling you, you are no
2:40:42
different than me. God sees you and he knows the exact plan for your life. He
2:40:51
knows the exact day that he is going to release a prophecy it may be or he's
2:40:56
going to release a word to you to catapult you into a certain calling of your life. He knows the day he's going
2:41:03
to bring uh uh pro the promises that you've been waiting on all your life. He knows the day. He knows the day you'll
2:41:10
have your first child. He He knows the day.
2:41:16
He has it planned. And when you surrender to God, he's going to get you there. He's going to
2:41:23
get you there. You don't have to worry about a thing. He's going to get you there. I'm telling you, I've seen him do
2:41:30
it in my life. And he loves you. And he cares about you. And he has great plans for you as he did for me.
2:41:38
Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
2:41:46
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. We're going to give to God right now.
2:41:53

2:41:59
As you give, I want to encourage you to put your heart where God is leading you
2:42:05
to to to have your treasure [Music]
2:42:11
because this is an action you need to take. You need to choose to put your heart to Jesus, to his work.
2:42:21
If you want any change in your life, I encourage you to sew a seed with the prayer request of this change to come in
2:42:27
your life, to come in your heart. Amen.
2:42:33
That you would not have any temptation to complain, any temptation to quit,
2:42:39
but that you would be strong to persevere and persevere again.
2:42:46
that the most important thing in your life would be to be in God's will every
2:42:52
second, every day. [Music]
2:42:57
If you feel like that's not the case right now, but you want that your heart to be that way, I encourage you to sew a
2:43:03
seed with that prayer request and to pray this to God, to pray this from your heart.
2:43:10

you stand against the devil and say, "I want
2:44:34
revival in my city, in my nation. Devil, I will pay the price. You can't
2:44:42
have your way. Jesus is worth it all. I will pay the price of of making a
2:44:48
sacrifice, of surrendering everything, and saying revival must take place in my
2:44:54
city, in my nation." Amen. God moves upon this sacrifice

will, to have this heart that the worst thing in the world is to step outside of
2:45:47
God's will in any way. The worst thing in the world is to make a mistake. Not saying we you have to be perfect, but
2:45:53
just like to have that intention. I want to please God with everything in me.

Corporate Prayer
3:15:08
upon everyone here and watching. If any of you need deliverance, if anyone of you need healing, I encourage you to
3:15:15
renounce right now whatever the sickness is, whatever the oppression is, as you
3:15:20
do this, this unlocks a key for you to be free. As you do this, you're walking
3:15:25
in your authority in Christ and kicking out the devil and saying, "I don't want your portion, devil. I want God's portion over my life of healing and
3:15:32
freedom." That's the power of renouncing. So, I encourage you to speak that aloud right now if you need to.
3:15:39
Those of you watching online, renounce right now. Lift your hands right now to receive this power of God.
3:15:46
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. I speak right now that every generational
3:15:53
curse must be broken. I break every curse of witchcraft. I break every word
3:15:58
curse and every demonic soul tie. And I detach you from what you have renounced

3:16:11
infirmities must go. I declare everything that came from trauma and abuse, it must go. I declare all
3:16:18
depression must go. All anxiety must go in Jesus name. I declare everything that
3:16:23
came from the devil to try to to push you down with heaviness of
3:16:29
discouragement, it must go now in Jesus' name. Every discouraging lie of the
3:16:36
devil about your future and about your identity in Christ, it must go now in
3:16:41
Jesus' name. I declare all of that heaviness that you have had through
3:16:47
going through hard things, through going through suffering, through going through hardship, that heaviness that you had
3:16:53
without the revelation that you should rejoice, that heaviness that has come,
3:16:58
that depression, that despair, that anxiety. This must leave you now. These suicidal
3:17:05
thoughts, these thoughts of death must go now in Jesus' name. And I declare
3:17:11
every spirit of jealousy, every spirit of pride that is holding you back, it
3:17:17
must go now in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. I declare all religion, all
3:17:24
condemnation, it must go in Jesus' name. I speak all witchcraft, it must go in
3:17:30
Jesus' name. Now, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
3:17:36
Hallelujah. I speak right now for every spirit attached to what you've
3:17:42
renounced. It must leave every person here and watching
3:17:48
now in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. I speak healing in the head. Someone needs
3:17:56
healing in their head. Be healed right now in Jesus' name. Be healed. I declare to him in Jesus' name, I see someone ear
3:18:04
ringing. This ringing must stop. Be healed in Jesus' name. I see someone
3:18:10
with uh bad eye pressure in their eyes. You have to take drops. I speak healing
3:18:16
to you. You do no longer need those drops now in Jesus' name. Fibromyalgia
3:18:22
must go in Jesus' name. Endometriosis must go in Jesus' name. Someone gets
3:18:27
gassy cramps all the time when they eat. They're constantly having cramps. They're constantly feeling bloated every
3:18:33
time they eat. It's a digestion issue with you. I speak healing now in Jesus'
3:18:38
name. There's someone with trial. I forget the name of it, but you pull out your hair. You pull out the eyelashes.
3:18:45
God's healing somebody of this right now. Be healed now in Jesus' name. Thank
3:18:50

3:19:59

3:20:04
increase in Jesus' name. And I speak that impartation of anointing would come
3:20:10
