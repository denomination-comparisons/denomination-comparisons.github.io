Message
0:00
So this message I've titled navigating relationships wisely. And today I'm
0:05
going to be specifically talking on how to navigate relationship wisely among
0:10
brothers and sisters in Christ among uh those those that you are serving alongside in the church with the work of
0:18
God. Amen. All right. So I have shared a lot about the importance of keeping
0:25
healthy boundaries and not bringing the wrong people in close. Now um Jesus he
0:33
only had three people extremely close to him and that was James, John and Peter.
0:39
We see that at the mount of transfiguration and we see uh at the garden of Gethsemane these three were
0:44
the ones that Jesus chose to be with him in the most intimate of times.
0:50
And we all we then see that the 12 disciples of Jesus only those 12 were semi close to Jesus.
0:58
But Jesus had so many other disciples thousands of disciples but only 12 were
1:04
semi-lose and three were extremely close. So that speaks to us that shows us the
1:11
importance of not bringing in too many people very close. And this this wisdom
1:19
is missing by and large in the body of Christ. This wisdom of being careful to
1:26
follow the Holy Spirit's voice of who to bring close in your life. Because if you have the wrong people close to you, this
1:33
is an an automatic open door for the enemy. A lot of people are lukewarm. A
1:38
lot of believers are lukewarm, not surrendered, have wrong intentions, wrong motives. And when that is the
1:45
case, they are vessels of the enemy. The devil can use them. Not that he not that the devil's like constantly using him,
1:52
using them, but they have an open door. They have an open door. When anyone has
1:58
an open door, it means that the enemy has access to influence a person um at
2:05
times. And so when you you are surrendered to God, the devil is looking
2:12
where he can find access. He's looking where is there an open door? And sometimes believers have all the doors
2:18
shut except for they have the wrong pe person close to them. And so the wrong
2:24
person close to them can speak negative words and those words can enter them. So
2:30
the person a person can be very diligent at what they're watching, what they're listening to. But one word, negative
2:36
word, dark word coming from a person can
2:41
bring harm, can bring spiritual harm. Uh, and I mean, from a person speaking
2:48
negatively about your identity, maybe something that the enemy had tried so hard to chip away at your identity. Um,
2:55
and and you've been free of this. You've done the spiritual disciplines work to
3:00
reject the devil's lies and renew your mind to the truth. And then here comes somebody close to you that the enemy can
3:09
use to to to speak against your identity when if you didn't bring the wrong person close to you, you wouldn't have
3:15
had to go through that spiritual attack, unnecessary spiritual attack. not a kind of a spiritual attack that God, you
3:22
know, wanted to allow to test you, but you you can be going through unnecessary spiritual attacks that can lead to
3:29
oppression, that can lead to you not having the peace and joy that God wants you to have. So a big part of protecting
3:36
your peace and your joy and what you have received your freedom uh the the
3:42
the the truths about yourself about God about your future a big part of protecting that is by keeping the right
3:50
people close only and not allowing the wrong person into your close circle your
3:57
close like by that I mean that you are you consider them a very close friend where you they have access to you
4:04
they're texting you, calling you, hanging out with you, you know, spending a lot of time with you. That's what I
4:10
mean by someone close. Um,
4:16
and also the person that you bring, the wrong person you bring in close, um, if they have an open door to the enemy, if
4:21
they're not surrendered to God, uh, they can be worldly. They can have lukewarm
4:28
things about them and that their actions, their words that are lukewarm,
4:34
that are worldly can really have an effect on you spiritually.
4:41
You it can start to chip away um like how your flesh has been pushed down and
4:48
your spirit has arose. If you are spending too much time with someone who
4:53
is worldly, who is lukewarm, who has open doors to the enemy, it's like their
4:58
influence is feeding your flesh and diminishing your spirit.
5:04
In the Bible, it says iron sharpens iron. So when when when two people who
5:10
are surrendered to God are friends are are spending time together
5:16
then they sharpen one another. They they it's like one fire two fire put the
5:24
fire together that those both those fires impact each other. The other fire is getting more
5:30
heat from that one fire and this fire is getting more heat from this fire. You encourage one another to stay on track.
5:37
You encourage each other of what is right. Hearing that person speaking the truth that you know to be truth and you
5:43
are living that truth, but it's it reinforces that truth, the the the like the ways of
5:50
God, the ways of God, the spiritual principles of God,
5:56
the importance of obedience, the importance of being in his will, the importance of sacrifice, etc.
6:01
it it reinforces what's already in you. It makes it stronger. And so the
6:07
opposite is true as well. So if you have you have an iron that is you know you
6:14
are let's say you are sharp but then someone you have in close is dull um you
6:19
you will have a good influence on them and sharpen them but they can dull you.
6:26
Now, if you are called to minister to someone, maybe it's someone at the
6:32
workplace where God is calling you to have lunch with them, lunch with them once in a while, spend time with them
6:39
for the purpose of ministry, for the purpose of of being a light and being a vessel of God to lead them to Jesus.
6:47
That's different because you are going in ministry mode and you know this is
6:54
this this purpose of this lunch this purpose of me spending time with this person this person this the purpose of
7:00
this phone call of me listening to this person the struggles they're having me listening the purpose of this is for the
7:06
work of God the purpose of this is not friendship the purpose of this is not fun hang out recreation socializing time
7:16
the purpose of This is to minister to this person. So when you go with that intention,
7:22
that person cannot harm you. But it's when you go with that intention, you've guarded your heart. You you've gone as
7:30
as someone ministering to them. So in the spiritual realm because you are
7:37
doing things the right way like because you are going to minister what they have
7:43
in them can't harm you as long as you really keep in your mind and heart the
7:50
purpose of this interaction with this person. It's like me ministering.
7:56
There's people that can come to church have many demons. There's people that can come to church that are very
8:02
lukewarm. There's people that can come to church with very wrong motives.
8:07
Wrong motives in general, wrong motives towards me. They can come with very wrong motives, but that is not something for me to like fear that they're going
8:13
to affect me. No, no, no, no, no. I am there to minister to them. So, their
8:19
demons do not harm me. They don't affect me. Their lukewarmness doesn't doesn't
8:24
affect me. You know, the the the the wrong intentions, I am protected. But
8:31
that's because it's it's coming in alignment with God's
8:36
kingdom principles of the spiritual realm. Like when you minister, there is a grace and protection over you. So like
8:45
let's say like a demon starts saying um swear words towards me, which has
8:51
happened before several times. Let's say they start saying swear words. They start saying I hate you. They start
8:57
saying horrible things to me. that's not going to affect me. I'm protected.
9:02
Number one. Number two, I know I I'm clear in the spirit. I'm not
9:10
seeing this person as my friend whom I've opened up my heart to whom I put
9:15
trust in where trust like I trust them so that they can then hurt me by their negative words. You see, you see, I know
9:24
I don't have any trust towards this person. I'm simply called to be a vessel of God for this person, you know. So
9:31
that's how it is. So for you, for you like someone in the workplace, maybe God's calling you to pour into them, to
9:37
really listen to them, have a conversation with them maybe more than once.
9:43
You you are in the place of ministering to them. So, you are protected as long as you're serious to stay in line with
9:52
the kingdom laws, the kingdom of God laws, like like you're not
9:58
crossing over the border and going into a gray area and becoming casual with
10:03
them and starting to like halfway ministering to them, halfway friendship
10:08
hangout time. As long as you're diligent to to
10:14
be serious, be professional, be in line with this kingdom principle that I'm
10:19
talking about, you'll be totally protected. And you don't have to this
10:24
doesn't apply this what I'm what I'm teaching you of bringing the wrong people in close and how they can harm
10:29
you. That does not apply in this situation. Hallelujah. So um
10:40
today I I've I've shared a lot about this. Maybe if you have not heard my message about the importance of um
10:46
keeping boundaries, I have a actually a playlist on YouTube that's called um I
10:53
forget what it's called, but I think it's like navigating relationships. I want to say um something about relationships is the name of the
10:59
playlist on my YouTube. Okay. Okay. And so there's a lot of different sermons I have on how how to keep boundaries, how
11:06
to know when to put boundaries up, how to navigate relationships, etc. So go there after this live stream
11:14
if you want to know more on this topic. But today I'm going to be going deeper. I'm going to be speaking specifically on
11:21
how to navigate relationships with believers in whom you are called to the same
11:28
mission. fellow revival warriors in God's army.
11:36
All right. So, John 17:21, it says, "I pray that they will all be one just as
11:41
you and I are one as you are in me, Father, and I am in you.
11:46
And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me."
11:51
So Jesus and the father were one and are one. And so Jesus is praying to the
11:57
father. I pray that my disciples are one. I pray that they are united. That
12:03
they are extremely united. We see we see here the importance of disciples of
12:11
those who are called to the same assignment that they are united.
12:18
So first of all, you need to know this where you are planted, where the the church you were planted, the ministry
12:24
you're planted in this revival, whom you are serving alongside in this work of
12:30
God, whether they're in the same city or across the world. At 5 Church, we have
12:36
people planted from 165 nations. You need to be united. You need to carry
12:44
that in your heart. You need to see the importance of this. The Bible says that a kingdom divided against itself cannot
12:51
stand. So when you have the kingdom of God
12:56
operating in the church and the church members, the the fellow the revival warriors are divided,
13:03
it can't stand strong. The more united we are, the stronger we stand. The more
13:10
united we are, the sh the brighter we shine. The more united we are, the more
13:15
the world will see the light of Jesus in us. The more we are united, the more eyes will open up to see revival is now.
13:22
This is Jesus. And they will want to come and encounter Jesus. The more we
13:28
are united, the more God can do through us. The more doors he can open, the more wonders and miracles he can do, the more
13:34
he can grow and expand his revival, the more we are united. United in heart.
13:40
united in terms of loving one another, truly loving one another. You know
13:46
what's so important is to see your brothers and sisters rightly. Everyone that h that everyone that has stepped
13:52
into this revival, by the way, if you're new here, revival is now. And God is
13:57
restoring all that has been lost in the that we see in the book of Acts such as the power of God such as the foundation
14:04
of the church of how the church should be equipped according to God's blueprint
14:10
his way of equipping his church according to Ephesians Ephesians 4:11 and Ephesians 2:20.
14:17
Apostles and prophets have been missing. God is restoring apostles and prophets to the five-fold ministry. God is
14:22
restoring purity in the body of Christ. God is restoring order. God is restoring
14:29
the new wine. There's so much old wine today in the body of Christ by and
14:34
large. And he is now restoring this new wine. Now,
14:40
every person who has said yes to God, has said yes to his move, his revival,
14:46
has embraced and accepted his revival, has said yes to be a revival warrior who
14:51
was a part of this move of God. every one of them and there's a lot of them all over the world. They are your family
14:58
in Christ and they are valuable. They are special. Every one of you that has
15:03
said yes to God said yes to his this revival. Everything that he's
15:09
doing in revival said yes to deliverance ministry. You said yes to his anointing. You said yes to the weak and foolish
15:16
things he chooses. The anointed servants of God he's risen up. You said yes to the prophetic ministry. You said yes to
15:21
his ways of moving through apostles and prophets. You said yes to his new wine. You are so valuable. You are so
15:29
valuable. I'm telling you because many are called. Few are chosen. Many are called, all believers are called to say
15:36
yes to God in his revival. But so far, few compared to the amount of Christians
15:41
in this world have said yes. There are many. This is a mighty mighty revival
15:46
army. But compared to the amount of Christians in this world, compared to
15:51
the amount of Christians that God has spoken to them in one way or another multiple times, this is my move. This is
15:58
my revival and they've rejected it. You are few. You are the chosen few. So
16:06
that being said, you are so precious. You are so valuable. Every one of you
16:12
revival warriors is so precious and valuable. I can't stress this enough. I can't stress this enough. I'm telling
16:19
you, I I I I know I know there are many hearts out there that
16:25
have pride. There are many hearts out there who have judgment. There are many hearts out there that are choosing a
16:30
different gospel of Jesus than the gospel that Paul preached.
16:36
You know, Paul said, "You are so easy to receive different gospels. People are
16:42
preaching different Jesuses, but you need to remember the Jesus that
16:47
I preached to you. Paul says, and I see this so much today. There is a
16:54
different gospel that people are preaching. People are representing Jesus
17:00
in a way that is not looking like Jesus in different aspects. So many of these
17:06
way, these are the old wine ways. But so many people are
17:11
preaching and believing and living in a different gospel and they're missing
17:19
revival, true revival because they want a different kind of revival that's in
17:25
alignment with their gospel, their gospel of Jesus. their different gospel
17:31
of Jesus that has been formed through culture,
17:37
that has been formed through society, that has been formed through
17:46
the things going on in the news, the culture of today.
17:53
So I I'm telling you, I really want you to know how valuable you are and how
17:58
valuable every revival warrior in this army of God is. We are so big, but it's
18:05
so important to see that there are a lot of people who have not accepted God's
18:10
move yet. They've seen it. They've seen it not just once. They've seen it and God's spoken to them, but they have not
18:17
received it. All right? And so you like how I see you, how I see you is I I
18:23
thank God for you. I bless you. I I know what it was like to
18:30
see God's anointing rejected for many years. I mean, before revival broke out,
18:36
the anointing was moving. Not like it is now, not in the way of deliverance and healing, but his anointing was still
18:43
moving. His prophetic anointing was moving. Baptism Holy Spirit was taking place. and our church would get smaller
18:48
and smaller and smaller by the year for four years and then revival broke out. But like I know I mean I've spent so
18:56
much time wondering are there good hearts out there? Are there hearts out there that are pure and that really just
19:02
want Jesus that really just want him to have his way? That really just want his
19:08
precious pure power. Are there people out there, believers out there who will
19:13
choose Jesus, his power, the the purity of him, the
19:18
Holy Spirit over culture, entertainment,
19:25
popularity, trendiness, like the things that are so common in churches today that have
19:33
replaced the Holy Spirit. I wondered for years, are there people out there? Are
19:40
there people? I'm not seeing them. For four years, I didn't see those hearts.
19:46
I'm not saying obviously they're out there. You're you're there. But for four
19:51
years, I really wondered, do they exist? Do they exist?
19:58
I would share my testimony of my spiritual father, how I've encountered God's power through my spiritual father. I would share it again and again and
20:05
again and again on my social media. I had so many Christian friends and family by that time. So I mean so many I going
20:13
I went to high school, I went to college, I went to two different like study abroad things, trips. Um uh I just
20:22
I had I went to a bunch of different churches when I moved to LA. I had so many different Christian friends in so many different circles. And I'm sharing
20:30
my testimony about how my life has been transformed by the power of God, about
20:35
the power of God moving through my spiritual father. I would share my testimony on social media again and again and again and again. And there was
20:43
like I mean I'm I'm sharing like my life has been changed. The power of God, people
20:49
are being freed. People are being healed. Miracles are happening. And there was just like there's just silence. There's just silence. And so
20:57
I'm telling you, for four years I I went through this season where I was like, do
21:02
these people exist? Do people that really want like does
21:07
anyone want what I want? Does anyone want God's power and purity over this lukewarm
21:14
entertainment driven cu just popularity driven trendiness driven
21:24
and then also religion driven judgment and
21:31
wanting revival to look a certain way without the power of God?
21:37
Do people are there any people who don't want that and want God's power and want the real thing? I'm telling you, I went
21:44
through this for so long, for years, and now I there's there's so many of you. There's so many of you that God has
21:50
brought to this revival army. And so from you, you know, you can see from my perspective, I I I thank God for you. I
21:59
bless you. I see your importance. I see your value to God and his kingdom. I see
22:05
you as leaders on the the front lines of this army, this revival army. I see you
22:11
as the first disciples of Jesus. Like so important. This revival will grow so
22:17
big, but you are here among the first. You're so important. Hallelujah.
22:24
All right. So, all that being said, God wants you to have this perspective for one another, to see one another with
22:31
this value. No matter what, there's going to be mature revival warriors.
22:36
There's going to be baby revival warriors. There's going to be people that have been soaked in the new wine and have transformed so much over the
22:43
course of years. And there's going to be some that are brand new. They just surrendered to God yesterday. Maybe they
22:49
haven't even surrendered to God yet, but they've taken the first step and they've they've said yes to his revival.
22:57
They become planted in a church where God's power is. They are valuable. They
23:03
are valuable because a lot of people say no. And you think about the disciples that
23:08
Jesus called. They were not perfect. Now Peter, I talked about him this past
23:14
Sunday at Fivefold Church. I'm going to share a little more about him. But if you think about Peter, Peter was the one
23:20
that Jesus chose among all disciples among all people to be the rock, the
23:27
foundation, the leader of the first church of the first of of of the church of that
23:34
was the beginning of the body of Christ. He chose Peter. But Peter was not
23:40
perfect. Peter Peter did not change in one day to be like Jesus.
23:46
In fact, he was still making serious mistakes. After three years of following Jesus,
23:58
Peter, there's one time where um I'm going to read the scripture I've read on
24:03
Sunday, Matthew 16:1. From from then on, Jesus began to tell his disciples plainly
24:11
that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the
24:16
elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the third day, he would be raised from the dead.
24:23
Okay, so that's heavy. All right, that that's heavy. He's sharing this. That's heavy, right? That's shocking. That's
24:30
heavy. But he does say on the third day he would be raised from the dead. So he
24:35
didn't leave them on a dark cliffhanger. He told them he would be resurrected. So
24:41
he told them it's God's will that I go through these things. Um but
24:50
there's victory in this. So look, God's hand is on this. Look, God is allowing this for good for a reason.
24:58
Um, so he shares but but still still even though he reveals I'm going to be
25:04
resurrected on the third day. You don't have to wait that long and there will be victory and what a wonder this will be
25:11
and this will be the salvation of souls of your souls and all those to come who
25:17
will say yes to Jesus. But verse 22, but Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him. Peter was reprimanding
25:25
Jesus. Whoa, how prideful. How rude. And this is years after Peter was
25:33
following Jesus. So he reprimands him saying, "Heaven forbid, Lord. This will
25:38
never happen to you." Now your words have power. So
25:46
that's no small thing. That's no small mistake. What Peter just did, what he
25:51
just said. Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Get away from me, Satan. You are
25:57
a dangerous trap to me. You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God's." So Jesus calls
26:04
Peter Satan and then he says, "You are a dangerous trap to me." He says this to
26:10
Peter, "You are a dangerous trap to me." Whoa.
26:17
Okay. So, I I want you to pretend you're a disciple there listening to this. I
26:23
want you to pretend you're not Peter. You're one of the other disciples listening to Jesus. Okay. Well, first of all, you're listening to Paul Peter. And
26:31
you were probably thinking cuz you're quiet. You're just listening humbly, right? But you might be thinking, "Man,
26:37
Peter has pride in him. How could he reprimand Jesus like this?"
26:44
Red flag. you maybe you would have thought that.
26:50
And then Jesus then says, "Get behind me, Satan." So Jesus is calling Peter Satan.
27:02
You might be thinking, "That is a red flag. We got a red flag." And then he says, "You are a dangerous trap to me."
27:10
Peter's a dangerous trap to Jesus. What about us? he must be an even more dangerous trap to us.
27:17
You might be thinking that. And so when you're thinking on this um in the lens
27:23
of on the topic of the importance of keep of of the boundaries to set
27:30
um and who to bring in close. This is where you would probably be thinking red
27:36
flag, red flag, red flag. I need to stay far away from Peter based on all of this
27:42
that just took place. What Peter said, what Peter did, and what Jesus said.
27:49
You know, Peter then cuts off the official's ear that that
27:55
that goes to arrest Jesus. He cuts off the ear
28:01
that you know I mean all these three years we see Jesus not doing anything
28:07
violent anything and not just that but preaching again and again and again how
28:13
his kingdom is not of the kingdoms of this world and we do we do not fight
28:21
with flesh we do not fight with violence I mean he preached this again and again and again and Peter was so quick
28:28
to go in the flesh, go in anger,
28:35
um, and literally cut off the guy's ear. So, the disciples, it was Peter that did
28:42
that. It wasn't the other. So, imagine, imagine you're another disciple and you could, you could be thinking that same thing, like, Peter,
28:50
he seems dangerous to keep I better not keep him close. You could be thinking
28:55
that. So, um, then Peter out of all the disciples is the
29:02
one to deny Jesus three times. Not one, but three times.
29:09
So now people can be thinking, he's he's a coward. He's not courageous. He's not
29:14
bold. He's supposed to be our leader. How could he deny Jesus? Maybe he didn't really love Jesus. I mean, how could you
29:21
deny Jesus? Because all these other disciples, they hid. They ran and hid. And but they weren't they didn't have
29:26
that temptation, that encounter that Peter did where someone saying, you know, asking him, "Weren't you with
29:32
Jesus?" That just didn't that but but but if that happened to them, they probably they might have probably denied Jesus, too.
29:40
But you see how you can be so quick to judge, you know, you can be so it could be easy
29:46
to judge Peter right now. Peter though he was with Jesus for
29:52
three years he was still a work in progress. Transformation to be like Jesus does not
29:58
happen overnight. Does not happen even in three years. It takes time.
30:04
And the more anointed you are, the bigger calling you have, the bigger the enemy is going to attack, the bigger the
30:11
temptations are. So sometimes a person may make a mistake
30:16
um simply because the attack was great towards them.
30:22
But we do not define people by their mistakes. God can redeem anything. God can
30:28
transform anybody. Nobody is too far gone. You look at Paul who used to be Saul. He
30:35
killed many Christians. So he he committed probably the worst kind of crimes, the worst kind of
30:40
mistakes anyone could. But Jesus redeemed him completely, forgave him completely, even gave him the highest
30:46
honor anyone could ever have of being one of the the the highest level
30:54
apostles, servants of God, and writing most of the New Testament, walking in extraordinary
31:00
anointing, Acts 19:11. So, um
31:07
I say all that to say that um
31:13
when you are serving alongside people, believers,
31:19
when you're called to do the work of God together, there can be situations like like Peter.
31:26
There can be situations where you see someone making mistakes that you're not making. Like I want to remind you that
31:33
these mistakes that I just mentioned, the other disciples weren't making them. Yet Peter was chosen to be the leader.
31:41
When people make mistakes, do not define them by that. Their mistakes are not speaking of their future. Sometimes when
31:48
a person makes a mistake, it's a catalyst for them to grow so fast.
31:55
Like it brings the fear of God. It humbles them that they have made this mistake and it awakens them to a
32:01
weakness that they weren't aware of or they they were being lazy about to to to
32:07
to give intention and diligence to work on this weakness to have discipline in this weakness. When they make a mistake,
32:14
when you really love God and you make a mistake, it really instills the fear of God in
32:20
you. And we need the fear of God. So mistakes can be a blessing sometime for
32:25
the purpose of instilling more fear of God in you.
32:30
Um it it can wake you up to to to see you need to take things more seriously.
32:36
Take obeying God really more seriously that it just you know doesn't happen
32:42
automatically or naturally. You know that these weaknesses don't just go away automatically. You have to deny your
32:48
flesh. You have to really make intention for these weaknesses. You have to be diligent to reject the devil's lies. You have to be diligent to listening to the
32:54
teachings where you are planted and especially in an area of weakness to really listen to those teachings apply
33:00
that have to do with that weakness um and apply those teachings, you know. So with Peter um once it's
33:09
time for for him to be an apostle and when the Holy Spirit came and he
33:16
preached that message that brought thousands to Jesus after that we don't
33:21
we don't read about Peter making mistakes. We don't read about that.
33:27
So you can see that all these mistakes that were happening this was part of his process. This was part of his
33:33
transformation. These mistakes did not define him. Did not define his future.
33:41
Did not define his ability to be a great leader, a great servant of God, a
33:46
purehearted, humble servant of God. So if anybody says yes to God's move, to
33:54
God's revival, to his will, then they have great potential. Period.
34:00
They have great potential to be used mightily by God. And we should honor that. We should have
34:07
hope for that. We should desire that in them rather than looking at their
34:14
Peterlike mistakes on the journey there.
34:19
When a person first steps into the revival, first steps into,
34:25
you know, being planted where God's power is moving and accepting his new wine.
34:30
They are babies in Christ because the old wine is so different from the new wine. So you have Christians who've been
34:37
Christians for decades, but they've been many times under a different gospel. So
34:46
for the true gospel of Jesus, the new wine, it's completely new to them. And
34:54
it sometimes can be harder to learn and grow in the new wine when you've been in
34:59
the old wine than if you know knew nothing about Jesus and you came with an open clean slate.
35:05
So that being said, it's very important to have grace for people when they are
35:11
they are new, when they are babies, when they have recently stepped into this move of God.
35:20
have grace for them if they're brand new believers and really have grace for them. Also, if they've been in the old
35:28
wine, if they've been in the old wine for many years, have grace for them
35:35
because it takes time to unlearn all of that old wine junk and receive and learn
35:43
the new wine. So when it comes to um
35:53
when it comes to relationships with people outside of church with outside of
35:58
where you are called to serve and you're serving alongside your brothers and
36:03
sisters. So, we're talking about outside of that, outside of church, it's so important that you really are diligent
36:11
to keep boundaries up and don't waste time spending time with people that aren't aligned with your vision. Like
36:18
maybe somebody is a Christian, they don't have many doors opened and you've been friends with them, but really seek
36:27
God about if you're supposed to still keep this person in close. Like if this person is rejecting God's move,
36:34
you know, is that relationship really sharpening you though? Then is it pushing you
36:41
forward, helping you um fulfill your assignment on this
36:47
earth? Because there's so many people in this world that you could bring in close, but you don't have much time, much capacity
36:54
to bring many people in close. So make those decisions carefully. Make them wisely.
37:00
I would suggest you only keep people in close, very close to you. Those people you keep close to you are those that are
37:08
aligned with the same vision because that's going to be the most kind of iron sharpening iron that's going to
37:14
take place. Um, you're going to be encouraging each other more. You're going to be like more
37:20
on fire for what God has called you to.
37:28
And for people, you know, that aren't um planted where you are planted
37:36
and they they have open doors to the enemy. They are lukewarm. So, this is a different type of person I'm talking
37:41
about right now. Obviously, that is not a person to keep close. That's that's like an obvious one
37:48
because the enemy can really use that person. And for someone who So the first
37:54
example I gave is someone who's maybe not against the move of God, against God's power, against deliverance and
38:00
what God is doing. Maybe they're not against it at all. But I want to talk
38:05
about now another person can be like a Pharisee, like someone that is against God's move. Now that is one of the most
38:12
dangerous people that you can keep in close. Um because God wants to use that or I
38:18
mean the devil wants to use that person to pull you away from your assignment on
38:24
this earth from your calling um to discourage you to confuse you to
38:30
deceive you. So that's a little broad overview of the
38:35
people that you shouldn't keep close in general. Also, this is something I've
38:41
mentioned in the past as well that you'll learn more about in on this playlist. There's a teaching I even share about specifically about
38:47
manipulation, how manipulation um is very dangerous and that's a big red flag of like to make sure that you
38:56
don't keep people in close who are manipulating because the enemy is trying to control
39:01
you through them. I do want to add though like when you are
39:08
you got to separate you got to separate relationships outside of the church where you are
39:14
called where you are planted. You got to separate those relationships like how you navigate those
39:20
relationships, how to keep boundaries up versus um relationships in the church where you are planted.
39:27
Because as I mentioned in the beginning, everyone who is a part of this revival army, they are so valuable. They are so
39:34
important. They can be like Peter making mistakes, but God has great plans to use
39:40
them in the future and even is using them right now. Like all of the disciples, they were being used right
39:46
then and there. Even Judas, Judas was being used by God. Judas w all the
39:53
disciples were assisting Jesus with the ministry everything that was going into the
39:58
ministry. I mean Jesus was ministering before crowds. So there's a crowd control there's taking the offering
40:05
managing the finances organizing the events organizing the ministry like organizing like Jesus was going from
40:11
town to town. So Jesus and the disciples would have to stay at places like a home to stay in food like just like today. I
40:19
mean, it was a little more simple back then because we have to book flights and um for the events there's there's
40:26
lighting and cameras and audio. There's it's like more complex today, but it's
40:32
similar like everything that went into the work of God today, like that's how
40:37
it was back then, too. All the different logistics and everything. So, all of the disciples, they were assisting Jesus
40:44
with ministry constantly. So all of those like 12 disciples, God was using
40:50
them all. Now Judas was used just for a season by his own choice.
40:55
But before he made that decision to to betray Jesus, God was using him. Now for
41:01
him to betray Jesus me meant that he was not fully surrendered meant that he had an open door. But even though he had an
41:07
open door, God could still use him.
41:13
God can still use people if they're not totally surrendered. not to the capacity he will if they are fully surrendered
41:20
but sometimes that full surrender comes in a process like sometimes it it just
41:25
it's a process it's as you keep seeking God and keep finding him
41:32
your heart becomes ready to give give up everything
41:38
for Jesus so it's not like every single believer the moment that they first step to where
41:46
God's power is. It is not a formula where every person's the same. Every
41:51
person surrenders every part of their life that very first day that they come to where God's power is and they become
41:57
planted. It's different for everybody. It's different based on somebody's past, the amount of oppression they've had in
42:03
the past, the amount of trauma they've had in the past, the amount of purity, pure examples they've had in the past.
42:09
All these different factors go into it, but it it does not look the same for everybody. So my point is people may not
42:16
be fully surrendered to God, but God can still use them. God still wants them there. We we should not have this heart of like kicking people out and like
42:24
putting like like having this heart of judgment for others. Um just because they're not as
42:31
surrendered to God as you are, just because they're not as Christlike as you have become yet.
42:38
Because it is a process. We have to have grace for people. We have to have this
42:44
understanding that things take time and it's different for everybody. And you
42:49
know, you could be like judging Saul who became Paul. You could be judging him so much. You could be wishing ill for him.
42:56
You could be thinking like, man, he really should be killed because he's
43:02
taken so many lives and he's still on a hunt to take more lives, so his life should really be ended. Like you could
43:08
think that, but then we wouldn't have Apostle Paul. Look at the amount of grace that Jesus
43:14
had for Paul. This is the grace we must have for every
43:20
person. We must see people with this lens of grace and see people with hope, not judge them, not put a death sentence
43:27
on them, not put a um just a conclusion on them.
43:33
what when God's not done with them yet. When God isn't done with his process of transforming them yet.
43:46
So um you know
43:53
some people have different weaknesses. You can be so discerning of the angel of light, but maybe the devil really has
44:00
worked so hard in a person's life and they're deceived. Have grace for them. You know, have
44:07
grace for them. Don't immediately think,
44:12
you know, because this person is deceived, they're so dangerous for me. Um, if they're deceived in this area,
44:20
what you should do is not judge them. It says in the Bible, "Do not judge others and you will not be
44:26
judged." Matthew 7:1. Um,
44:31
if you see red flags about someone, um, I'll give you some examples. Actually,
44:37
I'm going to give you some examples about red flags. Here are some red flags
44:42
of people like that you were serving alongside going out of order.
44:50
um like disregarding teachings,
44:57
doing things their own way. Um acting like they're trying to have their
45:03
own ministry when it's out of order to be doing that. Like
45:10
acting in like this selfish ambition type way. um out of order when with like praying
45:17
for people like going against God's order in the new wine and just doing old
45:22
wine, doing their own thing, how they feel when it comes to praying for people.
45:27
Uh other red flags is someone harming you. Um another red flag is someone lying to
45:34
you. Another red flag is sinful behavior that doesn't match the image they
45:40
portray, like at church. So another red flag is manipulation.
45:49
So these are like red flags of those who are you you are serving alongside but
45:54
they are not red flags to dismiss to judge to excommunicate to
46:03
to stop loving and stop being you having a a heart of unity with.
46:09
These red flags are for you to know you're not supposed to bring this person in close as a close friend.
46:18
But you should not judge because many times we can be wrong with our judgments. Many times people can be
46:26
doing something wrong but it wasn't with ill intention. Maybe someone didn't hear
46:31
a teaching and you can be like why are they going out of order? Maybe they didn't hear a
46:36
teaching. Um there's so much new in the new wine. There's so much new new
46:42
principles of God. Or maybe the enemy really fought them when the teaching came. Maybe they
46:49
weren't listening to the teaching, not because they were being disrespectful
46:54
and prideful, but maybe the enemy really fought them with came in their mind when
47:00
they were listening to the message. Like there can be many different factors, different things that you cannot see that only God can see. And that's why a
47:07
person is behaving this way. So that's why it's so important you you don't especially the people that you're
47:13
serving alongside that you aren't quick to judge that you aren't quick to put a judgment on them. It's just if you're
47:20
seeing certain red flags that's just for you to be aware of to know I don't trust
47:25
this person. There's things about this person that are confusing their behavior. It's not matching up. But I
47:31
love this person. They are they are here in this revival army. They are a warrior
47:38
in God's revival army. So whether they are Peter, whether they are Judas, whether they are a different disciple,
47:45
I'm called to not judge them. I'm called to love them and stand in unity with them. Not in unity with all of their
47:52
actions. I don't mean that. But I mean like the fact that they are saying yes to God in his revival despite their
47:59
faults, despite their mistakes, despite immaturity, you are united with them. Um
48:08
so
48:13
yeah um
48:18
I want to I want to share that it is it is different you know when you are
48:23
serving alongside brothers and sisters in this
48:29
work of God you need to see it as work like as the workplace because that's
48:35
what church, the work of God, this kingdom work and his revival is it's the workplace. It's the father's business.
48:43
God is our boss and we are his servants and we work in the same place.
48:49
We have the same vision, the same assignment. We're called to work together as co-workers, co- lababorers
48:55
to bring in the harvest, to do this work of God. So, you know, when you h you
49:02
have friendships and then you go to the workplace and in your workplace maybe there's someone you're really close friends with and then there's others
49:08
that you're just acquaintances with and then there's others that you just don't get along with um that you don't have
49:15
any interest in spending any time with. And that's okay. You know, that's how you should see the the work of God as
49:24
the workplace like that. Like there's some people there that you are you are
49:30
called to to be close friends iron sharpen iron. This is a good pure thing
49:37
that God says yes to that God perhaps has ordained this friendship like David
49:44
and Jonathan. There are others that you are more like acquaintances with. You are not called
49:50
to bring them in close. Part of the reason is you just don't have the capacity to bring so many people in
49:55
close. But um that's okay. You you love them. You love them and you work
50:02
together in unity and love to do the work of God. And then there's
50:08
others where maybe they aren't fully surrendered.
50:13
Maybe um they're like a future Judas,
50:19
you know, or maybe they're Peter making mistakes and you're just not sure. So, you don't you don't quite trust this
50:25
person, so you don't bring them in close. That's fine. That's good. You know, you need to see your brothers and
50:34
sisters as collaborers. That's the most important way you see them.
50:40
Um that's very important because otherwise
50:45
let's say that that you start seeing so so Jud you know Judas
50:51
Judas betrayed Jesus and so but but but what's what's wild is that God ordained
50:59
Judas to be a disciple. Jesus called Judas. Like that wasn't a mistake. But like Judas had bad things in his heart
51:06
that Jesus wanted him to surrender and be transformed. But everyone has free will and Judas had free will to keep
51:13
that bad thing in his heart. But just because he started out with a bad thing in his heart didn't mean that Jesus
51:19
wasn't going to call him. Jesus did not call perfect people. He called flawed people and he invited them to surrender
51:28
everything to make their free will choice to surrender everything so he could transform them completely and take all the impurities out. But he didn't
51:35
start with perfect people because nobody's perfect. Even when you give your life to Jesus, you don't immediately become perfect. So as soon
51:41
as they started following Jesus, they didn't immediately become perfect. So here Judas is he's imperfect like the
51:46
rest. But Judas is not growing like the rest. Judas is is is choosing to keep
51:52
this impurity in his heart. But God still used Jesus. Judas Judas was in
51:58
charge of the finances like and and and and Jesus didn't excommunicate him. Jesus wasn't and Jesus didn't judge him.
52:05
Jesus wasn't like, "Hey disciples, um everyone put a big red flag on Judas.
52:13
Don't ever talk to him. Hopefully, he'll just leave because the way he's acting, he's going to
52:21
really cause so much harm to me and all of you. Jesus did not do that. Jesus had
52:26
grace. Jesus had patience. The time wasn't up until Jesus then says, "One of you will betray me." But that was that
52:32
night. Like up until the last moment, Jesus still had grace for Judas. He
52:37
didn't like say to everyone, "Everyone, Judas has a bad heart and he's going to
52:43
betray me." He didn't announce that like he had grace for him, you know. And so
52:50
you got to you got to have that grace and understanding about like how important the work of God is. No, not
52:57
everyone that's doing the work of God alongside you is going to be perfect. And everyone's in different seasons.
53:03
Everyone has different temptations. Everyone has different weaknesses. Um that's okay. You aren't called to bring
53:10
everyone in close. You aren't called to be best friends with everybody. You shouldn't be. You shouldn't. You
53:16
should only bring a few people in close. So there's other people that you're not sure about. That's fine. Just co- labor
53:22
with them. Be united in the labor that you do. It's work mode. It's about the father's business mode. And when that's
53:29
the case, you're protected. It's like that same principle I shared with you. Like when I'm ministering, if people
53:34
have demons, if people are lukewarm, that's not negatively affecting me because I'm in ministry mode. I'm not in
53:41
friendship mode. So when you are doing the work of God with fellow brothers and
53:46
sisters in Christ, you need to know this is not friends, friends in Christ,
53:51
friends in the Lord going and doing the work of God together. No, this is these are my co- lababorers and we are serious
53:58
about the father's business and we are doing the work of God together and we are united in this. We're not united in friendships. We're not united in best
54:05
friendships. We are not united in hanging out. We are united in doing the
54:11
work of God. Amen.
54:16
So, you know, at the workplace, maybe you're not close friends with everybody, but you have respect for all your co-workers. You have respect for them.
54:24
You treat them with kindness. You smile at them. You treat them with love. So, all of your brothers and sisters in
54:30
Christ that you collabor, this is how you should treat them. Just because you smile at them, just because you talk
54:36
kindly with them doesn't mean you're inviting them to be best friends. You don't need to be worried about that or
54:42
think that you're letting your guard down because you're being friendly to somebody that you know you're not called to bring close as a friend.
54:50
That brings me though to my next point that it's important that you really keep healthy boundaries
54:56
um when you're collaboring in the work of God.
55:02
you you can't run away from being firm to keep boundaries. This is
55:07
something you have to address. You have to confront if this is a weakness that you've had where um I have to do my Tik
55:15
Tok um verifying thing.
55:24
Here we go.
55:30
Hallelujah. um
55:36
boundaries. So, you know, you have to you have to uh be aware that there's
55:41
going to be some people that want to be close friends with you, but God may not be calling you to be close friends and
55:48
spend a lot of time hanging out, talking with this person. Um you have to be
55:54
prepared to stand firm and have boundaries. You can you can have boundaries with love and grace and
56:00
kindness. Don't be afraid. Don't feel like you're being um mean to somebody.
56:06
Saying no to where God is saying calling you to say no is saying yes to God. So
56:13
you really have to get that in you that putting up boundaries is obedience to God. Do not be afraid of being firm. You
56:20
should be gentle and kind and loving but firm. And and this is something you're going
56:27
to have to navigate um in in the revival army. You're going to have to navigate
56:32
keeping those boundaries. Keeping those boundaries like you are my co- lababorer. This is who you are. This is
56:38
how I see this person. This you know this isn't um I you're not just to be
56:43
swept by not you're not supposed to be just like swept by the wind of where anyone wants go do this, go do this, you
56:50
know, just go with what anybody says to do. Um, so yeah, you know, if that's a
56:57
weakness of yours, it's time to confront that and know that God has given you the strength and ability and grace to have
57:06
these boundaries and be and be firm when you need to be firm with love. Amen.
57:14
Hallelujah. I lastly want to say like um,
57:20
you know, I mentioned these red flags. I mentioned these red flags before of
57:25
like people that you shouldn't um bring in close, but when I say these red
57:32
flags, I I don't mean to that you should ever judge them. So, it's just an
57:37
indicator like, oh, I shouldn't bring this person in very close, but it doesn't mean that you need to stay away
57:43
from them, that you need to be afraid of them when collaboring together. Um, it's
57:50
just something to be aware of to not bring someone in super close. That's all. Leave it there. Leave it there. You
57:57
do not need to be afraid. You do not need to um be like like worried, you
58:03
know, if you see a red flag. Um, and
58:10
and and and I've shared this in the past. Some of you may might not have heard this, but if you are planted at Fivefold Church, and this just goes for
58:16
wherever you're planted, it is important to share with leadership if there is
58:22
something of concern that you do see um you know, something that is like harming
58:28
of another person or something that is a red flag that it could really potentially harm others. That is
58:34
important you share that information. So you have grace, but you also share
58:40
that for to to just just to do your job to make sure that the shepherd knows
58:47
what's going on so that the shepherd can take care of the sheep. Um, and sometimes that's even just just
58:54
counseling and teaching one who could be harming others and maybe that maybe
59:01
unknowingly, maybe they don't know, you know. Um,
59:07
and you also need to have grace for people and know that not everyone does things with ill intentions. You might see red flags, you might see wrong
59:14
behavior, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing it with ill intentions.
59:20
So, for example, if someone's going out of order, as I mentioned, um, it might
59:26
just be they've never seen that teaching. So, don't be quick to judge because some people go out of order with really wrong
59:33
intentions, with um wanting to do things out of selfish gain
59:39
and and with pride. But there's others that just don't know. They just don't
59:45
know about God's order yet. So, that's why you must you should not judge. Just
59:51
have this awareness that you don't know. You don't know their heart. So, do not
59:56
judge. Um also like manipulation is another one. Um there can be some people
1:00:03
that their personality is just taking charge. Um
1:00:09
and they may not realize that what they're doing comes across as manipulating. They may not realize that.
1:00:16
That might not because a lot of people that manipulate why this is such a big red flag is that they're doing it with
1:00:22
an evil intention. They're doing it with the intention of controlling a person and getting what they want. But other
1:00:28
people, they might just be like, "We need to get something done. We need to get this done." So they are like taking
1:00:35
charge type thing. And they have this natural inclination to um to step up and
1:00:42
get things done and you do this, you do this, you know, and they don't mean harm
1:00:48
by it. So that's just one little example. There's could be many other examples. Just I'm sharing this just so
1:00:54
you can have more grace for people and not quickly judge somebody that they
1:01:01
have bad intentions because of the actions you have seen.
1:01:08
At the same time, keep those boundaries up because that shows you you don't really know you can't be sure about
1:01:15
trusting this person to bring close. But keep that grace, keep that love, keep
1:01:20
that unity in your heart towards them. Amen.
1:01:26
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.
1:01:34
Hallelujah. And I want to lastly just encourage you to pray for
1:01:40
those those you you collabor with. If you see weaknesses, if you see ways the
1:01:46
enemy is attacking them, if you see ways the enemy is trying to blind them, pray for them. Love them. Be an example for
1:01:54
them. Shine your light. If they open up to you, you know, maybe
1:02:00
they're confused about something, have this heart to lead them into the truth.
1:02:05
Maybe share a teaching with them. You know, this teaching really blessed me.
1:02:10
You can just share that with them. there's ways that you can really help a person um when you're noticing that
1:02:18
there's a blindness, a blind spot that they have. So, you should have this
1:02:23
heart for a person rather than just trying to like protect yourself and be
1:02:29
thinking of yourself. Really see that they are your brother and sister. God has great plans for them
1:02:36
like he had plans for Peter, like he had great plans for Paul. And it's your job
1:02:41
to have the eyes of Christ towards them. Love them, pray for them, encourage them, shine your light before them so
1:02:48
God can use you to bring transformation and open up their eyes.
1:02:53
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Well, I am going to pray for
Prayer
1:02:59
all of you right now. So, the power of God is going to move through the screen right now. If you need healing, if you
1:03:05
need freedom, any kind of miracle, get ready to encounter Jesus right now.
1:03:11
Hallelujah. Just lift your hands right now to receive from God. And I encourage you to
1:03:17
just take a moment with Jesus and surrender to him and just to surrender
1:03:22
your relationships to him. Surrender if there's been areas of judgment and pride in your heart
1:03:29
to repent of that. And and I encourage you to just ask God to help you have
1:03:36
grace for others, love one another, have unity for one another, and to see people with his eyes.
1:03:43
Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
1:03:51
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. right now with any of these demonic soul
1:03:59
ties that have kept you in wrong relationships, that have kept you bound. Even some of you have wanted to break
1:04:06
free. You knew you're not supposed to be in this relationship, but spiritually you are bound by this demonic soul tie.
1:04:12
I I I I break this demonic soul tie off of you now in Jesus' name.
1:04:19
And I declare that all the manipulation, all the control that has come to you
1:04:26
through this relationship, through this person, it must leave your life now in
1:04:32
Jesus name. May this fear of man wanting to get
1:04:38
people's approval, may this go from you now in Jesus' name.
1:04:45
Be free of caring how people see you and think of you.
1:04:51
I speak every spirit of rejection must go now because I see that there's some of you
1:04:58
that have gone through a lot of rejection. So
1:05:05
you there's like fear that you'll be rejected in any way because it has
1:05:10
caused you so much pain that you have a fear of going through that again even if
1:05:16
it's in relationships that you don't want to have. I see some of you like if anyone shows
1:05:24
love to you, you latch on to it even though
1:05:31
you know this person's not good to have close in your life. But it's because you've gone through so
1:05:36
much rejection that you are just hungry for any kind of love. And it's
1:05:45
almost like a protective mechanism in case other people reject you, you'll have this love.
1:05:51
I declare right now that all of the trauma that has come from rejection
1:05:57
must leave you now in Jesus' name. All of this trauma that is cause you to
1:06:07
latch on to love anywhere to attention anywhere.
1:06:13
This trauma must go now in Jesus' name.
1:06:18
I declare all of the hurt that has come from rejection and all of the lies of
1:06:23
the devil that has spoken to you that you deserved this rejection.
1:06:29
This all must go now in Jesus' name. Every lie that is spoken against your
1:06:36
identity, it must go now in Jesus' name.
1:06:41
You are worthy of the most beautiful friendships and relationships. You are
1:06:48
worthy of this. God wants this for you.
1:06:55
You do not need to settle for less.
1:07:01
God wants pure pure friendships.
1:07:07
He wants you to be friends with those who are surrendered to God with
1:07:13
beautiful hearts that will love you well, that will love you selflessly,
1:07:19
that will sharpen you spiritually. This is what God wants for you. This is your portion.
1:07:25
And as you accept this, God releases it. You can't, you don't have capacity for
1:07:33
these beautiful relationships when you're holding on to the wrong relationships. There's no room.
1:07:41
I I declare any fear holding you back from
1:07:47
putting up boundaries, from ending wrong relationships, this fear must go now in
1:07:53
Jesus' name. And I speak all of this old wine judgment towards other people, being
1:08:00
quick to judge. This must go now in Jesus' name.
1:08:08
Thank you, Jesus. I declare right now that
1:08:13
every curse must be broken off your life. Every generational curse must be broken
1:08:20
in Jesus' name. this generational curse of broken relationships, of broken
1:08:25
families. I break this curse now in Jesus' name. I
1:08:31
break every curse of witchcraft, every curse of witchcraft that has kept
1:08:36
you in control by people. I break this curse now in Jesus name. And um if you
1:08:43
need deliverance, if you have sickness in your body's oppression, I encourage you to renounce right now, to renounce
1:08:51
these things. And Jesus is going to deliver you right now as you renounce.
1:08:58
Thank you, Lord. I detach you from all that you are renouncing now. And I declare that every
1:09:07
spirit of addiction must go, anxiety must go, depression must go. Every
1:09:14
spirit of rage, of lust, impure sexual spirits, all must go. Every spirit that
1:09:22
has come from abuse must go. Every spirit of insomnia must go. All
1:09:27
condemnation, spirit of religion must go. In Jesus' name,
1:09:33
I declare epilepsy must go. I see somebody being healed of seizures right now. God is touching you and healing you
1:09:40
now. I see God touching someone's ear right now. Be healed in Jesus' name. I see God
1:09:47
breathing in someone's lungs right now. You've had shortness of breath. I speak healing to your lungs now in Jesus'
1:09:54
name. I speak for every disease and every sickness. It must leave now. I see
1:10:00
some people with some chronic pain, tormenting pain in your body, constant pain. It's like 90% of the time you have
1:10:08
this pain. I declare this pain to leave you now in Jesus' name. And I see
1:10:14
somebody here right now that they have this cloud came over them like one day.
1:10:21
This cloud of darkness, this cloud of depression, this cloud of sadness, you haven't been able to shake it. You
1:10:27
haven't experienced joy and you don't know how long. I declare this spirit of
1:10:32
darkness, depression must go now in Jesus name. And may you be filled with
1:10:39
peace and joy now. Thank you Jesus. I see somebody tossing and turning in the
1:10:45
night having trouble sleeping. I declare insomnia to go and anything holding you back from sleeping well must go in
1:10:52
Jesus' name. Thank you Jesus. I see God touching someone's child. There's
1:10:57
someone whose child is sick. I see a fever. I see just just like
1:11:03
just stuffy and just that really sick. I speak healing now in Jesus' name. Thank
1:11:12

Thank you, Jesus. I see someone when every time they breathe it feels cold, like ice cold. Be healed right now in
1:11:27

Lift your hands if you haven't already. I release the miracles that you need in
1:12:03
your life. Breakthrough. May they take place now in Jesus name. I
1:12:08
release this anointing upon you. May the fire of the Holy Spirit come. Receive
1:12:14
the fire of God. receive his power in your life to be used by him mightily.
1:12:20
May more of his anointing come in you and move through you to touch many lives. May peace and joy fill your life
1:12:28
now. And may wisdom come upon you. May you walk in godly wisdom with navigating
1:12:35
every kind of relationship from the workplace, from the church, in the revival army,
1:12:45
everywhere in your life. May you walk in wisdom. Wisdom in all the different kind of boundaries you should put up, what
1:12:51
they look like, and that grace would cover you. Grace would flow out of you.
1:12:57
that anywhere you have to be firm that love and kindness and gentleness would
1:13:03
pour out of you in Jesus' name. And may you be filled with courage and boldness
1:13:08
and strength to do everything that God is calling you do to do to say no when God is calling
1:13:15
you to say no. May nothing hold you back from walking in God's will in every way
1:13:24
in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:13:31
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Give God a huge praise for what he has just done, for the miracles he has just done. Thank
1:13:38
you, Jesus. Hallelujah. I praise you, Lord. We praise you. I know that God has
1:13:43
done so many miracles right now. There are testimonies after testimonies all of the time, every day of miracles people
1:13:52
have received while watching these live streams. And many times these miracles,
1:13:57
you don't feel anything right away. You don't have any kind of manifestation. But these miracles have indeed taken
1:14:04
place because God's anointing is so real and it's so powerful. It's rare. And in
1:14:11
this revival, it's becoming less rare. Hallelujah. He's restoring it to all all
1:14:17
Christian leaders, all believers who will receive him. But I want you to know that just because you haven't seen the
1:14:25
power of God moving much doesn't mean that it's not here. It is here. It is
1:14:30
here. If you if this is your first time here, you don't know much about my ministry. Glory to God. He is moving in
1:14:36
power and doing so many miracles on every single live stream. I share all
1:14:42
this with you so that you do not leave on the table what God has just released
1:14:49
to you because I know with all my heart God has just released thousands maybe millions of miracles I believe for every
1:14:56
one of you watching you received a miracle it's different for everybody different for everybody maybe some of
1:15:02
you you don't need deliverance or healing but God did some other kind of miracle in your life he opened up a door
1:15:07
in the spiritual realm he released more joy to you he released more of his fire. He released more of his anointing for
1:15:13
you to be a vessel of him. He opened up your spiritual eyes and gave you wisdom through this message. But everybody, I
1:15:19
believe with all my heart that that every one of you have received something in the spirit. Some of you is
1:15:25
deliverance and healing. You've received something powerful and lifechanging.
1:15:32
So, it's so important. You know, everything in the kingdom comes by faith. And so, you know, God just
1:15:38
released thousands or maybe millions and who knows the amount of number the number because people were always
1:15:44
receiving on the replays. So, imagine how many people could watch this replay. So, maybe God released billions of
1:15:50
miracles on this replay. I mean, on this live stream to touch the people that will watch later. Hallelujah. And for
1:15:57
some of you, it's multiple miracles he's just released. But it's important you
1:16:03
value the anointing. value what he's released and receive it by faith. You receive it by simply, you know, faith is
1:16:10
is not about words, but I mean, it's not about um faith is about action. It's not
1:16:16
about a feeling. And so, this action of making the choice to believe that you
1:16:24
have received, that this anointing is real. That's what God counts as faith. And you can do that by speaking, by
1:16:30
speaking out. I believe I have received today. I believe I've received my miracle. I believed I'm healed. I believe I'm freed. I thank you, Jesus,
1:16:37
for healing me today, for freeing me today, for doing these miracles in my life today. I thank you, Jesus. And as
1:16:43
you do that, that's counted as faith. And that that makes the miracle to to stay with you
1:16:51
instead of being left on the table. But this miracle stays with you and you will see it manifest in your life.
1:16:57
Hallelujah. Praise God. So, I'm expectant for many miracles. I mean many testimonies of miracles. I I expect
1:17:06
these testimonies. I I expect to hear from you whether it's today, tomorrow, or maybe it's in the future this miracle
1:17:12
will manifest. But I am expectant and I encourage you to be expectant, too. So you receive all that God you keep all
1:17:18
that God has released. You receive and keep all that God has released today. Amen. Hallelujah. Hey, and I just want
1:17:26
to mention one more thing about my topic on boundaries because whenever I talk about boundaries, I really am talking in a general way, it's very nuanced and
1:17:33
different, different dynamics when it comes to marriage, when it comes to family that you live with. Okay? So,
1:17:38
when I'm talking about boundaries, I'm talking generally in the area of um
1:17:44
friendships and co-workers and people that you serve alongside. It's very
1:17:49
nuanced and different when it comes to marriage and people that you're forced to live with like they're your family.
1:17:55
Um, I have a lot of those teachings about this where I go more in depth on my YouTube playlist about relationships
1:18:01
that I talked about. So, go there. But I will just say generally real quick um is that uh let's say you're married or
1:18:10
you're living with someone, maybe it's a sibling and you're not 18 yet and you live with them, but they're they're
1:18:15
being used by the devil. there they have opened doors to the devil um because you were forced to live there you know
1:18:22
because um if it's you know God's will that you were staying in this in the
1:18:27
marriage for example um in this season for example you uh need to just really
1:18:35
go in the spirit you need to be diligent you need to be active in the spirit even more so than those who do not live in
1:18:43
that situation it's like God uses this. It's more of a of a of an everyday
1:18:49
battleground in the home, but God will use it for your good. He will use it as a refining fire. So, it's not to despise
1:18:56
it. It's just this in this season is your refining fire. This is your
1:19:02
training in the spiritual realm. So you need to be very diligent to renew your mind to reject the lies of the devil to
1:19:08
fill yourself with the word of God to guard your heart for ways the enemy can
1:19:14
speak through and do things through people that you are living with. You are protected by God's grace because in this
1:19:21
situation if that's the case you can't leave. It's different like if you're above 18 for example, you know, or
1:19:28
that's different. But when you know when you're like we'll say trapped in a
1:19:34
situation, God's grace is covering you. It's like Joseph was trapped in the pit.
1:19:39
Joseph was trapped in the prison, but God allowed that trapping. He allowed that as a refining fire and his grace
1:19:45
was over over him. So God's grace is over you to be protected as long as you
1:19:51
are very diligent to reject the devil's lies. Guard your heart, renew your mind,
1:19:56
fill yourself with God's word, and stay surrendered and obedient to God. Amen.
1:20:02
Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Well, I want to invite all of you right now to give to this work of God. To give to
1:20:08
this work of God at Fifold Church, where I am the the pastor. Um, I thank all of you for contributing to this work of God
1:20:15
continually because because you give this work of God can advance more. We have events that we are planning. We
1:20:21
have an event coming up in Brazil in January that we are hosting byfold church and it is possible because of
1:20:27
your contributions because of of your giving that we can put this event on. It
1:20:33
is fully hosted by 5F Church and that's how many of most of the events that I've ministered this past year have been.
1:20:39
They've been only possible because you give for us to be in in downtown LA uh
1:20:45
every Sunday. It's only possible because you give and only continues to be possible because of your generosity. We
1:20:52
have other events we are planning um as well Paris and New Zealand that many of you have contributed to. Thank you so
1:20:58
much for making these events possible so many more people can encounter Jesus in these different parts of the world.
1:21:04
Hallelujah. And so I want to encourage you to give to this work of God. So this work of God may expand so all the costs
1:21:12
are covered so that we can continue to do more and more works of God events all
1:21:18
that God is calling us to do to not stop short because there's not enough. I encourage you to have that heart of
1:21:23
abundance to have that heart of going at God's speed and reaching many people not
1:21:30
just some but more people. There's more work to be done. And as you give, God is
1:21:36
so faithful to pour back in into you more than what you've given. What you
1:21:42
sow, you reap. And so every time you sow, God pours out his spirit and
1:21:47
releases blessings. Releases miracles. Releases spiritual to financial miracles as blessings as you give. This is his
1:21:55
principle. We see in in Malachi, test me in this. Bring the tithe into the storehouse and see that I won't pour out so many blessings. There's no room for
1:22:01
for all of the blessings. He rewards when you give because giving to his work
1:22:07
is so special to him that he as a good father wants to reward. And so this is
1:22:12
actually one of the ways that we receive from God. You know, we don't give to God like a vending machine. Of course not.
1:22:17
We don't we don't buy anything from God. But in the spiritual realm, we should see giving as seed, as spiritual seed,
1:22:25
as something that is pleasing to God and as one of the ways that we receive from God. There are different ways that we
1:22:31
receive from God. different ways, but sewing is one of the ways, one of the
1:22:36
big ways we receive from God. He wants you to have that expectancy and know this is one of the ways I access
1:22:42
blessings, miracles that God wants to give me. Amen. So, I want to pray and
1:22:48
declare over all of you right now who are giving, if you can just lift your seat or your hands up right now. I send
1:22:54
this anointing upon your giving, upon your seeds now, and I declare there to be an increase of finances in your life
1:23:00
of provision. Let there be abundance in Jesus name. Let there be new doors that would open up to release the provision,
1:23:07
the blessings, the abundant life that you need in Jesus' name. May you be blessed more. May you be blessed more as
1:23:14
you bless God's heart, as you bless God's people, as you bless God's kingdom by contributing to the work of God in
1:23:22
Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you everyone for giving and for giving faithfully and continually giving. I
1:23:30
bless you. I have a couple announcements real quick. Um, first of all, I'm going to be ministering in Kansas City,

And that is at 12 pm. So, I'm so excited for how God will move through that as we
1:25:24
shine our lights in that place. I believe that God is going to move and
1:25:29
touch people. So, I'm so excited to see you all there. Um, and sign your books.
1:25:36
Cannot wait for that. So, that's that's taking place this weekend. Hallelujah.
1:25:42
And at 5F Church, we have services every single Sunday. This Sunday, we're going to be at the Aratani Theater at 12:00
1:25:49
p.m. Aritani Theater is right next to where ISUsa Street Revival broke out.
1:25:54
So, um, that's downtown LA. And I cannot wait for what God's going to do this Sunday. Do not miss it. If you're in the
1:26:01
LA area, we had people travel from eight nations this past Sunday. Eight nations.
1:26:07
Nine if you include America. Glory to God. And so many people travel from around the US, too. So,
1:26:15
this is really revival. I mean, this is truly revival.
1:26:21
I'm still in awe of what God did this past Sunday, the miracles he did, the testimonies he did, the way he moved.
1:26:27
So, if you're in the LA area, if you're not coming, you're missing out on revival. Do not miss out on this
1:26:33
revival, on this mighty move of God where people are traveling from eight nations on one Sunday to come and be a
1:26:40
part of and encounter Jesus. Hallelujah. So, I can't wait to see you there and all that God will do. If you can't make
1:26:46
it in person, join our 5F family online where God does so many miracles through
1:26:52
the screen as you watch. Um, also, we have an event coming up. Revival is now
1:26:58
S. Paulo, Brazil, January 9th. This is a free event, and I am so excited. There
1:27:04
is so much hunger in Brazil. I am so full of expectancy for what Jesus will do. This is going to
1:27:12
be such a powerful move of God. Link in my bio or 5Furch.org/events to register. It's free. So tell all of
1:27:19
your friends and family in S. Paulo and beyond. I know that people will be traveling from all over Brazil and South
1:27:25
America. I know. So, um I really encourage you to get there if you can. It's going to be lifechanging. Amen.
1:27:33
Praise God. Um,
1:27:38
also, um, we have small groups at 5Furch now. You can go to
1:27:44
5fchurch.org/smallgroups or the link in my bio to sign up for a small group. There are several small
1:27:49
groups all over the world. Um, many around the US and many in different
1:27:54
nations. And God is moving so powerfully in these small groups. And it is so powerful to unite together with your
1:28:00
brothers and sisters in Christ, fellow revival warriors in your nation, in your
1:28:06
state, in your city. As you do this, God is expanding revival through you more as
1:28:13
you unite together, as you come together, worship God together, receive from God together, share testimonies
1:28:18
together, spread revival together. Hallelujah. So, link in my bio or 5Furch.org/smallgroups
1:28:24
to join a small group. Um, also if you want to be planted at 5Furch,
1:28:31
um, you can go to 5fchurch.org/planted or the link in my bio. Um, also, oh, um,
1:28:40
my book, Unlock Your Deliverance. If you have not gotten it yet, I encourage you to get it if you need freedom or if you
1:28:45
need abundant life. This book, I believe, is for every person because I I there's so many people who have bondage
1:28:50
in some area and there's a lot most people are not walking in abundant life and the abundant life that God actually
1:28:56
intended them to have. And so, I reveal the keys to be free, completely free
1:29:02
from demonic oppression and to walk in abundant life in this book, Unlock Your Deliverance. Um, so many of you revival
1:29:11
warriors have gotten many of these books and given them to family, friends, co-workers, and given them to strangers
1:29:17
and place them places. I do that whenever I travel. I leave them in the airports
1:29:23
and I write free book on a five church flyer because I know that literally
1:29:28
probably 90 something% of people walking through the airports and everywhere
1:29:35
do not have total freedom. they have bondage in some area. And so this is
1:29:41
precious. This is valuable tool, a valuable tool to lead people to Jesus and what Jesus provides. So many
1:29:48
Christians do not know what Jesus provides. So I'm just I just thank Jesus for what he's done through this and for
1:29:54
this tool to reach people. Um you can get this book. I heard it's on sale for like9 something dollars on Amazon, I
1:30:00
think. Wow, that's awesome. So you can go to Amazon or anywhere books are sold
1:30:05
um to get this book. Um my first book as well is Secret of the Anointing. In this book, I teach you how to access the
1:30:13
power of God. How to be a vessel of God that whom God can entrust with his power. How to walk in miracles because
1:30:20
this is every believer's calling. These signs shall follow all who believe. They shall lay hands on the sick and be healed. They shall cast out demons is
1:30:26
what the Bible says. So you can find this book as well on Amazon or anywhere books are sold. and very exciting news
1:30:32

1:32:31
Um, and also, um,
1:32:39
I want to let you know all the other places we're going to meet for Sunday services. I know I mentioned this Sunday we're at Aratani Theater, but um ne the
1:32:46
next week we'll be at Aratani as well and then the next week we'll be at Basco Theater on the 19th and then the 26th
1:32:52
we'll be back at Aratani Theater. Um so yeah, hallelujah. Also lastly, um I want
1:33:01
to hold on
1:33:12
Okay, lastly, I want to let you know if you're new here, I want to let you know that there are scammers and
1:33:17
impersonators of me. So, please be aware of them. Please do not be scammed. This is how to not be scammed. Um, my main my
1:33:27
profiles on social media all have 200,000 followers or subscribers or
1:33:33
more. Many have way more. But that is the easiest, simplest way to know that
1:33:39
it's my account and not an impersonator. That's the easiest way. Very quick and
1:33:45
easy way. So there's a lot of different accounts of mine, not mine. Accounts
1:33:50
that have my picture and my name that are not me. All right? So look at the
1:33:55
follower count. Make sure you look at the real follower count, not written in the bio or something. Um, and that's the
1:34:02
quick way for you to know. I don't have any Facebook prayer request groups. You know how Facebook has groups? I don't
1:34:09
have even one group, just the page. All right, these groups have a lot of people
1:34:15
in them, a lot of posting. It's not done by me. It's not my group. Um, so you can
1:34:22
leave those groups. And um, also I never DM people. I never private message
1:34:27
people. I never private me message people about um uh uh like a prophetic message and
1:34:34
sharing that you should you need to sew a seed like sew a seed to an orphanage
1:34:39
um to be free of something the enemy is bringing or something. I do not do that.
1:34:44
That's what the scammers do. Okay. I also do not comment on your comments on my social media. These scammers do this
1:34:51
a lot where they pretend to be me and they comment on your comments and they'll say something like, "Message me
1:34:57
here. I want to talk to you more here, email me here," or something like that. That's not me. Also, I do not have a
1:35:04
Gmail, WhatsApp, or Telegram. The only way to contact my ministry is info@
1:35:10
5fchurch.org. That is the official email ministry uh contact. Um, also on
1:35:16
5fchurch.org organ apostle cric.com. There are booking a booking a way you can book me to speak at an event. Um,
1:35:24
hit that. That's the that's the only way to book me. Um, or going emailing
1:35:30
info5church.org. All right. Speaking of that, if you have a hunger for revival to come to your
1:35:36
city or your nation and you're interested in sponsoring an event such as a revival event, let us know. Email
1:35:42
us at info@5church.org. Um, but back to the scammers and the
1:35:47
impersonators. Um, I also will not video call you. Uh, so if you're getting a
1:35:54
video call from Apostle Catherine Crick, it's not me. It's a scammer. Um, and
1:36:01
what else? Oh, be aware of like AI voice. Um, like I will not um give you
1:36:08
an audio message. I will not send you an audio message. So, if you hear an audio message that sounds like me, it's not me
1:36:13
because I will not be sending you audio messages. All right. Uh, I think that's it. Um,
1:36:20
please block and report these fake accounts and um, let your friends and family know so they're not um, deceived
1:36:26
by the scammers. All right. Well, thank you, Jesus, for everything you
1:36:32
have done today. I'm so excited for what God's about to do in Kansas City, Missouri at this conference. I cannot
1:36:39
wait. I'm so excited. I'm so full of expectancy. So, I'm so excited to see all of you there who are going to come
1:36:45
in person. Um, and I'm also excited for the book signing and church this Sunday.
1:36:51
What an amazing few days we have up ahead full of revival. Hallelujah. So, I
1:36:58
will see you all at all of these things, I hope, or most of these. And um you
1:37:04
have a blessed rest of your night or day wherever you're watching in the world.
