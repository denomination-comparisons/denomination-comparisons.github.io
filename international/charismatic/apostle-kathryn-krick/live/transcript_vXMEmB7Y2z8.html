uh through 5F church and through Apostle Katherine. And um in 2023 we organized
55:05
the revival is now in Rotterdam. That was so amazing. And
55:10
for us like after that day nothing uh was the same. And um it also after that
55:17
we traveled with our family. We have four big sons. One is behind the camera,
55:24
one is behind the drums. Two are like smiling and worshiping along and and um
55:32
yeah at that time we didn't had um a church that we called our church. So we
55:38
after the event we traveled to LA and in private church uh LA we received the
55:46
anointing and importation of Apostle Apostle Katherine and um everything
55:51
changed for our family. Um we we we uh were wondering or we doubting like is
55:58
our are we doing good as parents for our kids? They don't go to Sunday school or
56:04
uh yeah, they don't have like a teenager club in the in in the church, but just
56:09
bringing them along and being uh a part of receiving that anointing um and
56:15
impartation that changed everything for them and for us in their lives. And it
56:20
was like a uh confirmation that uh what God is doing through Apostle Katherine
56:27
is is so powerful, is so good, it's so pure. And um we can only um testify of
56:36
that uh that that power and that uh lifech changing power. Uh there are so
56:44
many examples in our family of things that were not right. But after that
56:50
they are like they were so simple like um for example if one of our kids were
56:56
having difficulties breathing for asthma that they just write notes like I'm not
57:02
suffocating I'm free and believing in that and we went to Jakarta in Indonesia
57:08
and there was no difficulty of uh breathing. So
57:13
um yeah there are so so many examples of of um yeah that life-changing uh power
57:20
of God and um also we uh like how five F
57:26
church changed our lives is that we now are part of a small group. In fact, we
57:31
yeah, we have the privilege to yeah lead or like facilitate, however you want to call it. But yeah, being part of a group
57:38
of people via Zoom or like via uh face to face in person.
57:44
Um yeah, that's that's so so powerful. And uh each Sunday we just position
57:51
ourselves under the anointing by watching uh the teachings of Apostle
57:56
Katherine and also like having really divine encounters with with God like
58:02
through this teachings and also through the testimonies we give each other.
58:07
So yeah that's what 5F church means to us. Yeah, we are very proud of them, right? Because
58:14
because they uh yeah, they they organized this event with us and and all
58:20
Yeah. All the glory goes to Jesus of course, but we have such a great team uh
58:26

59:10

59:20
Hallelujah. Thank you. Hallelujah.
59:26
Hallelujah. Revival warriors in the Netherlands and
59:34
all through Europe and beyond. It's time to arise. Amen.
59:41
Are you ready to encounter Jesus, the God of miracles today?
59:47
Hallelujah. Jesus is coming in power to do miracles, to bring healing, to bring deliverance,
59:55
to bring breakthrough, to bring any kind of miracle you need today. He is coming
1:00:01
in power to set you on fire to pour out more of his spirit to release the
1:00:07
anointing impartation of anointing for you to be a powerful revival carrier. I
1:00:15
am so expectant and excited for what God is going to do today. I believe it will
1:00:22
be lifechanging for you. I believe it will transform the Netherlands and
1:00:28
Europe because of what God does here tonight. Amen.
1:00:34
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You can have a seat.
1:00:44
Thank you so much, Lisa and Wesley, for inviting me, for having me, for putting this amazing, powerful event on, and
1:00:52
fighting the good fight of FA. so that the people in the Netherlands, the people in Europe, all of you may receive
1:00:58
today. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
1:01:03
Thank you, Jesus. Well, God has brought revival
1:01:09
to this world. It is here.
1:01:14
We do not need to pray for revival anymore
1:01:19
because God has heard our prayers. He's answered them. And it is happening right
1:01:25
now. And what is taking place today is
1:01:31
revival. You are going, if you've never experienced revival, you're going to experience revival today.
1:01:38
If you've never encountered the power of God, you will encounter the power of God
1:01:44
today. And your life cannot be the same when you encounter the power of Jesus
1:01:51
Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Revival has come to this world
1:02:00
and God has been leaving me in awe and wonder as I've seen him move in ways
1:02:06
that have shocked me, that have blown my mind day after day, week after week, year after year.
1:02:13
And God's revival that he has brought to this world is greater and will be
1:02:20
greater than any revival that there has been because our God is a God who takes us
1:02:29
glory to glory and he's taking his bride to a new glory.
1:02:36
Now in this revival, God is restoring all that has been lost in the body of
1:02:43
Christ. All that we see in the Acts church when we read the book of Acts that we don't see today, God is
1:02:50
restoring it all. And that that is the key to seeing the
1:02:57
fruits of the axe church. That is the key of seeing the power of God and
1:03:02
miracles happen that happen in the Acts church is when we embrace God's ways
1:03:10
fully. We embrace God's ways of bringing equipping to the body of Christ which is
1:03:17
through the five-fold ministry according to Ephesians 4 11-16.
1:03:22
Apostles and prophets are the foundation of the body of Christ with Christ Jesus as the chief cornerstone. Ephesians
1:03:28
2:20. That's New Testament. And so if you do not have a foundation
1:03:34
at all, the house will not be very reliable. It will not stand very well.
1:03:41
There will be some issues. There will be some cracks and it won't be sturdy and powerful. Right.
1:03:47
Right. Amen. So that is this that has been the state of the body of Christ. By and large,
1:03:53
apostles and prophets have been forgotten, rejected, not embraced. But
1:03:58
that's the foundation. So now what we saw in the book of Acts, we saw the apostles starting out,
1:04:06
starting the churches, beginning the ministry, a solid foundation with the prophets that is being restored to the
1:04:14
body of Christ now. Hallelujah.
1:04:19
And as we embrace God's ways, God's ways of the five-fold ministry, bringing
1:04:24
equipping, bringing the power of God to the body of Christ, now we will see the
1:04:31
anointing moving. We will see miracles happen, demons leaving, the sick being healed,
1:04:38
impartation of anointing like Paul to Timothy. Hallelujah. And this is what is
1:04:44
happening now in revival. Revival is truly now.
1:04:51
Hallelujah. And God has been spreading this revival
1:04:56
all over the world, including in the Netherlands, including in Europe.
1:05:02
But this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning. God has
1:05:10
massive plans for a powerful revival in
1:05:16
the Netherlands and Europe. It's begun. But he has such massive
1:05:21
plans that would blow your mind. That will blow your mind.
1:05:27
God is truly bringing such transformation to the whole body of Christ. Not just one church, one
1:05:33
ministry, one denomination, not just to charismatics or those who uh pref like
1:05:40
the power of God. No, God is opening up eyes. He is opening up eyes around the whole
1:05:46
body of Christ to see that things there have been things that have been missing.
1:05:53
to see that much of the church does not have the kingdom of God because the
1:06:00
kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of
1:06:06
power. He is opening up eyes and as eyes open
1:06:13
up many will receive him. Many will receive his revival. Many will will
1:06:18
receive his power. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:06:24
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. And I have a message for those of you
1:06:32
that live in the Netherlands. How many of you here are from the Netherlands or live in the Netherlands?
1:06:41
Whoa. It looks like most. Raise your hand if you're not from the Netherlands.
1:06:48
Amazing. It's Wow. Hallelujah.
1:06:53
There's so many of you. Well, we are in the Netherlands. Of course, I know that makes sense, but I mean, when I
1:06:58
minister, I see just so many travel and there's so many of you that have traveled as well. But I'm just so, my
1:07:04
heart is so happy to see so many of you that live in the Netherlands here
1:07:11
because I have a special, very special prophetic word for you all that God has brought you here to receive. Hallelujah.
1:07:20
Hallelujah. The the Netherlands is the center in many ways
1:07:29
is is a is it it like in the Amsterdam airport it is one of the biggest in the
1:07:34
world is it is it is one of the main airports where people travel into from
1:07:41
all over the world. So it represents being a a kind of center in Europe, in
1:07:49
the world. And God has chosen the Netherlands
1:07:55
to be the center of revival in Europe.
1:08:02
Yes. Yes. Hallelujah.
1:08:09
You are chosen. You are chosen to carry this revival.
1:08:15
This revival will spread throughout Europe and many other places around the world from here from this nation.
1:08:25
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so God, as I say, has such
1:08:32
incredible plans that will blow your mind, that will shock you, that will
1:08:38
leave you in awe and wonder. his plans for a big revival in the Netherlands.
1:08:49
And there have been signs of this. There have been signs of of the Netherlands
1:08:54
being a chosen nation to carry this revival.
1:09:00
I'll never forget a couple years ago when the last time I I ministered in the Netherlands at AOY,
1:09:07
this was the most hunger I had seen in Europe thus far
1:09:13
by like double the hunger I saw that day.
1:09:19
Even since that day, there was a shift of spiritual warfare
1:09:26
that I encountered in my ministry from that day because the devil was so
1:09:32
terrified of the hunger of you people.
1:09:41
the acceptance of the Lord that you have
1:09:49
because the devil just as in the times of Jesus he works
1:09:54
very hard to try to hold back revival because the anointing destroys the yoke.
1:10:03
Without the anointing demons stay in people. That is why There are so many believers
1:10:11
that are oppressed with anxiety, depression, addiction, many sicknesses,
1:10:20
rage, lust, problems in marriage etc. Sleeping
1:10:25
problems etc. The reason why The reason why is because
1:10:32
those believers have not encountered the anointing because the anointing is rare
1:10:38
today. The anointing is what God is restoring in his revival and it is here
1:10:44
today to set you free. Hallelujah. If any of you need freedom,
1:10:51
the anointing, which is the power of God that moves through vessels, is here to destroy every single yoke in this place
1:10:59
in every person here and watching live. Yes. Hallelujah.
1:11:05
Hallelujah. And so the devil is not too afraid of,
1:11:12
he's not afraid at all of believers who do not carry the power of God, of churches, of ministries who do not
1:11:19
embrace the power of God, who do not demonstrate the power of God, he's not very afraid.
1:11:26
But when the anointing is in a ministry, this is what terrifies him more than
1:11:31
anything because it's the anointing that destroys the devil's works.
1:11:38
not just hinders the devil's works, destroys the devil's works,
1:11:47
breaks the chains, evicts demons.
1:11:54
Hallelujah. That's why Paul says, "I didn't come to you with wise and persuasive words, but
1:12:01
I came to you with a demonstration of the power of God
1:12:07
so that your faith would not rest on man's persuasive words, but on the power
1:12:12
of God." Hallelujah.
1:12:17
So the devil just in the times of Jesus, he works so hard today
1:12:24
through Pharisees of today with the religious spirit in old wine trying to
1:12:32
hold back the revival. He tries so hard.
1:12:39
He's at work day and night. This is what he is the most serious about is trying to stop the work of God, trying to stop
1:12:47
revival. But as long as there are people, vessels of God, servants of God,
1:12:55
that will stand firm against the devil's schemes, the devil cannot do a thing.
1:13:01
The devil cannot hold back. Revival cannot stop the work of God. Hallelujah.
1:13:10
Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you Jesus. Thank you
1:13:16
Jesus.
1:13:21
Hallelujah. So this revival
1:13:28
has grown and grown and grown ever since God released it to
1:13:35
this earth. I hear the anointing touching somebody
1:13:40
over there. Praise God. That's how powerful the anointing is.
1:13:46
Can someone help her come to the front? This person. Praise God.
1:13:53
Thank you, Jesus.
1:13:58
When I was in my mid20s, I was pursuing be pursuing Christian music. I thought I
1:14:06
had found my calling finally on this earth. After searching long and hard, I
1:14:11
was so excited. I finally found what I was put on this earth to do. And I'm excited about it. I'm passionate about
1:14:18
this dream. But then the same year that I surrendered everything to Jesus after
1:14:23
my eyes opened up to how near he was, how real he was, and his power and his
1:14:29
love like never before. I went to a conference. And at that conference, my now spiritual father, his name is
1:14:35
Prophet George Davi, was ministering. And I saw God move in power like I had
1:14:40
never seen as he ministered. He then shortly after prophesied to me
1:14:46
that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and I was called to reach the nations. I didn't want to be a
1:14:52
minister. I was like Moses and I thought of Moses in that moment because public speaking was my biggest fear and
1:14:57
weakness. But I had this knowing this is a true prophet and this is God speaking
1:15:05
and I must humbly obey. I must be in God's will. Even if I don't
1:15:14
understand it, even if I don't want it, I must be in God's will. That's how I felt in my heart. And so I accept that
1:15:22
calling for my life that day. And nine months later, I started
1:15:28
Five-fold Church. We started as a worship night on a mountaintop. Months
1:15:35
after that, Prophet Jordan, my spiritual father, the same one that prophesied my calling, he came to America. I hosted
1:15:41
him at a conference. And he said that God sent him for one reason to come to
1:15:47
LA at this conference and that was that God had heard the people's prayers for
1:15:52
many years and he is answering them now. He is answering us now. Revival is now.
1:16:02
It is no longer time to pray for revival. Revival is now. Hallelujah.
1:16:09
Thank you, Jesus. I break every word curse off of him now in Jesus name. I break every generational curse and I
1:16:15
declare every spirit tormenting him in the mind. Every spirit of darkness all
1:16:22
must go now in Jesus name. I speak peace
1:16:28
to his mind. I speak total healing in Jesus name. May his mind function
1:16:35
well from now. Thank you Jesus. Praise God. From today there will be a great
1:16:42
transformation in his mind. He is healed by Jesus stripes. Hallelujah.
1:16:48
Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. So he prophesied that revival is now.
1:16:54
And I knew that this was a true word of God. And I knew I must uphold this word.
1:17:00
I kept speaking from that day. Revival is now. And year after year for four and
1:17:06
a half years, our church got smaller from 20 to 15 to 10 to five down to two
1:17:12
during COVID times. And during COVID times, we couldn't rent our building anymore. So, we moved outside and had
1:17:19
church in the park. As Jesus said, I'm taking my church out outside of the box.
1:17:25
Go outside. Hallelujah. And it was in that park when we came
1:17:32
down to two people. Sometimes one person would show up during the service. Sometimes it was in that park that
1:17:40
revival broke out. A video went viral. This video God started God moved in
1:17:46
power and many miracles happened through this video that I put out. And from there people started flocking in at
1:17:53
flocking into the park, our our church service at the park. Then the first demon that I'd ever cast
1:17:59
out by God's power, it happened at that church at at the church outside at the
1:18:05
park. Hallelujah. And that deliverance went viral.
1:18:10
And so many people started coming in, started traveling, started flying from
1:18:17
all over the country, then all over the world within a couple months. And revival broke out beyond my wildest
1:18:24
dreams. We grew from a handful to 20 in a couple months, from 20 to 300 in two
1:18:31
months. And it be immediately became this global revival where people were receiving
1:18:38
through the screen every single service. And since that summer, 2021, we're now
1:18:46
so now four years later, people have traveled from around the world. Many of them are you here, some of them are you
1:18:52
here. They've traveled around the world to come to our services at in LA at 5F
1:18:57
Church every single Sunday since that since that year. Glory to God.
1:19:08
Now, those four and a half years
1:19:14
were hard. They were not fun. those four and a half years before revival broke out.
1:19:21
It was in the first year that I experienced the first kind of spiritual attacks like you see in the Bible.
1:19:29
Spiritual attacks where evil comes towards you through people that
1:19:35
you can't imagine like Jesus he was hated without cause
1:19:40
the Bible says. So I started experiencing that just in the first year. people hating me without cause,
1:19:46
rejection, lies made up just that first year. And when I started experiencing
1:19:51
that kind of hatred, jealousy, evil for the first time in my life, this was
1:19:57
confirmation to me. The this prophecy, these prophecies about revival,
1:20:04
this anointing that I carry is real and the devil is terrified.
1:20:12
Hallelujah.
1:20:18
God allowed this what felt like going backwards just like Joseph must have felt like he was going backwards when he
1:20:24
was thrown in the pit when he was sold to slavery when he was thrown in the prison.
1:20:29
God allowed that feeling like going backwards further away from the promise instead of
1:20:36
towards. He allowed it for my good as a refining fire.
1:20:44
Because every time you choose to obey God, when it's difficult, when it's
1:20:50
uncomfortable, when it's hard, every time God changes you through that,
1:20:59
he molds your heart to become more like him. Every time. There's no obedience
1:21:07
that is wasted. And the harder it is to obey, like the more uh you know
1:21:13
uncomfortable it is to obey God, the more transformation takes place. That's
1:21:19
why it's called the refining fire. If you want to look like gold, shiny
1:21:25
like gold, beautiful, you have to go through fire.
1:21:30
Not just pass by a heat lamp. not just get a suntan.
1:21:38
You gotta go through the fire if you want to be changed to be more like
1:21:44
Jesus. And that's that's one of the big reasons why it says in Romans 5:3, "And not only
1:21:53
this, but with joy, let us exalt in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships,
1:21:59
knowing that hardship, distress, pressure, trouble, produces patient endurance, and endurance, proven
1:22:05
character, spiritual maturity, and proven character, hope, and confident assurance. Such hope in God's promises
1:22:13
never disappoints us because God's love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who
1:22:20
is given to us. So I transformed so much through that
1:22:25
time. I indeed was like a new person at the end of those four and a half years. And I had to be a new person because I
1:22:33
didn't see myself as an apostle at first. I did not see myself as someone that people would look look to for
1:22:40
spiritual wisdom. And I didn't see myself as I couldn't picture myself carrying anointing and casting out
1:22:46
demons and healing the sick. I couldn't picture myself leading many people. I couldn't picture myself being a pastor.
1:22:53
I could not see it. So God had to transform me. He had to take me through
1:22:59
the fire so that I could be molded in who he had called me to be.
1:23:07
You don't just go from Abram to Abraham overnight. You have to leave behind what's
1:23:13
comfortable and you have to go to a new land. You have to go on a journey. You have to go
1:23:19
through that wilderness to get to that new land where you will be Abraham.
1:23:24
Hallelujah. And so once the promises were fulfilled, revival started breaking out. I was
1:23:32
ready. God had to make sure I was ready to handle the weight of the anointing,
1:23:39
the responsibility of the anointing of being a spiritual leader for many people. God had to make sure I was ready
1:23:46
to handle the great weight of persecution. God had to make sure that I
1:23:52
was ready to be so selfless, love my enemies, not care what people
1:23:58
think about me, but only be after God's heart when the persecution came.
1:24:07
When the persecution came, by God's grace, I didn't fall. I stood. I stood
1:24:15
firm. I kept walking. I kept preaching. I kept doing the work of God with a smile on my face. Glory to God.
1:24:23
I turned my cheek. I didn't let the devil tempt me to speak against my
1:24:28
enemies. I didn't let the devil tempt me to get depressed and upset by all this unjust
1:24:35
persecution coming at me. But that is thanks to God's perfect ways of taking
1:24:42
me through the refining fire that at the time I did not understand.
1:24:48
year. I was like, I really hope this is the year the promise comes to pass.
1:24:55
I didn't get it back then. Now, now if I could do it all over again, knowing
1:25:01
everything, knowing everything, I would be like, "Take your time, Lord. You sure know
1:25:08
what you're doing. I need all the preparation I can get for what's to come. I'm not rushing you at
1:25:14
all, Lord. Hallelujah.
1:25:21
His ways are perfect. His ways are higher than ours. Meaning, we don't understand. They're too high. They're
1:25:27
too spiritual where they're too for our for our natural mind. It's it's it's
1:25:32
difficult at times in the moment to perceive his perfect ways. That we have
1:25:38
to just trust him. let go of what we want, of what we think is best, and
1:25:45
simply trust him like a child. He knows best.
1:25:50
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So once revival broke out, entered the
1:25:58
promised land. But then I started experiencing what Joshua and the Israelites experienced when they when
1:26:03
they entered the promised land. They didn't just enter the promised land and sip virgin pinina coladas on the beach
1:26:10
and lay in hammocks. No, they they were at constant in
1:26:16
constant battle. God had given them all this land, but they had to go stand up to the enemies
1:26:23
and conquer them. It didn't just come easily. God gave
1:26:29
them the land, but they had to fight the good fight of faith.
1:26:36
And when they stood strong as revival warriors,
1:26:41
God was with them. And God gave them victory every time. And then they had that land. They they conquered this land
1:26:47
here. They conquered this land over here, this land over here. But they had to work for it. They had to fight for
1:26:53
it. They had to do the work of God.
1:26:59
and look at the face of the enemy and and and speak to the devil. Get out of
1:27:05
my way. This is my land. God has given me.
1:27:12
Hallelujah. Praise God. So these battles, this was
1:27:17
like a a a greater persecution than I could have ever imagined. The I mean greater attacks of the enemy that I
1:27:22
started facing. I never imagined the Bible could come alive like this. like
1:27:28
like how the Pharisees attacked Jesus, these false accusations, saying he's using demonic powers to cast out demons,
1:27:35
saying that he's false, saying that he's going against the word of God, saying
1:27:41
that he's a heretic. These these all of these things they were saying towards Jesus, I started
1:27:47
experiencing these words coming at me, these attacks coming at me through people.
1:27:53
And the Bible says that we will be persecuted like Jesus was. We will be hated like he was.
1:28:00
But it shocked me. It shocked me to actually experience it. To actually
1:28:05
experience people being used by the devil like this.
1:28:12
I saw the devil try to intimidate me like Goliath looking at me. I saw the
1:28:19
devil try to intimidate me like, "Who do you think you are?
1:28:24
You can't make it. You can't go into this new territory that God's calling you to."
1:28:31
I I s I saw the devil try to intimidate me like this. But by the grace of God,
1:28:38
by the by the equipping and guidance of my spiritual father as well,
1:28:44
I was able to not doubt my God, but keep
1:28:50
believing that he is faithful to his word. His promises are yes and
1:28:58
amen. And that he will overcome every giant in
1:29:03
my way. every giant in the way of revival
1:29:09
spreading. I continue to believe our God
1:29:16
that he is all powerful, way more powerful than the devil.
1:29:22
You know, the devil is just a facade. He's just he just tries to intimidate. It's like Goliath verse David. It looks
1:29:30
like there's no way David could win this fight. But If you see in the spiritual
1:29:35
realm, how tiny is Goliath compared to God, the creator
1:29:43
of the universe? And and and and God was with David. It wasn't David fighting
1:29:49
Goliath. It was God through David.
1:29:54
The battle was Goliath verse God.
1:29:59
It's it's this is how it is for us. This is how it is for us as warriors of God's
1:30:07
revival army. If he if God is for us, who can be
1:30:14
against us? Who? Who? Meaning that's silly.
1:30:20
Goliath compared to God. That's silly. Who can be against us?
1:30:28
But you have to go in the spirit. You have to see in the spirit or you'll think the opposite.
1:30:36
You'll think Goliath for sure will win. He's too big. He's too powerful. You
1:30:41
have to go in the spirit. You have to renew your mind. You have to choose to
1:30:47
believe how great, how powerful, how mighty, how
1:30:52
faithful our God is. Not just in general, but in your
1:30:58
personal life. And not just in your personal life, but in God's move, God's true move, God's
1:31:07
revival. You need to remember just how powerful he is in his revival army moving through
1:31:16
them. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:31:22
I have seen um persecution come my way that I couldn't even dream or imagine
1:31:29
year after year after year. Especially beginning once revival broke out. Once revival broke out, I could see when I
1:31:36
saw this persecution, I saw just how terrified the devil was of the power of
1:31:43
God and of revival. It opened my eyes to see just how terrified the devil was by
1:31:48
seeing the spiritual warfare that came my way. And it hurt. Persecution hurts.
1:31:54
Persecution is not fun. It hurt.
1:31:59
But I chose to put my eyes on Jesus. And he gave me peace. He gave me peace through every trial,
1:32:08
through every storm. Yes. Thank you, Jesus. through every
1:32:13
kind of persecution that came my way. I can tell you honestly, I never had
1:32:19
depression through any kind of persecution that came my way. I never spent longer than, I don't know,
1:32:28
a few minutes crying. Even when I've experienced such evil, it
1:32:34
feels like I'm looking at the devil himself. The evil so intense. I never cried more than a few minutes at
1:32:41
one time. I think so. Glory to God. Through all of that persecution I've
1:32:48
experienced year after year, the work of God never stopped.
1:32:54
I was never too sad or too weak to continue with the work of God.
1:33:00
I was never sad too sad that I had to stay in bed all day or something like that.
1:33:07
When I look back at the persecution I have gone through, I would go through it again and again and again. It was so
1:33:14
worth it because God only allows
1:33:19
attacks from the devil when he's intends to use it for your good.
1:33:24
When he intends to use it as yet another refining fire because the greater the calling, the greater the cost.
1:33:33
The greater the cost. Number one, because it's so valuable and powerful what you carry, but also the greater the
1:33:42
cost because it's like if you want to be a doctor, you got to go to way more years of school than other professions.
1:33:49
Right. Right. So, it's the greater the cost of
1:33:54
preparation. It's more trials you're going to have to go through. It's more types of it's a
1:34:02
higher level persecution that will come your way that God will allow to refine you.
1:34:07
Anybody here want a big calling? You should.
1:34:13
You should want to be so effective for Jesus. You should want to bring many souls into the kingdom and lead them to
1:34:20
Jesus. Not just a handful, many. You should want a big calling.
1:34:27
But the Bible says you got to count the cost. If anyone wants to be my disciple, you must leave everything. Pick up your
1:34:33
cross and follow me. Jesus says, and then he says, you have to count the cost.
1:34:40
And so, I'm telling you today, there's a cost and I've paid a lot of it. And I know I'm going to continue to pay it
1:34:46
because I'm young still. We got a lot of work to do for God. And God wants to for my life, for his glory, for revival. He
1:34:52
He wants to take me to new heights for his glory. Glory to God. So, I know I'm not done paying the cost.
1:34:59
But I paid I paid a cost to get here. And I want to tell you that it's worth
1:35:05
it. It is so worth it.
1:35:10
It is so worth it to be used by God in power to be used by God to lead people
1:35:19
to Jesus. to to be used by God to deliver people from demons and heal
1:35:26
people and release impartation of anointing upon people. There's no greater joy.
1:35:33
There's no greater joy than touching the father's heart and doing what you were called to do on this earth. There's no
1:35:39
greater joy than seeing people encounter the love of Jesus. There is no greater
1:35:45
joy. And so because of that, the cost is
1:35:51
definitely definitely worth it.
1:35:58
So worth it that we should have joy paying the cost. Just as in the verse I just read, that
1:36:05
we should have joy in hardships because it's worth it.
1:36:14
Because that refining fire, that persecution that you go through, it's translating
1:36:22
to more souls saved because God can use you now. It's
1:36:28
translating to more people being delivered and healed and encountering God's love.
1:36:36
And that's how God wants you to see persecution. And that's how God wants you to see spiritual warfare that comes
1:36:41
your way when you are a revival warrior.
1:36:47
The Bible says what the devil meant for evil, God intended for good.
1:36:59
So whenever persecution, attacks come your way,
1:37:04
God's intending it for good.
1:37:11
It's like the devil when he used these Pharisees
1:37:17
to to get Jesus crucified. This was the ultimate God using it for
1:37:24
good. Because on the cross, the blood of Jesus
1:37:30
was shed to to to save us from a lifetime of hell, to wipe away our sins,
1:37:38
to destroy the curse of the devil, and to bring us abundant life, healing, and freedom.
1:37:45
Hallelujah. But you can live in those times. You can
1:37:51
be confused like the disciples were. They're confused. there. Jes Judas Judas
1:37:57
betrayed Jesus. Peter denied Jesus three times. They're running away in the moment. They don't know what's going on.
1:38:04
How come God isn't intervening? God knew what he was doing.
1:38:09
But the devil intended for evil. God intended for good.
1:38:15
For good. For billions of people. For you and me today. God intended that for
1:38:20
good. that persecution of Jesus for good.
1:38:26
Amen. Hallelujah.
1:38:35
Romans 8:37. No, despite all these things,
1:38:41
overwhelming victory is ours through Christ who loved us.
1:38:48
overwhelming victory is ours.
1:38:55
I am a different person today than a couple years ago when I last saw many of
1:39:00
you. I am a different person today than I was four years ago, four and a half years
1:39:07
ago before this revival broke out. One of the big ways I am so different is
1:39:12
my faith has grown massively.
1:39:19
Because at first when you step up to Goliath, it's scary. It's scary. At first when you when you
1:39:27
are you're you come to the sea and Pharaoh and his army is is running
1:39:33
towards you is scary. But when you take the the rock and the
1:39:40
slingshot and it kills the giant
1:39:45
because God is with you, his power is with you.
1:39:52
When you lift your staff and the sea splits because God is with you and you are
1:39:59
given overwhelming victory through God, your faith will grow massively.
1:40:07
Hallelujah. And that is what has happened to me.
1:40:14
I can't tell you the number of times that I had those moments of facing
1:40:21
Goliath, of Pharaoh and his army coming at me, new levels of evil, new, you know,
1:40:27
there's a saying, new levels, new devils. Again and again and again I saw the devil come
1:40:35
in new schemes in a higher level of evil through people always through Pharisees
1:40:41
of today. But every time glory to God I've seen God bring me
1:40:48
bring his revival bring his move bring my ministry 5F church overwhelming
1:40:53
victory every time.
1:41:00
Glory to God. Hallelujah. You excited with me? I'm excited about
1:41:06
my Jesus. I'm excited about my champion, our
1:41:12
champion who is undefeated. Hallelujah.
1:41:17
Every time. I can't even tell you how many times. I can't tell you. It's so too too many to count. the ways the
1:41:24
devil tried to stop me, tried to stop the move of God, tried to at least hold it back, I can't tell you the amount of
1:41:31
times, but every time the devil has been defeated.
1:41:37
And not just has he been defeated, but God has made his revival to grow. Every
1:41:43
single time after every attack, he has made his revival to grow. More people have come
1:41:50
into the kingdom. More people have been set free of demons. More people have been healed of sicknesses. More people
1:41:56
have received impartation of anointing and are being used mightily by God. Glory to God.
1:42:04
At the church I pastor, Fifold Church, we have people planted, meaning it's they're members of our church
1:42:11
from 100 165 nations so far. Only Jesus. Only Jesus.
1:42:21
only God. Hallelujah. And so the devil's plan backfired.
1:42:26
That's another reason why we rejoice in our hardships
1:42:32
because the devil's attacks, persecution is a catalyst
1:42:39
to lift you for God's glory.
1:42:45
Like one thing I've seen is a lot of people, some some of them are you out
1:42:51
here. A lot of people that um are a part of my church, they're members of my
1:42:56
church from around the world. A lot of them have witnessed persecution that I've gone through. A lot of them have
1:43:02
seen it. They've seen it. Not just one, they've seen a lot. They've seen videos.
1:43:07
They've seen all sorts of things. But they've seen how God has been faithful
1:43:13
to bring victory and and and fight my battles for me.
1:43:21
They've seen the faithfulness of God and they've seen glory to God. They've seen
1:43:26
that it's possible to love your enemies. They've seen that it's possible to have peace and joy in the storm
1:43:35
and keep doing the work of God through the storm with a smile on your face with
1:43:41
fire in your heart still for Jesus and his people.
1:43:47
And so many of them some many of them are you like they've testified to me
1:43:52
they've told me how their faith has grown so much how they they h they
1:43:57
didn't know that it was possible to love enemies like this but now they know it's possible and now they want to be like
1:44:04
that too. They want to love their enemies too. And so I have seen I literally have seen
1:44:11
through so many testimonies and just seeing it in their lives. I've seen
1:44:18
so many people be strengthened, become more powerful in Christ, become
1:44:25
more Christlike, have a bigger faith because they've watched like the Bible
1:44:32
come alive. They've watched a David verse Goliath battle like through my
1:44:38
life for example and seen how powerful our God is
1:44:44
that he brought victory. They saw a present day coming up to the sea and
1:44:49
Pharaoh and his armies chasing him and God split the sea. They see it
1:44:56
present day today. They seen a modernday Saul chasing
1:45:01
David, but Saul never being successful and God bring God bringing David
1:45:08
victory. Hallelujah. So, I've seen what the devil intended
1:45:14
for evil, God used for good, for the Bible to come alive.
1:45:21
the Bible, you know, for for for people to be strengthened in faith, for people
1:45:26
to be transformed more into the image of God, we need to see the Bible come alive in every way. Not just the the promised
1:45:33
land days, but the valley days, the being thrown in a pit days, the being
1:45:40
hunted by Saul days, the coming up against the sea with the army behind you days, and facing Goliath
1:45:48
days. Amen. those stories in the Bible where you see
1:45:54
the the servants of God going through hard things, the devil trying to stop them, but God coming through and
1:46:00
bringing them overwhelming victory every time. That is what brings you faith.
1:46:06
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God is good. Amen.
1:46:13
Thank you, Jesus.
1:46:19
The devil tried to stop David, but he was unsuccessful.
1:46:24
The devil tried to stop Joseph from being who he was called to be. He
1:46:29
was unsuccessful. The devil tried to stop Moses. He lost again. The devil tried to stop Jesus
1:46:38
from fulfilling his calling on this earth, his assignment, and he lost again.
1:46:44
The devil tried to stop the first disciples and the first five-fold ministers and
1:46:50
the devil was unsuccessful again
1:46:57
because our God never changes. Our God is all powerful and our God is a
1:47:04
champion that brings victory every single time.
1:47:10
I see that same God who who brought victory for all of his
1:47:16
servants in the Bible. I see that same God alive today in my life in this
1:47:23
revival. Hallelujah.
1:47:30
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. So
1:47:36
the only way the devil wins is if you let him. Is if you let him by giving
1:47:44
into his lies, by giving into intimidation. David had the choice to give into the
1:47:50
intimidation of Goliath and and say, "Never mind. I I I don't know what I was
1:47:56
thinking when I said I'll fight him. Never mind. Retreat." He could have retreated, but he didn't.
1:48:02
He chose to see in the spirit and believe his God, our God, that God was
1:48:10
with him, that God had sent him to do this, and that God would be with him,
1:48:16
would fight this giant for him.
1:48:22
And that's how the devil was defeated. But David had that choice. All of those
1:48:28
servants of God that I just mentioned, Joseph, Moses,
1:48:34
Jesus, the disciples, they all had the choice
1:48:40
to give into the devil's lies when he came intimidating them because
1:48:45
he was terrified of the calling on their life and the anointing and revival they carry.
1:48:51
Or standing firm. They chose to stand firm and believe
1:48:57
God and obey God with everything in them. And that is how they access the
1:49:04
overwhelming victory of God. It's the same today.
1:49:12
God will give you in your personal life and in this revival. In this revival in
1:49:18
the Netherlands, in this revival in Europe, God will give you overwhelming
1:49:24
victory every time.
1:49:30
Not not just not just victory, not just winning by a hair. Oh, it was close.
1:49:38
Overwhelming.
1:49:43
That means you don't get to you don't have to get all worked up and stress stressed out when you have to step up to
1:49:49
battle when the devil comes with persecution. Nope. You are guaranteed by God
1:49:56
overwhelming victory. So that means you can rest.
1:50:01
That means you can step up to Goliath with confidence. I'll fight him.
1:50:07
with confidence, with peace. That's how you can That's how I approach
1:50:14
my battles these days. A lot more peaceful, a lot more restful because my eyes have opened up at how mighty our
1:50:21
God is and how faithful our God is and how tiny the devil is. He's just a liar.
1:50:29
He's just talk. He's just talk.
1:50:36
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible, it says
1:50:47
Ephesians 6:10, a final word, be strong in the Lord and
1:50:52
in his mighty power. Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand
1:50:58
firm against all strategies of the devil. This is a word for you in the
1:51:04
Netherlands and in Europe and wherever you came from.
1:51:10
You God is calling you to stand firm. God is calling you to be strong.
1:51:16
Be strong and courageous in the face of the devil who is terrified of the
1:51:22
calling on this nation to carry revival to all of Europe and beyond.
1:51:29
Stand firm. He's got nothing on our God.
1:51:35
Stand firm. Put on the armor of God. Be strong.
1:51:41
Believe in your God. Because when you do this, you will see God bring you
1:51:46
overwhelming victory every time.
1:51:57
When you stand firm and with all of your heart obey God,
1:52:04
it's about obedience. By the way, I want to say that one of the biggest reasons why I have
1:52:11
made it this far, seeing God's victory bring me through
1:52:18
attack after attack, is because I have made obedience to God the most important thing in my life.
1:52:27
For me, obedience to God is a must. There's no alternative.
1:52:33
It grosses me out to not obey God. That feels like hell on earth.
1:52:44
To love God is to obey God. The Bible says, "If you love me, keep my commands.
1:52:50
If you love me, feed my sheep." What God cares about more than anything is his sheep, his people. To encounter
1:52:57
him, to not encounter this religious old wine junk like the Pharisees had, but
1:53:04
the real him, the new wine, the power of God, revival.
1:53:11
Hallelujah. Obedience to God is how you touch his
1:53:18
heart the most. not obeying him in a way that you like,
1:53:23
but really obeying him, really being after his heart.
1:53:29
And for me, I I I could see I know I knew that his heart was completely about his
1:53:37
people receiving his power, receiving this revival, being healed, being freed.
1:53:43
So, I made the choice to be after God's heart. I made the choice that obeying God,
1:53:50
standing firm, being strong, being courageous, being whom God called me to be to
1:53:56
preach, to minister, that this was the most important thing in the world.
1:54:02
It didn't matter what the devil tried to do, I have to keep going.
1:54:08
When it's easy and fun, when it's hard and difficult and painful, I must obey
1:54:13
God. That is what's given me the strength.
1:54:21
That is what's given me the strength to stand firm, to be courageous. Because those are all action words. It's not
1:54:27
about a feeling. It's about obedience. You can do it because you have Christ in
1:54:32
you. Make the choice and God helps you. Make the choice to obey God and and he gives
1:54:39
you the strength and power and anything that you need to do it. Hallelujah.
1:54:48
I've seen tremendous reward beyond my wildest dreams for obeying God and
1:54:54
standing firm through every kind of attack. The best kind of reward is seeing God
1:55:02
pleased. That that's what brings you the most joy and peace and contentment on this earth
1:55:10
is knowing that your obedience touched God's heart.
1:55:16
And the next greatest reward that I have received is seeing revival spread and people be
1:55:24
touched by God's power and love. That's what came after persevering and
1:55:31
standing firm and being strong and courageous and looking at Goliath in the eye and not cowering down.
1:55:40
God gave this reward of revival. Hallelujah.
1:55:48
Not just that, but I experience more peace, joy, and abundant life in every area, every area now
1:55:55
than any moment in my life. God rewards those who diligently seek
1:56:01
him, who diligently are after his heart. Hallelujah.
1:56:07
And so, and so you in the Netherlands, if you will stand firm,
1:56:14
stand firm, not ever cowering down to the devil's
1:56:19
intimidation, God will reward you, will reward this
1:56:25
land with a mighty revival that will impact all of Europe
1:56:33
and beyond. You have to stand first though.
1:56:40
You have to go through that refining fire like I shared in my life.
1:56:45
And then the reward comes. But I'm telling you, it is coming.
1:56:51
I know that this word of God is true. Just as that word of God has come to pass, that revival is now. This word is
1:56:58
true for you in the Netherlands. Hallelujah.
1:57:07
Second Timothy 2:3, endure suffering along with me as a good soldier of
1:57:13
Christ Jesus.
1:57:19
As a good soldier. As a disciple of Jesus, you're called to
1:57:25
be a soldier. You're called to be a warrior. And what that means is that you fight
1:57:32
the good fight of faith. You aren't wimpy. You don't remain a baby Christian,
1:57:39
but you mature in the Lord. Sometimes it can feel good to be victim,
1:57:45
play victim to the devil, feels good to the flesh. Sometimes it
1:57:50
feels good to be babyed. But that is not your calling. Your calling is to mature and be a good
1:57:58
soldier. You can do it.
1:58:03
The devil seems scary, but he's wimpy. You can do it. You can stand firm. You
1:58:11
can fight this good fight of faith. If I can do it, you can do it.
1:58:21
And I really want to encourage you by my I I I pray you are encouraged by my story.
1:58:26
I pray because I have a such greater faith now than I did a couple years ago,
1:58:34
than I did four years ago, because I've seen time and time again, God come through for his revival.
1:58:43
For me, this was the first time I'm seeing this like God moving in power like this and revival. I didn't have
1:58:50
this example before me in terms of in America and other places. is just my spiritual father, but he was just in
1:58:56
Tanzania that I was seeing it. And I hadn't seen it. I only could hear his his testimonies of how he has overcome,
1:59:03
how God brought him victory. But you get to see now. I pray that this
1:59:10
faith is imparted to you. You get to see now with your own eyes
1:59:16
how faithful our God is.
1:59:22
how tiny the devil is. And so I pray I pray that all of you
1:59:28
that your spiritual eyes would open up so big today
1:59:34
that you would see God so differently from today. That he would grow
1:59:40
in your vision a million times.
1:59:45
His power and his ability to defeat the devil to split any kind of sea.
1:59:54
It's massive and it's unending. I pray your eyes would open up
2:00:01
to see how big your God is, how victorious your God is.
2:00:06
And I pray also that your eyes would open up to see how tiny the devil is.
2:00:12
how you're wasting your time. If you're feeling nervous
2:00:18
because of persecution, if you're feeling intimidation, if you're feeling stressed, if you're feeling worried when
2:00:24
persecution comes your way, I pray your eyes will open up so that
2:00:30
you may rest in the victory of Jesus. This revival is God's move. It is not my
2:00:38
move. It is not a church's move. It is not a ministry's move. It is not a denomination's move. It is not your
2:00:43
move. It is God's move.
2:00:50
Just as it was God's move for the Israelites to be delivered out of Egypt.
2:01:00
Just as it was God's move when Jesus came on this earth.
2:01:07
Just as it was God's move when God moved through the disciples, through the five-fold ministers in the
2:01:14
book of Acts, this is God's move just the same.
2:01:20
There are more for us than those against us.
2:01:26
I want to leave you with that. And that is something I had to learn. That's one of the devil's intimidation tactics.
2:01:33
Because the Pharisees are so loud, it can seem like there's more Pharisees
2:01:39
than those true believers. It's not true.
2:01:46
Look at the Pharisees. The number of Pharisees versus the versus the believers today.
2:01:54
Look at the number of Pharisees that were coming against Jesus versus the number of believers today. Billions in
2:02:01
this world. What that shows is that most people are
2:02:08
not evil in heart like that. There's a lot more people that want
2:02:14
Jesus and want revival than want to come against it.
2:02:22
And it's important that you have compassion to see the many people out there, many of them they their eyes
2:02:29
haven't seen yet. They don't know that revival has come. They don't know about God's power, but they have pure hearts
2:02:34
like you do. Like you did when you were blinded and you didn't know yet. There's
2:02:40
many out there in the Netherlands. There's many out there in Europe that
2:02:45
haven't seen yet. But their hearts want Jesus. Their hearts want revival.
2:02:51
But the Bible says, "How will they hear if if if no one goes and tells them the good news?"
2:02:59
And so God is bringing this reward of revival. There's a harvest out there
2:03:04
that is to be reached when you stand firm and have a heart for those many,
2:03:10
many, many people out there who will enter into this revival.
2:03:18
When I was going through persecution, I chose to put my eyes instead of the persecution, instead of the evil, I
2:03:24
chose to put my eyes on Jesus and his people. There were many times I went through
2:03:30
severe persecution and I had to go minister the very next day and it was hard. I'm fighting back tears. But I by
2:03:35
the grace of God put my eyes on Jesus and his people. There were people there that were hungry to receive Jesus. They
2:03:42
didn't care what the Pharisees had to say. They weren't going to listen to what the Pharisees had to say. They knew better. Their hearts were pure. They can
2:03:48
see God. And they came to receive freedom and healing. And I thank Jesus that he
2:03:53
strengthened me to put my eyes on him and them so that he could use me to
2:03:59
deliver them. And he did. Glory to God.
2:04:06
So God is saying to you now, lock your eyes on him,
2:04:11
on his power, on his faithfulness. Lock your eyes on your love for him that
2:04:19
you would love him with your life. And that means loving his people. Lock your eyes on the people out there, those you
2:04:26
know, those you don't, who will come into this revival once somebody tells them the good news, once their eyes open
2:04:33
up. And go be that light to them. Shine your
2:04:38
light and watch God move. Watch the watch the enemies of God be
2:04:44
scattered as God arises through this revival army.
2:04:49
It's time to arise, revival army. It's time for God's enemies to be
2:04:55
scattered. It's time. Stand to your feet. Arise.
2:05:00
Arise, revival army. This this con this event is so
2:05:06
prophetic. The name. It is time to arise army of God. It is time to stand firm to
2:05:15
stand up and stand for Jesus. Stand for Jesus's move. Stand for
2:05:22
Jesus's people who need to encounter him. And you will see God defeat every
2:05:29
battle. The devil is defeated. I declare the devil has lost big time today.
2:05:37
Big time today. And I declare right now
2:05:44
that all the devil's plans to try to hold back God's plans of
2:05:50
revival, massive revival, center of revival in Europe, in the Netherlands.
2:05:55
These plans of the devil, I declare them to be destroyed.
2:06:01
I declare all of the schemes of the devil to lose their power, to lose their
2:06:06
steam. I declare all of the negative voices to lose their power in Jesus
2:06:13
name. May all the negative voices be drowned out by the testimonies
2:06:19
of what Jesus is doing. The testimonies of revival in Jesus' name. I speak that
2:06:28
God's will must be done in this nation. His
2:06:33
revival must rain, must grow, must become massive in the Netherlands in
2:06:40
Jesus name.
2:06:45
And I declare that every one of you that your eyes would open up, your
2:06:52
spiritual eyes would open up and strength and boldness would come in you
2:06:58
to be a mighty revival warrior of God in
2:07:04
Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:07:09
Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
2:07:16
Thank you Jesus for victory. Thank you Jesus for victory for the Netherlands for your people. Thank you
2:07:24
Jesus for overwhelming victory over the devil.
2:07:29
Thank you Jesus. We praise you Jesus. We thank you Jesus.
2:07:35
We love you Jesus. We say yes and amen to your revival in the Netherlands, in
2:07:42
Europe, in Jesus name. Amen.
2:07:47
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:07:55
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Right now, the power of God is going to
2:08:02
be released upon all of you. If anybody here needs freedom or
2:08:08
healing, Jesus the deliverer and healer is here today to break every chain,
2:08:16
destroy every yoke, and bring healing to your bodies, to your minds.
2:08:23
Whatever kind of miracle you need, it is possible in this place today. It is
2:08:28
God's will that the works of the devil will be destroyed off of your life. And
2:08:34
it is God's will that you would be healed and freed. The Bible says by his
2:08:40
stripes, you are healed. We are healed.
2:08:46
That's a promise from God that shows that God wants you to be healed. He paid
2:08:53
the price already for you to be healed. Today is the day of accessing it because
2:08:58
God's main way of bringing healing and deliverance is by moving through his vessels and power just like he did with
2:09:04
the shadow of Apostle Peter just like he did through Apostle Paul as people came
2:09:10
to him brought handkerchiefs and aprons to his body brought it to the sick and demon oppressed and they were healed and
2:09:15
freed. This is the t this is the time to access these miracles that Jesus has paid the
2:09:22
price for. Hallelujah. Are you ready to receive?
2:09:29
And once this freedom and healing comes, God is going to pour out the fire of his spirit.
2:09:35
He's going to pour out impartation of anointing. God has sent me here today to
2:09:41
release his impartation because this revival is going to a high level from here. A high level in the Netherlands.
2:09:48
It is growing massively. And this h higher level of impartation
2:09:53
of anointing is needed for you revival warriors. Hallelujah.
2:10:00
Thank you Jesus. Every one of you right now, I encourage you to close your eyes and just take a moment with Jesus. Just
2:10:07
take a moment to talk to Jesus. Whatever he's convicting you of, whatever he's calling you to repent of, to surrender.
2:10:16
If you've never surrendered everything to Jesus, I encourage you to do the best thing you'll ever do in your life and
2:10:21
surrender to Jesus today. Give your life to him.
2:10:29
I encourage you to just speak right now whatever it is that you need to surrender to God. I encourage you to
2:10:35
tell him, "Lord, I I I send me. I will go. I will arise.
2:10:41
I will go through the valley for you. I will stand up to Goliath. I'll fight him. I encourage you to say, I'll fight
2:10:48
him to volunteer. Meaning, I will go through persecution.
2:10:55
I will go through being hated for your sake, Jesus.
2:11:00
I will go through this being misunderstood, false accusations. I'll do it, Lord,
2:11:06
because I love you. I encourage you to say this to God if if you mean this right now because this is
2:11:13
what God is asking for all of you. He's asking his army to arise for you to enlist in his army right now
2:11:20
to really be a soldier. Hallelujah.
2:11:29
If any of you are sensing demonic oppression manifesting in you, you can come to the front area to get deeper
2:11:35
into the shadow of anointing. God is going to be delivering and healing people from the front to the back. And
2:11:42
for everyone watching online,
2:11:47
his power is so great. And it's Jesus who does every miracle. Not me, not a
2:11:53
one-on-one prayer, but Jesus's power, which has no limits. His the same power
2:11:59
that was moving through Apostle Peter is moving here today where people just came under the shadow and they were all
2:12:05
healed and all freed. Thank you, Lord. You, hun, in the black shirt, can you come up to the stage, hun?
2:12:12

2:35:12

2:35:20
I speak healing to his mind. I speak freedom. I speak this autism must go in
2:35:26
Jesus name. Thank you, Holy Spirit. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
2:35:31
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Father. Right now, the power
2:35:38
of God is going to come upon every one of you
2:35:44
so mightily. I encourage every one of you to lift your faith because nothing is impossible
2:35:51
right now. And God wants to do any kind of miracle that you need right now. In the times of Peter, it says that all who
2:35:58
came under his shadow were healed and delivered. This is the shadow of today.
2:36:04
It means they came to position themselves where Peter was ministering, where the power of God was flowing
2:36:10
through Peter and all were healed. All were free because he was truly an
2:36:16
anointed apostle because he truly carried the real power of God. And not
2:36:22
just that highlevel power of God and not just that he walked in the authority of
2:36:28
Christ properly. What makes demons to go is when a servant of God really carries
2:36:34
anointing and also walks in the authority of Christ properly.
2:36:39
So what that means is how authority works is when someone who has the authority says something then that thing
2:36:46
happens to everyone like a president issues a law that law applies to
2:36:52
everyone. This is how it is in the spiritual realm. If any of you have demonic oppression, if any of you have
2:36:58
sickness and I with the authority of Christ that God has given me, when I
2:37:04
command the demons to go, when I command the sicknesses to go, the power of God,
2:37:09
Jesus Christ himself moves upon that execution of authority and makes every
2:37:16
single demon to go, every single sickness to go. The demons have to obey the genuine authority of Christ. The
2:37:23
demons have no choice. That's why you see these demons just having to leave. It's very simple in the spiritual realm.
2:37:30
It's very simple. You need the power and walk in the authority properly. That's it. And so that is what is here today.
2:37:37
It's like the axe church is alive today. So I'm telling you, do not miss out on
2:37:43
any miracle. Lift your faith. Lift your faith to believe how mighty and powerful
2:37:49
your God is. And also lift your faith to come in alignment with God's ways of moving. Because you are in alignment
2:37:56
with God's ways of moving and power, these miracles must happen in your life.
2:38:02
Lift your faith. Lift your faith to believe these truths with all of your heart.
2:38:08
I want to encourage you to speak these truths because that's what God counts as faith, not your feelings. Because the
2:38:13
devil the devil can send feelings. So maybe if you even feel a feeling of
2:38:19
doubt, you don't have to choose that. Speak I believe.
2:38:25
And that's what is counted in the spiritual realm as faith. So I want to encourage you right now to say I
2:38:32
believe. I believe in the power of God. The power of God
2:38:37
that the power of God the power of God is present is present
2:38:43
in this place. I believe I believe that because God
2:38:50
is here is here I will be healed I will be I will be free
2:38:56
I will be free anything is possible is possible
2:39:02
I receive I receive my miracle now
2:39:07
Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord
2:39:15
If any one of you has demonic oppression or sickness or anything that is not
2:39:20
God's portion, I encourage you right now to start renouncing it. To just start
2:39:25
saying, "I renounce anxiety. I renounce lack. I renounce suicidal thoughts. I renounce cancer." Whatever the
2:39:32
oppression or sickness is, start speaking it because this is a key that unlocks your freedom.
2:39:49
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
2:39:56
Thank you Jesus.
2:40:01
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you father.
2:40:08
I declare right now that every generational curse must be

cancel every demonic covenant. If any of you have ever said, "I want to die," or
2:40:46
something like that, renounce that. I cancel that demonic covenant of death
2:40:52
now in Jesus' name. And I detach you from everything you have renounced right

2:41:30
three. Thank you, Lord. I break every
2:41:39
generational curse, every curse off his life. I cancel every demonic covenant.
2:41:46
And I declare every last demon must go
2:41:53
in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
2:41:58
Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. I declare every spirit now of
2:42:04

2:43:13
declare every spirit of insecurity, every spirit speaking against your
2:43:18

God. Revival is now Netherlands.
2:55:09

2:55:15
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:55:24
You can head back to your seats right now and keep praising our God. Thank you, Jesus.
2:55:32
Thank you, Jesus.
2:55:39
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:55:52
Thank you Jesus. God, we praise you for everything you have done today. We thank you for the
2:55:58
countless miracles you have done Jesus. Thank you Jesus for your faithfulness.
2:56:05
Thank you Jesus for your power. Thank you Jesus for revival.
2:56:10
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:56:31
Thank you, Lord. How amazing is our God?
2:56:38
Wow. I'm so in awe of what Jesus has just done.
2:56:48
And you know, every single one of you have received mightily today. The word of God does not return void
2:56:55
ever. A big principle of receiving miracles is faith.
2:57:02
Is faith that you know sometimes you don't feel anything but the miracle indeed happened. There was lepers who
2:57:09
came to Jesus. He said, "Show yourselves to the priests." And the Bible said on their way to the priest they were
2:57:15
healed. Meaning when they were in the presence of Jesus they didn't feel or see any change but they indeed had just
2:57:23
been healed and the miracle would manifest as they kept their faith. Amen.
2:57:31
So God moves in this way today still. So sometimes you can see an immediate
2:57:36
manifestation that the miracle has taken place but oftent times you don't feel anything. You don't sense anything
2:57:43
different but the miracle has indeed happened in the spiritual realm and and
2:57:49
you will see it manifest maybe tonight maybe tomorrow maybe in a couple days
2:57:54
maybe in a couple weeks. I've seen so many of these testimonies where the miracle manifested later, but they they
2:58:02
received it when the anointing came upon them. So, this is going to be the case for many of you here. So, I I really
2:58:10
encourage you to not disvalue what you have just received. But, but grab your
2:58:17
miracle in faith. Do not leave this place without grabbing your miracle and
2:58:23
protecting it. Amen. So say we're gonna we're going to practice right now. I am healed.
2:58:32
I am free. I am anointed.
2:58:37
Thank you Jesus for the miracle or miracles
2:58:44
you have just done. Amen. Keep keep declaring that.
2:58:53
Hallelujah. Keep declaring that and keep thanking God. And this is how the devil can't
2:58:59
steal what you have received. This is how you'll see it manifest. Amen.
2:59:05
Hallelujah. The Bible says, "Where your treasure is,
2:59:12
your heart will be also." I want to share with you that a big part
2:59:19
of me transforming to be a strong warrior
2:59:25
of God who can withstand persecution and attacks of the devil.
2:59:31
One of the big keys was to put my treasure, meaning my life, my surrender,
2:59:38
my obedience, my time, my energy, my gifts, my weaknesses, and my money
2:59:46
to God's kingdom. Putting my treasures there, because those are all of our treasures in some
2:59:52
way. Putting my treasure of my surrendering my life
2:59:58
made my heart go there. made my heart go to God's kingdom so
3:00:04
powerfully. Made my heart to be a heart of grit in the face of the devil.
3:00:11
Made my heart to be strong. Amen. So, I want to encourage you all. We're
3:00:17
going to take a moment to give to God right now through offering. And I want to encourage you to do the same right
3:00:23
now. to give all of your life to Jesus including treasure treasure of money to give that
3:00:31
to him. It it makes your heart to come more for God and his kingdom. It's a
3:00:37
supernatural transformation that takes place. It's that principle of where you put your treasure, your heart will there
3:00:44
will be there also. And those of you in the Netherlands and in Europe, this is
3:00:50
very important that you take a stand in every way. That you take a stand of
3:00:55
obedience in every way, which includes sacrificing, sacrificing financially for
3:01:01
God's move. Amen. One of the reasons this is important is because
3:01:08
to bring heaven to earth in the way that God wants in such a big capacity is not free. His miracles are free to receive
3:01:15
the word of God. You came here today, it's free. But for for the those who put
3:01:22
on the event, it was not free financially, right? And so it's so
3:01:28
important that we all do our part to bring heaven to earth in this way. I
3:01:35
mean to to sew financially so that God can do great works. We we had a venue
3:01:41
change. We got a bigger venue. It was a much greater cost because we didn't want anyone to miss out. Amen. So, I want to
3:01:50
encourage you to give back. Give give thanksgiving to God.
3:01:56
Show value for what you have received. Show value for his work, for his power
3:02:01
by giving back. Amen. Hallelujah. And as you do this, God rewards. God blesses
3:02:08
you. The Bible says that when you bring the tithe into the storehouse, test me. Bring it and see that I won't pour out
3:02:14
so many blessings that there's no room in your lap for all of the blessings.
3:02:19
I've seen this come to pass in my life where I am overwhelmed with the blessings of God from spiritual to
3:02:25
physical blessings. But a big part of that is because I put my treasure, my whole life, including
3:02:33
finances to God's kingdom. what you sow. When you sow, when you sow
3:02:39
generously, the Bible says you reap generously. I can tell you that verse is true and it's come to pass in my life.
3:02:46
So, I encourage you to give cheerfully. Amen. And to give thanks to God in this
3:02:51
way of action right now. And as you do it, as you do this, this is powerful in the spiritual realm because it's showing
3:02:58
your value. It's showing like you are ready to fight the good fight of faith
3:03:04
in every way. You're not going to let the devil push you around. You're not going to let the devil hold back
3:03:10
revival, but you're here to stand and fight in every way in the spiritual realm, in the spirit. Amen. Hallelujah.
3:03:18
Hallelujah. So, I want to thank all of you for giving, for contributing to this event, this work of God. Um, the ways
