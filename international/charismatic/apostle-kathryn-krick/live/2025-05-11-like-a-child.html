 We have some important and wonderful, exciting announcements for you before Apostle Catherine comes out.
 Glory to God. We have a live stream schedule coming up this week again. Amen.
 Are you ready? Every live stream. Amazing.
 Apostle will be live this Wednesday, the 14th of May at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
 So be sure to tune in. All social media platforms. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
 Instagram subscriber live. Hallelujah. How many of you are enjoying those?
 Glory to God. Glory to God. If you are not yet subscribed to Apostle Catherine on Instagram, you should do it today.
 Don't wait another day. Don't wait. Right after service, you subscribe to Apostle Catherine and then you can go live with her on Instagram.
 She usually goes live weekly and it's usually a Q&A and you get more than you ever dreamed of.
 So there will be an Instagram subscriber live this Friday, May 16th at 4 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
 Instagram only. Then the replay she puts out for everybody. Amen.
 Hallelujah. Glory to God. We get so much meat around here. Meat, meat, meat. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Are you new to 5F Church? We are excited for you to be here. Amen.
 If you are new, we welcome you and we love you. We love you.
 And we want you to fill out the connection card that you'll find on your seat.
 It's got a place for you to put your name and your email address so we will be able to connect with you, let you know of everything that's going on, all the things that are happening locally and globally. Amen.
 So if you would fill out that card and turn it into the welcome table in the lobby on your way out, you will be on our mailing list and you will know what's going on around here. Amen.
 Hallelujah. And we love in this house to share testimonies.
 If it wasn't for testimonies, I wouldn't even be here.
 Testimonies have brought so many and they're bringing in the world. Your testimony matters.
 Your testimony is so alive and vibrant and powerful that you don't even know. You've just got to share it.
 We have a special time today for you to share your testimony of what God has done for you, what you have received, what you have encountered in this end time revival at 5F Church, at Arise and Shine, at any live, even in a replay, healing, miracle, deliverance, transformation.
 Time for you to share it to the world. Amen.
 And we have a special testimony team that wants to video your testimony directly after service.
 So we would really invite you and encourage you. I encourage you go into the lobby and we have the testimony room back over there to the left.
 Share your testimony. Your testimony gives God glory big time.
 Your testimony causes other people's faith to arise so high they can believe God for what you received. Amen.
 Hallelujah. And your testimony defeats the devil and overcomes his lying schemes.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
 And right now, simultaneously as we are speaking in English, we have a Spanish and Portuguese translation available for anybody who wants to hear it in that language.
 You will just go to the comments on Facebook or YouTube and you will see the link there.
 Click the link and you can hear this in Spanish or Portuguese. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
 Praise God. And what is coming up? What's coming up in a week and a half?
 Revival is now Toronto, Canada. Hallelujah.
 Glory to God. Don't miss out on your opportunity to be at this revival.
 This is a one night event. This is free. This is going to change Toronto, change Canada.
 God says, I'm sending my apostle to Toronto. Hallelujah.
 And revival is breaking out in Toronto. Hallelujah.
 It's going to be May 23rd. Go ahead and register to go. Get your tickets, plane tickets.
 If you're not in that area, if you're in Toronto, you must be there.
 Pastors bring churches, being family, being friends. Be there and receive.
 God has something amazing and he will demonstrate his power.
 He will demonstrate his power in that revival. Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. And we know that apostle's book, wow.
 I can't even say all that this book is doing. Unlock Your Deliverance is available now.
 It's available for you. If you haven't got your first copy, get your first copy and then get another 10.
 And then get another 10 and pass them out.
 Unlock Your Deliverance is available wherever books are sold online.
 Amazon, Barnes & Noble. You're going to find them in bookstores everywhere. Hallelujah.
 God is moving through this book. Get your copy. It is amazing.
 And your life and the lives of everyone you put this book into their hand will change forever.
 Amen. Hallelujah. Now we have some very special announcements, especially for those watching online and those who are not in the local LA area.
 We have small groups and they officially started. Hallelujah. Small groups.
 The church is multiplying. Amen.
 You can go to 5fchurch.org.slash.smallgroups to sign up if you want to be in a small group.
 Now the purpose of these small groups is to gather together in fellowship for those who can't be with us in person in LA.
 Okay? It's going to be in other states. It's going to be in other countries.
 The small groups will be for people who want to be planted and are planted at 5F but want to go and attend a small group or even be part of that online community in their area.
 So we even have some in Northern California and in San Diego.
 And then last week you saw 36 around the world already. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. They're starting up. They're starting up. Hallelujah.
 So there is now also a Spanish speaking small group for all those in the US who speak Spanish.
 Isn't that wonderful? I love it.
 And if you don't see a small group in your state or your nation, you can sign up for the one that's nearest to you. Okay?
 And if you speak French, parlez-vous français, but you live in a different French nation other than France, you can join the France group.
 Same goes for other languages. Okay?
 So if you happen to speak that language, you don't live in that country, but you want to be part of that, you can join that group so you can communicate in that language with the others in the same group.
 With the others in the small group. Amen. I love the small groups. I love the small groups.
 The Acts Church is restored. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Small group coming to you soon. Amen.
 Hallelujah. And we will be back here at Belosco Theater for all the rest of May, Sundays at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
 Glory to God. Hallelujah.
 I will invite you to rise now and to stand.
 Hallelujah.
 And let us welcome our beloved, beautiful, spiritual mom, Apostle Catherine Crick.
 Hallelujah.
 Actually, before she comes on, we wanted to wish Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers who are here and online.
 Happy Mother's Day and Happy Mother's Day to our spiritual mom, Apostle Catherine.
 Hallelujah.
 The Bible says to give honor where honor is due, and we honor you this day. Amen.
 We have a video we want to show you of some of our 5F family just sharing testimonies of their lives being changed in this anointing.
 Let's watch.
 Mother's Day, Apostle Catherine, I want to honor you so much and share that since being at 5Full Church,
 I have been delivered from stagnancy in my relationship with God, feeling not enough, being a victim to the lies of the enemy.
 I am flourishing in my relationship with Jesus. I have peace and joy like never before.
 And I feel like I am the most blessed person on the entire planet to get to have you as my spiritual mother.
 Happy Mother's Day, Apostle Catherine. I want to thank you that four years ago in a park,
 there was an impartation given from God through you to me, and from that moment, my life has totally changed.
 And because of that impartation, literally hundreds, if not thousands of people have been set free, delivered, and healed.
 Happy Mother's Day, Apostle Catherine. You truly are my spiritual mother. You are my mentor. God has used you mightily in my life,
 yes, to release to me the impartation from a powerless pastor to now casting out demons, signs and wonders, healings happening all the time.
 I thank God that you have persevered, that you have persevered in love, that you have pursued God for us.
 And we are so grateful at True Grace Church. We love you.
 Happy Mother's Day, Spiritual Mom.
 Before 5F Church, I was in witchcraft. I was in the occult. And as a result, I lost control of my body.
 Too many demons. So I was suffering a lot. I prayed and prayed.
 And Jesus answered my prayers by bringing me to 5F Church, where the anointing is.
 And now that I'm at 5F, I'm free. I have my body back. And I feel peace and joy now.
 And I honor you so much.
 Happy Mother's Day, Mama. It's such an honor and such a pleasure to be able to serve you and to serve 5F Church.
 Before I planted myself at 5F, I struggled with a lot of things. All throughout my college years, I struggled with my identity.
 I had, I never had these struggles growing up. And I was searching for God in all the wrong places.
 Finally, it led me to Christ. And then Jesus led me to you.
 I no longer struggle with these thoughts. I'm set free. I'm full of joy and peace.
 Happy Mother's Day.
 Happy Mother's Day, Apostle Catherine. I just want to tell you, you're the most amazing, wonderful, phenomenal spiritual leader and mother anybody could ask for.
 Because of your humble servant, selfless, loving heart, so many of us have not only been delivered, but we've also had a safe place to heal and to grow.
 And I just want to say thank you. I can tell you that prior to coming to 5F Church, my life was a prison.
 I was literally living in a box of my house. I'm not living from doctor's appointment to doctor's appointment anymore.
 I am living in the abundant life and I am watching the hand of God move in every aspect of my life.
 And so thank you. I love you. I honor you. And I pray you have the most amazing Mother's Day ever.
 Happy Mother's Day, Mama. I have never had a spiritual leader as pure as you.
 Over the past two years, as you've been my spiritual mother, I have been healed and set free from chronic insomnia, fear, anxiety, chronic fatigue, being a Pharisee.
 Grief from my dad passing away and my body is the strongest it has ever been in my life.
 This anointing has greatly improved the relationship with my mom and transformed her life and healed her in so many ways.
 I have received such pure joy, peace and love. I'm so thankful and grateful that you are my spiritual mother and that you care for all of your spiritual children so well and that you care for us so much.
 Happy Mother's Day. I am so grateful to God for bringing me to 5F Church where I received freedom that I never thought was possible.
 Before I came to 5F, I was so, so depressed. I was afraid of everything and it felt like my world was falling apart at all times.
 I have just transformed more and more as I've continued to serve God here, as I've given more and more of myself to God and serving in this move.
 I have seen him do miracles in my life. He has untangled my brain. I used to have dyslexia and it is gone.
 I'm so grateful to have you as my spiritual mother to share your spiritual DNA and to learn from everything you say and everything you don't say.
 And to be able to watch you navigate so many different situations and circumstances with such grace and strength is a way of a blessing that I really will never be able to put into words.
 I'm so grateful to God for you and I pray that on this Mother's Day you feel all of the love from all of your spiritual children in all 158 nations.
 Happy Mother's Day, Mama!
 I want to invite everyone to stand as we honor our spiritual mother, our leader.
 I want to thank you so much for your purity and for your example, for all of us to see how we can be transformed just like you, how we can seek God just like you and be purified in our hearts just like you.
 I thank you so much for your example. One of the things I love about you is that even though you have thousands of spiritual children, you care for every single one of them.
 And you take this calling so serious and you take all this sheep that you've been entrusted with so seriously from God.
 And I truly respect that and love that so much about you.
 Thank you so much for leading us in purity and love and fire. Thank you, Mama.
 Happy Mother's Day.
 And here's a few beautiful flowers.
 We just want to say this is from True Grace Church.
 Hallelujah.
 Glory to God. Thank you so much.
 Thank you, everyone. Thank you. You can have a seat, everybody. Praise God.
 Thank you so much to everyone in that video, everyone who's wished me Happy Mother's Day.
 I'm so humbled. All glory to God. I give God all the glory for every single miracle mentioned, testimony, and transformation in all of these people's lives and all of your lives.
 It is only by God's grace and power that any of these miracles happened. Amen.
 And we are blessed and honored and humbled to be vessels of him. Amen.
 But I thank Jesus for this precious anointing that could touch all of you, that could touch all of those people in this video and transform you all.
 Thank you, Jesus, for your power. Thank you, Jesus, for changing all of these lives and bringing all of these miracles.
 Thank you, Jesus, for this honor to be a vessel. Thank you, Jesus, for all of the miracles you do that we can't even count, that you have left us in awe again and again and again.
 Thank you, Jesus. And I thank you, Jesus, for all the things you've done to help me be transformed to be a vessel of you and a servant of you.
 Thank you for giving me an amazing, the most amazing spiritual father who helped me to be transformed into your image and receive this anointing. Amen. Amen. Amen.
 Glory to God. Glory to God. Truly thank you so much. My heart is so, so, so, so, so touched today from seeing all of that. Thank you.
 I feel your love so much and I truly love you so much. It was my biggest dream to be a mom by now, a physical mom.
 But the Lord has brought me so much contentment and being a spiritual mother.
 And it is such an honor. And I thank God for his perfect ways because he knows that in this season of my life and up till now that I need to I needed to devote every moment
 possible to being a spiritual mother to so many children, spiritual children, to so many of you around the world.
 And I thank God for his perfect ways. They are truly perfect. And I thank God for giving me all of you as spiritual children, all of you from across the world.
 Amen. I feel your love so much. And the thing that blesses me more than anything in the world is your testimonies and just seeing how God has transformed your life.
 Amen. And just seeing how you become amazing disciples, amazing disciples that don't stay a baby but grow so that you can be powerful vessels of God.
 Thank you. Thank you for being amazing spiritual children, amazing disciples. I love you so much with the love of Jesus. I love you so much.
 And when I think of you often, I pray of you often. If ever I see your comments or emails, I'm praying for you. And you are in my heart so deeply.
 So thank you. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
 Well, I want to welcome every one of you here who are here for the first time. Welcome all of our first time visitors. Is this anybody here? Can you raise your hands?
 Welcome! Welcome! Amazing! We are so blessed to have you here with us. And I know we have visitors from around the U.S. Where are you? Can I see you?
 Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! And I know we have many international visitors today. We have Fiji here. Can I see you if you're from Fiji?
 Welcome! We have South Africa. Hi! Welcome! We have Canada. Welcome! Austria. Welcome! And Mexico. Welcome!
 And Germany. Hi! Welcome! And I hear you have a testimony.
 Francisca? Francisca? Is that you? Can you come here?
 Welcome! I hear you have a testimony from when you were watching online. Your friend?
 Yes, a friend of mine. And we came yesterday. We go tomorrow back to Germany and Austria. And we are just here because we know that Jesus healed our friend, the daughter of my friend.
 And yes, we did the long way to meet Jesus over here.
 And what happened? How was she healed?
 It's not happening now, but I can hear if you say it's a testimony for today. So it will happen.
 Oh, okay. Amen. Amen. I'm not sure if I got this right, but there was a testimony that was shared. Maybe it was from someone else.
 But I want to mention this. One of you shared this testimony. You received healing on the soles of your feet. For four years she felt like she was walking on burning coals, but now has been healed as God has touched her through the screen.
 This was a testimony that was shared today. Is that somebody? You? Can you come and share?
 So it was the South Africa testimony, not a Germany. Come on. Hallelujah. Can you share?
 For a long time, the soles of my feet is like walking on burning coals. And you learn to manage it. You don't put your feet down. You use it up everywhere.
 One morning, I was on the stage where I was looking for more. More than going to church, more than going back home with all the stuff.
 And I was on the stage that, you know, why be Christian if you don't experience the living God?
 And after a silent time and quiet time in the morning, I went through Facebook. The only thing I can remember was for those listening online as well.
 And my feet got ice cold. It was October, so I've got a blanket. You know, it's cold. And I closed it up, thought, okay, the floor is cold.
 And later that afternoon, I realized that it's not burning anymore. So, thanks for the Lord.
 For anyone that does not know how it feels to have burning feet 24-7 would not understand, you know, my testimony.
 Okay, after that, I went into, you know, what happened. Since then, no sore feet, no sore foot soles. Restless legs is no more.
 A ligament in 96 with netball was torn. No more pain, no more swelling.
 You know, we farm in South Africa. And since being planted, we had a storm in December, I think.
 We literally, the farms next to us, you know, the irrigation pivots, it was turned. It was, I don't know what storm it was.
 But if you see the neighbors and you see where everything happened, that storm had to split. It did not go over our farm.
 And that's glory to God. That's glory to God. So, yeah.
 Praise God! Hallelujah! Thank you for sharing. Praise God! Wow. Wow. Hallelujah.
 And this is as she watched online, all the way from South Africa. We're here in LA. So, all of you watching online, first of all, welcome.
 Second of all, get ready to encounter God's power. Anything is possible. Revival is now His healing.
 Power is moving to break chains, destroy yolks, and remove sicknesses and pain, and do any kind of miracle. Amen?
 Hallelujah! Praise God!
 So, everybody watching online, share this livestream with your friends and your family so that they can receive too, so that they can receive miracles too.
 The harvest is right now. And so, when you share, you're going to be, you would be amazed at how many people are going to be blessed and received from God.
 And become believers and be set free just because you shared.
 So, make sure you share, share, share. Spread this good news. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. I also want to say happy Mother's Day. Everyone of you who are mothers here and everyone of you watching online who are mothers.
 Hallelujah. I know today is going to be an amazing day where God's power is going to come upon your lives.
 And I believe it will be the best Mother's Day ever. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. God is good. God is faithful.
 And He holds your children in the palm of His hands.
 Sometimes He allows things to happen because He allows something to happen for a person to hit rock bottom to seek Him.
 So, whatever is going on in your life right now with your children, I want you to know God is covering them.
 God's hand is upon their life because He cares about them so much. Because you have come to Him and you have surrendered to Him.
 So, He cares for your children. He cares for them. He is moving. He is faithful. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. Well, I want to also welcome everyone who has become planted this past week at Fivefold Church,
 who has become part of the family, the Fivefold Church family from around the world.
 So, we have 129 new Fivefold family members. Praise God.
 From all of these nations and states, welcome. We are so blessed to have you join our Fivefold Church family.
 And we're so excited and expectant for what your life is going to look like from now.
 Because the anointing is going to come upon your life so powerfully. And your life will be a life of miracles.
 Your life will be supernatural. Your life will be covered by God's power.
 And you will be equipped to walk in your purpose and carry the anointing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So exciting.
 Also so exciting for everyone around the world, everyone, all of our Fivefold Church family from around the world,
 is that small groups have begun this week, this past week. Hallelujah.
 I'm so excited. I've been seeing pictures. I've been seeing updates. And God has been moving powerfully in these small groups.
 I'm so excited for what he's done and what he's going to continue to do.
 And it's so exciting that we have so many, I think, 37, 36, I think, small groups we have so far.
 And we'll have more as time goes. But yeah, these small groups, by the way, are for everybody.
 Everybody. Not just those who are planted. But this is a time to invite people.
 This is a time to bring in the harvest. Hallelujah.
 So this is one of the things I'm so excited about is that it's going to be an opportunity for seeds to be planted in a new way.
 For you to come gather together, come on the Zoom, and have that fellowship together.
 I believe many people will come. They will come hungering for fellowship. They will come hungering for that.
 And God will meet them there. Amen? Praise God.
 So if you're watching online, you can go to www.fiveofchurch.org.org.org small groups to see the nearest small group nearest to you.
 And you can sign up for that one. And they'll get back to you with all of the info.
 The leader of the small group will get back to you with all the details. Amen.
 We have some of them are joining right now live. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
 All right. So we have a testimony, a couple of testimonies that I'm so excited for you to hear what God has done.
 I want to invite Diane and Aiden and your friend.
 Hallelujah, Aiden. It's so good to see you.
 I'm so happy to see you alive and thriving.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Yes. Hallelujah.
 We are so excited for what God has done. We are so excited for the healing he has brought, the resurrection he has brought.
 We are so overjoyed. We are so thankful to God for his hand upon your life.
 Do you want to share just a little bit? Yeah. So this happened like maybe a month ago.
 It was I just had this horrible stomach ache for four hours. It was really bad.
 I just I didn't know what was happening. And then I passed out and I woke up and I saw my dad there.
 And he was like, I was like, Dad, what's happening? Am I OK? And then he was like, you fell.
 And I just I passed out again. And it was so dark. I just felt like I was being lifted.
 Like I felt myself lifting. And I think if I was more conscious at the time, I would be thinking that this is the end.
 But then I woke up in the hospital room. I was so confused and I couldn't even speak because I had like a breathing tube in.
 But they told me that they had to do this surgery on me because I had a.
 Yeah, ruptured vessel in my spleen. And it was just so scary.
 But I'm better now. And I just wanted to thank all of you for all of your prayers. I wanted to thank you, Apostle Most.
 But most of all, I wanted to thank God because I was without oxygen for seven minutes.
 They thought I was dead. But now I'm here and I'm fine. And I'm just so glad to be here.
 Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
 And God is so good. I remember during the prophetic ministry time, I was, you know, the Lord just puts things on my heart to speak.
 And sometimes I don't know what they are, really. I don't really know what ruptured really means anything.
 And I think I've ever spoken that I don't remember ever speaking that before. But that Sunday, your mom was here.
 And I remember and I said, there's something ruptured. Be healed now in Jesus name. And then you testified it was around that time or?
 You gave me the book, Unlock Your Deliverance, and you imparted anointing on me.
 And literally after I was shooting your book at the beach, we were hanging out with all of you, 5F, beautiful, pure hearted people down there.
 And literally after I finished doing the video, I uploaded on social media promoting your book.
 I got a text, oh, 911 is here. I'm like, go check. Who is it? I thought he was a neighbor.
 And then we didn't know that he was Aidan. So immediately had to go to the airport and texted everybody, hey, please pray for my son.
 And then I communicated, I think, with Jan Tal. And it's crazy how on the way to the airport, there was this nudge, which I don't think I mentioned before.
 It says this is happening because you need to stop what you're doing with 5F and Apostle.
 There was that little, little voice. And I said, stop it. Stop it. I'm going to go on fire for God.
 You won't be able to stop me because I'm here for Jesus and nobody can stop me. Nobody.
 You stood up to Goliath. Hallelujah. I'm proud of you.
 And then after that, I mean, you guys know the story already, but I just want to really emphasize ever since I came here, you guys know already my story.
 Five years refining fire, literally like job-like experience, high success, stripped off almost everything.
 And then this is like the exclamation mark of my refining fire. Abraham, Isaac, remember that?
 So when I got your message, you said, do not fear. God is protecting him and healing him for some reason.
 I mean, it's Jesus, obviously. I have this sense of peace and sense of confidence that Aiden is going to be fine.
 So it's super important that our words that we declare truly happen like Apostle. Everything she says. Don't even doubt it. It's going to happen.
 Right. So that sense of peace and confidence that I have, I never panicked. I never cried. I never complained either.
 Like literally, I saw my husband's like wreck in the bathroom. I said, honey, let's let's pray. But he's just wrecked, you know, but I have this most secure sense of peace.
 And you would think, I mean, and I also told God, I said, God, if it's your time to take Aiden, you are so perfect in your ways.
 I trust you and I love you. It's your will. And I'm OK with that. I'm OK with that.
 So I think like what Apostle said on the Unlock Your Deliverance book, I hope all of you bought it already. Buy more.
 She said in there, it's very simple. And I love how your books are so simple, so basic, but so good, so impactful. It's so simple.
 Sometimes God delays the miracle because he wants us to be more humble, which I need. I'm kind of very prideful person because I've achieved such success.
 I need to be more humble to be more humble, surrender and to increase our faith, to really believe in his goodness and not rely on our strength and the things that we know.
 So all of those things that that really like everything that you're saying, I'm trying like to just really study and apply it.
 And I've shared to you a lot of things that has been happening in my life, like just abundance after abundance after abundance.
 I cannot really say all the things, but I mean, you guys have seen the TV show that just brought up last week and there's like two big opportunities in business as well.
 So all I'm saying is that the emptying of ourselves is so crucial if we want God to use us, if we want God to live inside of us.
 And I spoke about this about comparing a regular car and a Tesla. Okay, I kid you not, yesterday it was such a struggle.
 I never rent a car because I've been driving a Tesla for over 10 years. Okay, so I we park our car at Disneyland.
 I forgot to lock it because usually Tesla, it just self drive. You just get in, it opens the door, you get in, it brings you wherever you want to go.
 Okay, so I feel like that's the anointing. It's like this software that just downloads on you and just protects you.
 It drives you where you need to go. You don't even need to open your eyes. Literally, I've gone home sleeping.
 Yes, that has happened. But also the flash could be there too. So that's why they said if you drive a Tesla, you need to be awake.
 Your flash could sometimes, right, sometimes could like run a red light that is not safe for you. But the anointing, we all have it.
 If we just allow Jesus, the anointing to drive our life, we could be so successful and live such an abundant life. Sorry Aiden, I'm taking your thunder.
 Amen, amen, hallelujah. And I just wanted to like lastly share the prophetic ministry. I was speaking about this earlier on the subscriber Q&A as I was answering a question for people trying to understand understanding the prophetic.
 And it's not so much like that we have that the word has to be spoken exactly exact word that you need healing or freedom for for it to happen.
 Because remember in the times of Peter, everyone who came under his shadow, all were healed and freed. So it doesn't say that he went through a list of 5000 different ailments that he spoke them aloud, you know, the anointing is so powerful.
 And what's important is that the vessel carries the anointing and authority because that's God's way of releasing miracles. But the big purpose of the prophetic is to open up eyes of God's love for you and how he how he knows you and knows what you need.
 It's not late, you know, and so was it was it do you know, do you know when that half the rupture happened like according to was it right after church.
 So it must have happened, I would say usually you pray over everybody in general prayer around 320 ish.
 It was like it would have been like 250 probably.
 Because Sam you had a tummy ache around to around to.
 So the rupture would have happened around between two and 250. Whoa, I didn't know that so right now glory to God. So the prophetic word. So the reason why I wanted to share that with you is for you is because through this through the prophetic.
 God is showing God is showing you that he was there with you the whole time. He wasn't late. He was there to release that healing and resurrection life immediately not a second too late.
 Just like with Lazarus being risen from the dead. Jesus wasn't late. It's just that God wanted to do a greater miracle and reveal more glory through this greater miracle of resurrection.
 Because he knew that these disciples Lazarus his sisters Mary and Martha were mature enough to handle that test to then be used for God's glory.
 Praise God. Hallelujah.
 And Sam is that your name. I've seen both of you have this hunger for Jesus to share the unlock your deliverance books. And even yesterday I saw videos of you sharing it. Both of you I saw videos of you sharing it at Disneyland.
 I am so proud of you and God is so proud of you and God is using you so powerfully at a young age. Both of you people are watching and being inspired and being empowered and motivated and feeling conviction from God to be bold to have a heart for others and to serve him to share the book too.
 So I am so proud of you both. God is so proud of you. And I just want to release this anointing upon you right now that the power of God would move through you. The love of Jesus would come upon you more and more.
 And your light would shine so bright leading many to Jesus in Jesus name. I release this anointing upon you and I speak protection over your whole body and health that the devil can never touch you.
 I declare you are safe in God's hands. You will live a long abundant life for the glory of God because God has great plans to use you for his glory. May the power of God fill you in Jesus name and may your light shine so brightly.
 May all the words of people, all the negative words of people that have been spoken about you, may they fall away. And all of the sorrow and heaviness that's come through those words, they must leave you in Jesus name.
 And I speak joy to fill you, fire of God to fill you in Jesus name and great peace. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 I just have this gift for you. It's a bouquet made out of pages from your Unlock Your Deliverance book. I just, it symbolizes how these pages, they're the key to unlock this anointing and unlock this deliverance.
 Like, I used to have anxiety, I used to have doubt, but after this situation I've just felt so right with God and my relationship with him is getting so much stronger day by day.
 And I'm really grateful for what you're doing for everyone here. And I just wanted to give you this to celebrate Mother's Day. I encourage you.
 So beautiful. This is one of the most beautiful gifts I've ever gotten. Thank you. Wow. Thank you so much. Thank you. Wow. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you all. Wow. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. And today's message is called Like a Child. Look, the children are teaching today. Hallelujah. Oh, Jesus. Praise God. Wow. I'm in awe.
 I want to invite Rebecca. Rebecca.
 Hi, Rebecca. Hallelujah. So, oh, thank you so much. Thank you. So you, here, I can take it for you. Thank you so much. Oh, your kids drew it. Thank you so much. Wow. Thank you.
 So you have shared a couple testimonies just in one week within a couple days that literally left me in awe and blessed me so much. And I would love for you to share them with everyone.
 Okay, yeah, the ones with the book, passing the book out. Okay. Oh, Lord, help me. So I've been having my kids and I have been having so much fun passing the book out. It's just been like the perfect tool that we've been longing for and we didn't know to share with people.
 Because truly it has keys that have blessed my life and changed my life and in my family. And so we've been having so much fun. And after your message last Sunday, I had you share that, you know, divine encounters are going to happen more.
 God's been touching people. I just grabbed hold of that because I've been passing the book out and I just wanted it to be, you know, this divine encounter that I'm that they would be ready for it. And then, you know, God would confirm.
 And so I went to Costco. Okay, you're not going to believe this, but they're here today.
 Welcome.
 On the back row.
 Where?
 Right there.
 Hi.
 Praise God. We welcome you.
 Okay, so I went to into Costco with the book, just knowing that God had, you know, someone he wanted to bless. And to be honest, like I was, I was not like feeling the fire, but I just know being equipped by the teachings that it's not a feeling. It's a choice. Just obedience.
 So I'm just like, I have this book. I know you're going to bless someone. I had all my kids, my husband, and, you know, like bringing it around Costco with me. And I'm just like, okay, Lord, I know you have someone finally at the very end. We're sitting down eating.
 It was very busy there that day. And I just I hadn't written in the book yet. I'd like to write a little note, you know, to just bless people. And so I was like, I asked my husband if he could take the kids out. He took the kids to the car to load up.
 And I just sat there at the table writing the note. And as I'm sitting there, this couple, this beautiful couple comes over and they needed a table. And I, and there was no tables left. So I was just like, okay, you can have my table.
 And I just went over to the counter and kept writing the note. And I was like, God's like, give the book, you know. And so anyway, to keep it short, there was another man that I went and talked to first. And he kindly said, no, I don't think I'll read it.
 But as I'm sharing with him, they're kind of looking over at me. And so I was like, okay, I've got to, you know, give this book to them. And as I go there and say, I have this book I would love to bless you with.
 The lady, Laura, it's her name. She says, we follow her online. They already knew about apostle Catherine about you. They already knew. And they were like wanting to come in person. And it was just this divine encounter.
 I'm just so thankful that God worked it out that way.
 And share why it's a real big miracle. Because they didn't know I'm here to minister.
 Yeah, so they shared that we didn't know she's back in LA every Sunday, right? Yeah. Because you travel so much. And online it could probably look like you're all over the world, you know.
 But I was like, no, she comes back every Sunday. You know, we're so blessed, literally, that you come back every Sunday for us.
 And yeah, and they were to see their joy and the childlike heart. Like we were all like kids in Costco, right? We were like jumping.
 We all knew it was God that set this up. And I was just like a little child. And they have the most beautiful, I can already tell, humble hearts, childlike faith just to be so excited. And it was confirmation for them and for me.
 Yes, and I was so blessed when I heard that testimony because I remember you sharing, like you had said, we've been wanting to come, but she's never there because she's always traveling.
 So, because they only live like a little more than an hour away or something. So this to me is such a miracle. Like God wanted you here, but you didn't know.
 And so God sent Rebecca as a messenger and used the tool of the book to engage in this conversation. Jesus. And God is going to do many miracles in your life today and moving forward.
 Hallelujah. Okay. And then a couple days later is something. Another one more. So we live right next to a park, which is amazing place to pass out books.
 So, and so I meet a lot of people at the park and I always have, but I've always kind of felt like I didn't know how to start conversations. I didn't have the right tools.
 So literally this book is like the tool that I've been praying for and longing for to just hand to people. It's so easy to hand it to people. Like my part is so easy. You've done the obedience to write it.
 Jesus did all the work. So we're set. So I was at the park and I, there was a single, sorry, not single, a dad, a dad that had comes to the park a lot.
 I see him and we just wave friendly, you know, and he always brings his little girl there and God kept nudging me to tell him you're a good dad. You're a good dad.
 And so I was like, okay, I got to start this conversation. And my daughter praise actually was like, mom, you should give him a book.
 And I was like, I know, I don't know what I was like. Okay. So she confirmed it. And, and I was like, I don't really know what to say.
 And she's like, mom, just say, here's a book for you. Like it'll bless you. It's so simple. So I was like, okay, I got to start this conversation.
 So somehow the conversation started and he shared that he's had moved from Sunset Hills and I was like, oh, do you know about the revival breaking out in LA?
 And then he seemed open. So anyway, at the end of the conversation, I gave him a book and said, you're a good dad.
 And because he always brings his little girl there and I didn't know if he was married or I didn't know, you know, and then a couple days later, five days later, we meet again at the same time.
 And I didn't say anything because God has sort of instructed me not to, you know, check on people. Are you reading the book? You know, like just let, let them say, let them bring it up.
 Let them bring it up. So he comes up to me and shares, by the way, I just want to tell you ever since you gave me that book, something has changed.
 My, yeah, my fiance now wants to buy a Bible and go to church.
 And, and check this out. If for those that saw my testimony, they never opened it and read it. It was just in their house.
 They hadn't read it yet because I was like, oh, did you read it? They're like, he's like, no, we haven't read it.
 She just looked at the title and was like, huh, I don't know if I want to read that.
 But then later she's looking up Bibles online and wants to now go to church with him.
 So, yeah, God is moving through this book. I'm like, OK, God, not that I doubted, but I needed that confirmation just to keep going.
 And I've heard other testimonies like that too. So keep sharing your testimonies because they spur me on, you know, seeing you guys and Diane, the one in the woods.
 Like I was like, OK, and you're you're you're you know what you prophesied last week.
 Like we're picking up speed. It's just clear that God is ready to move. And I'm just I'm just trying to keep up.
 There's there's anointing on the book.
 There's a just like, you know, if a person decides to come, if they will just come into the church, it's like giving God authority, giving him access to then touch because he doesn't force himself.
 Seek and you will find. So even the small action of seeking stepping into the church, maybe you have no idea, maybe you're skeptical.
 But if you can just take that step to seek in that way of stepping into the church, now the power of God can start to touch a person right there and they can become saved.
 They can become set free just because they sought God in that way of just stepping into the church.
 The power of God is moving. So this is so powerful, the tool of this book, actually, because if someone can just accept it, it's like them stepping into the church, you know, because the book carries anointing on it and in it.
 And so they didn't even open it or read it yet, but they could have thrown it away or they could have said no.
 But instead, they said, yes, okay, and I will bring it to my home and place it there, not rejecting it, being open.
 And in this spiritual realm that gave God authority to start to move and is anointing in the house.
 And so where the wife is now thinking about God more and being hungry, Jesus, wow, hallelujah.
 You see how powerful you are in Christ when you be a vessel of him like this in such a simple way.
 Look how powerfully God can use you just handing a book to somebody. That's it. Amen. Hallelujah.
 And Rebecca, I just realized I don't think I've ever had you share here before your testimony.
 Do you want to share why the keys have touched you so much that are in this book?
 What is the freedom transformation you've seen in your life and your families?
 Wow. Okay. I first came into this, found out about your ministry through Pastor Heather and Apostle Larry.
 I was following their church for about three years. And then when Pastor Heather found you, she shared it with me in June, June, almost four years now.
 Yeah. Wow. And I, yeah, so I just, because I trusted Pastor Heather, I was like, okay, like, yes, this is, I have to check this out, you know?
 And so I just, I started just watching online and then eventually I came and just, God just began to move.
 The anointing just began to touch me just so powerfully as I started to learn about surrender.
 And just the things that he set me free from, I'll try to keep it short.
 So I've, I've, I've received deliverance. The first thing that really came off of me was a generational curse of anger and rage.
 I, you know, been a mom for almost 12 years now. And I, that's when I started to notice that I had like triggers because before you can kind of hide it, you know?
 But when you become a mom, like, you cannot hide it. Like, like your buttons are being tested all the time. Your sleep, you know, you're, you're not getting as much sleep.
 And so I just, you know, I started to notice that I had these triggers like, and rage would come out. And, you know, unfortunately, you know, the kids, you know, would, would suffer from it, you know?
 And so, and I didn't want that, you know, I knew that, I knew that wasn't me. I was a believer. And so I would reject it and stand in faith. And I understood God's grace.
 And so I wasn't like living in condemnation, but I just, I didn't want this. I didn't know how to like get rid of it, you know?
 I pray, read my Bible. All those things are taught to do. And so it wasn't until deliverance through the anointing that that broke off of me and has literally changed me as a mom.
 I don't have those triggers anymore. I don't have the frustration. Like I just, I have so much more peace and joy. Just, and just love for my kids. I couldn't get them to come up here, but I love them so much.
 Praise!
 Where is she?
 I'm kind of like with the hat, the young man, the boy with the hat.
 Okay. I'm so touched by praise by, by, hi, hon. I'm so touched by you, by your heart for God, hon. I'm so proud of you.
 Yeah, I know. Maybe they'll come up here one day. But yeah, so that just opened the door for God to start moving in my life and then just applying the teaching and the equipping has just, it's been life changing.
 I'm trying to think of other things that I've been set free from. I mean, pride, so much pride, you know, that's continual, lady surrendering, control, spirit of control, generational control, control, generational curse of control, and just bitterness.
 Just, just, just so much like really like the 19 has touched every single area of my life and to see mostly as a mom, like my life has been completely transformed, but it's even touching my marriage now.
 And as I continue to just surrender and learn to apply what I'm learning, it was really the Lord had to really take me on a journey with this and I'm still on it to just not try to control things and just trust God.
 And I just feel so equipped and so like, I just feel so empowered, you know, through the anointing to just handle any anything that comes my way.
 I'm just so much more on fire for Jesus, like truly experiencing like a zeal, like a renewed passion and a zeal for Jesus that I always wanted, but was starting to get a little stagnant.
 And now that I've encountered the power of God, I just like, I mean, when I first came and started seeing, you know, you move in power and that true grace, I got to see, you know, true grace change, you know, from a preaching church to now a deliverance and healing and the power of God.
 And so for me, I was like, you can't deny the difference.
 I don't know how much more to share.
 Like, just the anointing is tough and my kids, seeing my kids flourish and the anointing, it's made my job as a mother so much easier.
 I don't have the pressure that I have to train them that I have to do the work.
 It's like, just bring them just just let the anointing work and just trust that it's that it's working in their lives.
 Yeah, and it is we're all flourishing.
 Amen. Amen.
 Wow.
 So, on top of all these two amazing testimonies that you shared about with the book this past week, another amazing miracle happened in your family.
 We have a video we're going to play right now of her daughter, praise that you shared on your Instagram page.
 So you can come here so we can get out of the way for the screen and we're going to play the video.
 Glory to God.
 We're just waiting for the testimony. It's coming. It's coming the video. Amen. It's downloading right now.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Well, while we wait, I just want to share.
 I'm so touched by all of your children, how I've seen also the video of them, like praising God in the car.
 They came to a Rise and Shine conference. They came to all the sessions, right? And they were listening. How old are your children?
 Yeah, 11, seven and three. And I brought all of them to Rise and Shine and all of them were touched.
 I was just amazed. I was originally planning to come just by myself and my husband was going to watch the kids.
 And then it turns out I got the weekend wrong. My husband was working. So I was like, well, God has a divine appointment for all of you, all of us.
 And I love bringing the kids. You know, it's more work, but it's worth it.
 And to see the power of God touch them, to see like it was like every mom's desire is to see their kids.
 Like you can't force them to have an encounter. You can't force them to have that fire.
 But to see like them come alive in new ways and just like we were all had so much energy.
 We drove back and forth late nights. You know, we had energy. Everyone was in peace and joy.
 And just afterwards you saw the videos of them praising in the car. My kids are very, you know, you're not going to see them on stage like yet.
 They're coming. But, you know, and so afterwards is at home is when they light up, you know, and just to see the aftermath of that.
 The anointing just touched them was so powerful. So moms, bring your kids. I know it's more work, but bring them, bring them, bring them, bring them under the waterfall, the waterfall of anointing.
 Praise God. So this video, we, I think we have it ready now. So this is of one of her daughters praise.
 Just about was it a day after the conference or? Oh, the video that you're about to see was, yeah, I think it was just like a couple days or maybe one or two days after the conference.
 Yeah, I was in my bed last night and I was talking God and we go to a wise and shine.
 And I learned that in a sermon she said, when the enemy tries to talk to you, you have to say, get behind me, Satan. Shut up, Satan. Get behind me, Satan.
 You have to say, shut up, Satan. So I was in my bed and the enemy was trying to talk to me and I used my authority.
 I said, get behind me, Satan. Shut up, Satan. Have to use your authority to speak. God told me to preach.
 And in the morning after God told me that, I was starting to feel like lines and tongues, stuff and all, stuff and all.
 It just doesn't seem to float when I swallow. And I said to the devil, when you're doing this, I'm going to preach more.
 I'm going to preach more. The enemy was trying to attack and in the morning, said, get behind me, Satan. And I'm going to preach that.
 I am going to preach. I'm going to walk on my authority. I'm going to preach. I'm going to speak good words. I'm not going to speak to you.
 I am not listening to you. I'm going straight on the path. Even if I have lines and tongues, I'm going to preach. God told me to.
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Yes, hallelujah! Wow! Hallelujah!
 You posted that video a couple days ago and it now has 200,000 views on Instagram. It has been shared about 10,000 times.
 And there's more than a thousand comments. And I was looking at them because I just knew this is God behind this.
 This is God. Because you have like 1,800 followers on Instagram.
 400. It went, I mean now I have 1,800. But it was like 400.
 It was 400 followers. So you see, this is only God. Those of you that are on social media and post things, you know this is only God.
 God breathes on that to touch people, to move through her to reach people. And praise, I'm so proud of you.
 You know, God told you to preach that night. You said, God told me to preach.
 And the devil was trying to stop you because he knew how powerful you are. And you preached.
 And a couple hundred thousand people have heard you preach, hon. And they have been blessed and they have been convicted.
 And you have led them closer to God and to be strong and to walk in authority.
 And I am so proud of you. And God is so proud of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 I looked at a lot of the comments because I was so excited. I just knew this was God.
 And I knew the reason it went viral was because God wanted to speak through her to people.
 And the amount of comments of people being convicted was overwhelming.
 Adults, so many adults saying, this convicted me. I needed this word. This strengthened me.
 I'm an adult and she has more faith than me. I'm convicted. You know?
 And so, I thank you, Jesus. Wow. And I'm so proud of you. Praise.
 And I want to say, you are an amazing mom. Yeah, you are an amazing mom.
 And I see God using you in this way to—which, oh my word, it's Mother's Day. God is so prophetic.
 This is so prophetic. Hallelujah. Wow, this is so prophetic. God is using you, I see, prophetically.
 To lead the way, to teach other moms how to be a great mom, how to be a godly mom, how to lead their children to the Lord.
 And he's so proud of you. God is so proud of you. And I see him releasing more anointing upon you to be used mightily by him in greater ways.
 In Jesus' name. And I speak right now that all fear, all timidity would go completely in Jesus' name.
 Anything that was trying to hold you back in any way from being 100% bold like a lion, it must go from your life now in Jesus' name.
 Anything holding you back, it is gone now. Nothing can keep you from soaring, from flying with Jesus.
 I release this anointing to you now. May greater levels of this anointing come upon you.
 And may more of these divine appointments happen. And may many people encounter Jesus' love and power through you and your children in Jesus' name.
 And I release this anointing to the children, to all of the children, to praise and the rest of the children.
 I release this anointing upon you all. May God use you even more powerfully.
 May your light shine so bright and many people your age and beyond be drawn to Jesus through you in Jesus' name.
 Let this boldness increase, the fire increase in Jesus' name. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise God! Praise God!
 Glory to God! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus! Praise God! Praise God!
 Matthew 21, 14 says, The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
 Oh, actually, yep, and he healed them. But when the chief priests and teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did,
 and the children shouting in the temple courts, Hosanna to the son of David, they were indignant, which means angry.
 The chief priests, the Pharisees, the Pharisees were angry at the children praising God.
 Do you hear what these children are saying? They asked him, Jesus. Yes, replied Jesus.
 Have you never read from the lips of children and infants, you, Lord, have called forth your praise?
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! In this time of, in this time of, in this, the context of this scripture is actually right after Palm Sunday.
 And it would have been around the peak of persecution, at the peak of jealousy from the Pharisees.
 Anger, jealousy, and all the nasty words they were throwing at Jesus, false accusations.
 At the peak of this, God used children to praise his name.
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. And you can't, you can't quiet the praises of God. You can't quiet the truth.
 Nobody can quiet the truth about Jesus, the praises of Jesus, the glory to Jesus, and God's work going forward.
 He will call forth children to give praise. He will call forth children to bear fruit, to show the world that this is truly me.
 I remember when I, when I was going through the hardest time of persecution that I had gone through at this point.
 This was in 2022. This was in early March. And I had never faced this kind of persecution in the area of people slandering and saying false accusations and hurtful things that weren't true and people believing them and it being on such a public stage.
 And it was hard. It was not easy. And the Lord gave me so much encouragement in this season.
 One time when I was ministering at an event in Austin, Revival is now Austin, there was a child, I don't know how old she was, I would guess by the handwriting like between eight and 10 or something.
 But I have a letter we're going to put up right now. And so this child gave me this letter after the event was over and it said, Dear Catherine, you are such a great child of God.
 He sent you on this earth for a reason. And you know why is that? It's because he knew you would grow up. You would have a, you would have a mission to deliver people.
 And up above in heaven, Jesus and God are watching you deliver people in such a great way. So what I think when you are saying that you're doing, so what I think they are saying is that you are doing a great job.
 I love you. And I shared that with my spiritual father at the time and my spiritual father said prophetically, he said, you know, there's a verse in the Bible that says,
 If the people won't praise God, he will cause the rocks to cry out praises. Even the rocks will cry out praises. You know, you cannot stop the praises of God and the truth of Jesus moving on the earth today.
 It cannot be quieted. And so he said to me, he said, it's like that. It's like because I was going through so much persecution at that time. And he says, if people won't praise Jesus for what he's doing and also encourage you, you know, stand with you.
 He's causing a child to, to praise what God is doing and encourage you and stand with you. Hallelujah. And prophetically, I see that this is one of the ways that God is splitting the sea in this year of acceptance in any way that the enemy was trying to block the move of God from entering the promised land of acceptance and this revival of God.
 Reaching every area, every space of the world, every place of media and influence and everything. This is one of the ways God is splitting the sea is bearing fruit in this beautiful way of causing praises and causing his anointing and his fruits to move through children.
 To show to the world, to speak to the people who are unsure, doubting, skeptical, like the servant of Elisha who was scared of the army coming against them and didn't see the army that was with Elisha and no down deep that Elisha really was sent by God and that God was with him.
 So this is one of the ways right now that God, you know, with hundreds of thousands of people hearing this word through this young girl. Amen. Is one of the ways that God is proving himself and showing this is me. This is my move. This is my work. These are the fruits. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 So prophetic that her name is praise and this verse verse 16 says, have you never read from the lips of children? Lord have called Lord you Lord have called forth your praise. Hallelujah. A prophetic prophetic name indeed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
 First Corinthians one 26 brothers and sisters think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards. Not many were influential. Not many were of noble birth, but God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
 God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things and the things that are not to nullify the things that are so that no one may boast before him.
 So for God to use a child to speak the truth and be an example of spiritual maturity and strength in the Lord and walking in authority. That's an example of God using weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. So today I titled the message be like like a child. So I'm going to teach you today how to be like a child because it says in Matthew 18 one at that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
 So if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven you have to become like a child.
 And so this is important for you to discover really what being like a child looks like. Amen. Of course this doesn't mean childish. It means being childlike. Hallelujah.
 So I want to share a couple characteristics of children. First off children are simple. They do not have all of this complex knowledge and intellect.
 Human wisdom which is what we just read in this scripture Matthew 18 or I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 1 26 through 29. So he God shows the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
 Now this is not talking about godly wisdom. It's talking about human wisdom. Human wisdom comes from gaining so much knowledge of the world not godly but of the world's.
 Ecclesiastes 1 18 says for in much human wisdom there is much displeasure and exasperation increasing knowledge increases sorrow.
 Now this is not to say that that means we shouldn't go to college. We shouldn't get masters. We shouldn't get our doctorate. We shouldn't become very knowledgeable in your craft or your what God's calling you to you to do as a career or just anything in general like finances and everything.
 No it's not saying that but the thing is that honestly the more knowledge we accumulate there's a big temptation for pride to come in.
 There's a big because that's in that's the the instinct of our human nature is when we've accomplished things that we've risen above other people and we are more important and more special and smarter and deserve more because that one of the biggest human instincts of the flesh that we have to
 reject and be transformed by God in is pride is ego is reputation is that desire for people to approve of us and look at us as special and important and higher above them higher above other people.
 That's an instinct in everybody's human nature that we have to be transformed by God and we do that we have to do that by rejecting the pride and by seeing how that's wrong that we are called to be servants we are called to be the least of these.
 So that's one of the things that God is talking about when he's saying you have to take this lowly position as a child simply because a child doesn't have all of this knowledge and accomplishments they they automatically are not prideful they automatically are in this place of humility.
 And so what we have to do is when we when we gain an age when we even just simply living more years with experience that that is when we have gone to school when we have gone to Bible school or even such accomplishments of reading the entire Bible from front to back anything like this.
 You have to know you have to know that there's going to be a temptation of pride attempt a temptation that you have risen above others that because you have done this because you have studied this because you have gone through these courses you automatically are higher in every level than other people.
 And automatically you have wisdom when honestly it's human wisdom and you could be reading the Bible day and night but you can be like a Pharisee you can be getting you can be not having revelation of the new wine so you can be so knowledgeable about the word you can know you can know all of the different you can know in Greek Latin you can you can know so much about the word of God you can recite the whole Bible.
 You can recite the whole word from the back almost you know you have it memorized but if you didn't have anointed teachings because this is how we are equipped in the body how we are equipped in the church is through teachings through the fivefold ministry anointed teachings that open your eyes to understand the word of God.
 So when you read the word of God on your own you know the revelation you can't read the word of God and really hear God speaking without receiving this anointed equipping from the church.
 This is biblical Ephesians 4 11 through 16 God Jesus sent the Holy Spirit gave gifts to the church apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers and he gave these gifts for the purpose of equipping the body of Christ equipping believers equipping believers spiritually.
 So that you would no longer be immature and deceived by other doctrines of the enemy that the enemy brings but you would be mature and be able to do works of God yourself.
 So a big part of this equipping is equipping in the word of God is equipping in hearing the voice of God is equipping and teaching you what new wine is versus old wine.
 So that's why I say you can't be reading the word of God and really knowing God's true revelation of it if you are not planted in a church receiving anointed teaching that opens up your eyes that releases anointing upon you so you can so your spiritual eyes are open up to to see what God is speaking open opens up your ears to hear what God's speaking.
 Amen. And so there's many people that have gone to Bible school and everything they know the word of God so well but they have never received anointed teaching new wine teaching.
 So they're having a revelation that the Pharisees had of the word of God which was wrong.
 This is what was happening with Jesus. They were attacking him saying you're going against the word of God.
 But he was Jesus was never going against the word of God. He was bringing the true revelation of the word of God.
 He was coming to fulfill the word of God. He wasn't going against it but they were constantly saying you're wrong.
 The word of God says this and you're disobeying it. But really it was God's the word of God says this.
 This is what it's meaning and I am showing you the right way. Amen.
 I'm showing you what God is really speaking in his word.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
 So so children are simple and don't have all this complex knowledge.
 And so as we grow as an adult we have to make that intention to become like a child in this area to reject that pride
 and to be so humbled to know though I have all of this human wisdom knowledge this is nothing.
 I need spiritual knowledge and these are two different things.
 And maybe you know if you've if you're new into the new wine if you're new in the new wine you're a baby spiritually.
 You might have be so learned and have so much Bible school and experience ministering for example.
 But if you're new in the new wine you're a baby in Christ in the area of the new wine which is foundational.
 Amen. So you have to see yourself that way. That's the meaning of being childlike.
 You have to see yourself that way. You have to be willing to step off of your pedestal where people look up to you
 and you have to become like a child teachable ready to learn. Amen.
 Hallelujah.
 Then so this is this is why God uses we can foolish things instead of instead of the human wisdom people.
 He uses we can foolish things so that his simple truth can go forth.
 And the person preaching the person ministering won't get in the way of God's simple truth and simple power.
 Because God's ways are so simple. God's kingdom is so simple.
 How to have victory over the enemy is so simple. How to stay in God's will is so simple.
 How to have relationship with God is so simple. How to receive anointing impartation of anointing is so simple.
 How to receive deliverance is so simple. Everything is so simple honestly.
 God has not made it to become complicated where you have to go through hoops and and everything.
 His principles are simple. His ways are simple.
 And the ones who are childlike enter into the kingdom of heaven quickly because they accept the simple way.
 They accept the simple principles. But the ones who were not childlike to them it seems too simple.
 To the ones who are not childlike and have all of this human wisdom they think that the human wisdom complex way is the better way.
 Because it is the better way in worldly society.
 So there's this stubbornness many times. There's this reluctancy. There's this skepticism towards the simple way.
 A lot of it is pride. They are thinking this is the way. This is how to see deliverance take place.
 This is how to have a relationship with God. And it's this complex religious way.
 And so they don't want to give that up because it means admitting they are wrong and humbling yourself and becoming like a child.
 So an example of this is I remember when God called me to preach. It was very hard for me at first. Public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness.
 I had no idea how to preach. I had no desire to preach and I had no idea how to preach.
 When I would read the Bible I wasn't getting this like what I considered wild revelation.
 When I would read the Bible I wouldn't get this kind of like fire in my spirit that I just wanted to preach what I just heard in the word from God.
 That never happened to me. And so when God was calling me to preach it was difficult for me at first in one regard because I didn't see myself as a preacher.
 I saw preachers a certain way. And one of the ways I saw preachers is being a very advanced communicator in the area of they have a way with words like alliterations.
 They're entertaining, very charismatic, and a lot of intellectual knowledge in their preaching.
 So I didn't have any of that I felt. And I would see people preach and it was like
 They're preaching. And I'm like I don't know how they do that. It was like an art. It felt like. You know what I mean?
 It felt like the opposite of simple. So that was one of the struggles I had where I had to overcome that and reject the lies of the devil when he said you're not a good preacher.
 I would see videos and every time I'd be like they're really good and I'm not like that. But honestly what I was seeing was I was seeing complex and I'm simple.
 And so when I would preach the revelation that God would give me, I would preach just simply. I would honestly just preach like what God had revealed to me, what I had learned that my spiritual father taught me.
 But what God had taught me about the spiritual realm and how to have victory over the enemy and how to be able to surrender to him and how to stay in God's will, how to have relationship with him.
 How to receive anointing. Like these topics I preach. But I would just simply preach like what simply what God had shown me without anything fancy, without any fluff, without alliteration, without any kind of fancy communication skills.
 I don't know if you want to, however you say it. But you know what I'm trying to say? And when I would preach I would think to myself well this was simple and I haven't heard this before so I don't know if this is very good but I don't have anything else.
 And I trust this is what God is having me say. But it was a battle for years where then I would happen to see preachers on Instagram and I'd be like I'm not like that.
 And they're successful. You know they're like big preachers and so I don't know if I'm good enough. I would battle with those feelings all the time when finally the Lord spoke to me.
 You're doing it just as I want it. You're speaking simply. You're speaking my simple truth. You're speaking in a simple way so that even children can understand. And that's how I want it.
 I remember like a year or so before God called me to minister, to preach, I would go to these Bible studies and I can't tell you one thing I learned from there.
 And I'm not exaggerating. I felt so stupid. Don't feel bad. No. I mean I was like the top of my class.
 At one point I was the very number one in terms of, I mean we only had a class of 80 people, but in ninth grade I was at number one in terms of grades that I got.
 So I wasn't used to this. I went in this Bible study and everybody's oohin' and ahin' and it's just over my head, over my head, over my head, over my head.
 It was like another language. Gibberish. It was so much knowledge that was supposed to make you go like wow. You know what I mean? That's what it was.
 And I went there for like a year, like every week. And it just was over my head. It was a waste of time.
 But I'm glad God, it wasn't a waste of time actually, God led me there so I could really understand the importance of the simple word going forth.
 Because that's what people need. People do not need entertainment. They don't need to be wowed by a fancy sermon.
 People don't need to say wow, amen. They need to hear the word of God. They need to understand it. They need to understand how to have a relationship with God.
 They need to understand what the devil's schemes are. They need to know how to be, they need to be equipped to overcome the devil's schemes and attacks in their life.
 It needs to be this simple instruction where every word coming forth, they can understand it. And glory to God, even a young girl can understand it and apply it immediately and then teach 200,000 people in two days.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
 So God spoke that to me and then I became more confident and resting in my calling and thankful that he wasn't, that I wasn't getting all this other fancy stuff because that's not what God wanted.
 And I'm thankful for his grace upon me to not fake things. You know, because I could have done that.
 Especially when I was feeling like I wasn't very good, I could watch somebody else's sermon and like copy what they're saying or their style or something.
 I'm grateful for his grace that I didn't fake anything, but just spoke the simple truth that he revealed to me.
 And it was a walk in faith because our church kept decreasing from 20 people to two people.
 And that was one of over four years before 2021 when revival broke out. And that was one of the lies of the enemy in my mind.
 You know, I never seen like simple preaching like how I did. And so therefore I didn't think it was great.
 You know, I never had seen that. I'd always seen more complex, flashy, fancy kind of preaching.
 And so that's why the enemy would speak to me so much. But I kept rejecting the devil's lies because I chose to believe what God had spoken.
 And then God encouraged me with what I shared with you about how he said, this is what I want you to do. I want you to bring forth this simple word.
 I am simple. This is serious business. The devil is at work. We don't have time to play games and have entertainment to do those things instead of equipping people.
 Instead of opening up people's eyes to know the devil's schemes and overcome him. Hallelujah.
 And so children are simple. And I love like you see how so many comments on that video that I shared of praise.
 People were touched and convicted. It's because they are not these people are not getting the simple anointed word where they are at.
 That's why they are so touched by that simple word that she spoke.
 Hallelujah. And so God's ways are so simple that even a child can understand that even a child can have victory over the devil.
 And so we have to be more simple. We as believers in terms of we have to we have to reject that pride to want to look spiritually important by the revelation.
 God speaks to us by the visions God gave us or something by how we present ourselves as Christians.
 We have to get out of the way and be simple and let God move through us in a simple way rather than trying to look spiritually important and knowledgeable. Amen.
 Amen. Hallelujah.
 We need to get you. You all need to get on the level of the original disciples.
 This is a big reason why Jesus chose the disciples he chose rather than than people who were so knowledgeable in the synagogues so knowledgeable of the Torah.
 They had become so knowledgeable in the old wine way of the word of God. But Jesus needed a fresh a clean slate clean slate.
 He needed disciples who he could who wouldn't be resisting so much. Oh, I know this scripture. Oh, yeah, I know the scripture.
 You know, when Jesus is teaching them. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Jesus, let me let me interject right here.
 God gave me this revelation. Let me share this with you. You know, you know, but would just be simple and like I know nothing.
 I know nothing. Jesus could have chosen people who were learned of the word of God, but it would have required them to really humble themselves to be at a place where they were at the same level of the disciples who were fishermen and tax collectors.
 That takes great humility. And at that time, Jesus saw there was nobody there was no Pharisees. I just see no just like person in the synagogue learning in the synagogue that would be able to humble themselves in that way.
 Now that was in Jesus's time. But now we have the example of Apostle Paul and now we have their example to learn from. So now this can take place today.
 If you are so learned, you can get on the level of the disciples and be a chosen one quickly. It doesn't have to come with a great delay, but it requires a deep surrender.
 It's like you have more to surrender than the weak and foolish ones.
 You have to surrender the pride and the stature and status that the weak and foolish fishermen people of today average your people. They don't have that. They don't got to surrender that.
 It's a deeper surrender. So if you are willing to pay the price, it's there for you to be used mightily by God to be a chosen one. But you have to come to that level.
 Hallelujah. Praise God.
 Matthew 1125. At that time, Jesus prayed this prayer. Oh, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things before I continue.
 Context. The disciples were first sent out to cast out demons for the first time. Jesus sent them out two by two. They come back. They're prayed. They're amazed.
 They're amazed. Jesus demons obeyed us like they obey you. They were so amazed. They tell Jesus. And one of the first things that Jesus does is he praises the Father.
 And he says this right here. Oh, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things, these things as in revelation of the spiritual realm, the keys of the kingdom.
 Passion translation puts it revelation of your authority. Thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever.
 That's what I've been talking about this whole time. And for revealing them to the childlike.
 So if you will humble yourselves and become childlike, the word of God will come forth like the word of God will come forth through your teacher, through your spiritual leader, teaching you the new wine way.
 And you will drink it up. You will be like, yes, I receive. This is the way. And you'll retain it and you'll value it. And in doing so, you become more spiritual.
 Your spiritual eyes have opened up to see in the spiritual realm, to understand the kingdom of God, to understand spiritual things, to understand God's heart, God's character, God's ways, God's principles.
 And when you get to that point, God sees he can trust you with anointing and then he pours anointing upon you. Then demons start to obey you and you start to walk in God's power.
 So that's what happened with the disciples when Jesus is saying, I praise you for hiding these things. The revelation, the new wine revelation.
 And then what happens next is the anointing comes when your people will receive the new wine revelation, when they will receive it as truth.
 And no, this is the way instead of the old religious way, old wine way we used to go. This is the way to cast out demons. This is the way to walk in authority.
 This is the way to be submissive, to be planted, to be submissive to God. This is the way. This is the way to be a disciple. Hallelujah.
 So then more anointing comes. Now you're able to cast out demons and walk in God's power. Amen.
 So the children, they can soak up the word of God and everything else follows from there. These things have been revealed.
 Like how praise, as she shared in that video, did you see how praise spoke with so much conviction?
 So much conviction. It's because these things had been revealed to her because she is childlike.
 There wasn't a question. The enemy couldn't play with her, couldn't lie to her because her eyes had opened up to see the truth.
 But if you are not childlike, if you are prideful, if you are here listening to anointed teaching coming forth, you will be wrestling.
 The pride voice will start speaking and accusing the word of God. Like how the Pharisees accused Jesus' words he would speak.
 Now that doesn't sound right. I don't know about this, but what about this that I've learned in the past?
 And I've learned this from the most scholar people, the most prestigious people. I've learned this. I know this, but this goes against this.
 I don't know. And so there's this debate in your mind. Meanwhile, the childlike are drinking it up.
 But when there's pride, all that knowledge, there's that debate in the mind. It's not a reverence for the word of God, but it's like attacking the word of God is happening.
 And so it keeps you from receiving, which keeps you, keeps your eyes shut.
 And that's the meaning of thanks for, thank you Lord for hiding these things from the, from the wise and proud and only revealing it to the childlike.
 It's like when Jesus says, I can preach this to the Pharisees, but when I preach it, I can preach it, but they won't hear like you guys are hearing to my disciples.
 There's a scripture where he speaks to this. They have eyes, but they don't see. They have ears, but they don't hear.
 So I can preach and preach and preach to them, but they won't receive it. They won't see. They won't hear.
 They won't soak it up because they're not childlike, because they've, they've allowed pride to hinder their eyes from opening, to hinder them from receiving.
 So what do we do? You simply need to humble yourself. That's an action. You need to do what I just shared previously.
 Reject the pride. Realize I know nothing. I empty myself to receive the new wine. I humble myself.
 I, I, I step down from my pedestal and become like the least of these, like a child so that I can enter the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
 Amen. Hallelujah.
 So children, in their minds, they, they are also, they are very simple minded. Like by that I mean, they are humble. They do not have pride.
 They also do not have selfish ambition, ego, manipulation. They don't know how to manipulate. Judgment in their hearts.
 They don't have these things. A child's life is very simple. Eat, sleep, play, and love their parents and their siblings and their friends.
 Right? Very simple life. What if I tell you that our life is supposed to be just as simple?
 We should also eat, sleep, instead of play, although we can play once in a while, but mostly we are serving God, contributing to his kingdom, working for him, and loving God and loving people.
 That's how simple our, our life should be as simple as a child's. We just substitute playing for serving, and we do get to play sometimes too. Amen.
 Okay, but listen to this. This is what many believers do. They say, we are not going to be able to play.
 Okay, but listen to this. This is what many believers do when they listen to the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light, speaking old wine, and leading them into religion.
 Okay, this is what it looks like. Eat, sleep, attempt to achieve approval by serving, wasting time doing religious rituals, making sacrifices God didn't ask you to make that ends up causing you heaviness, pain, no zeal, and a cycle of sin and condemnation.
 So many books, courses, and courses to accumulate knowledge, listening to the devil thinking it's God and continually confused. Therefore,
 I want to read this again. Okay, your life is supposed to be eat, sleep, serve God, love God, love people. Play a little bit.
 Simple, right? This is the religious life that some of you have been living. So complex. Eat, sleep, attempt to achieve approval by serving, wasting time doing religious rituals, making sacrifices that God didn't even ask you to make that ends up causing you heaviness, pain, no zeal, a cycle of sin now and condemnation.
 So many books and courses to accumulate knowledge and listening to the devil thinking it's God making you continually confused. Does that sound familiar to anybody? Their life? Your life is supposed to look like a child's life in terms of simplicity.
 God is so good. He is not in this. He is not in this religious way. He is not in this religious complicated life that's impossible. That's a life with no peace or joy. That's a life not knowing God's love. That's a life that's not productive for the kingdom. That's a life going around in circles in stagnancy. That's a life being led by the enemy blinded like the Pharisees were.
 And so I want to tell you something. If you as a Christian, if you are constantly having this feeling like you like truly in your heart, you want to please God every day of your life. You want to be in his will. Now there's a difference. Luke warm. That's not really their desire. It's like a 50% desire.
 But if it's really your desire to be in God's will each day to serve him, to please him, if that is your heart and you find that you feel like it is impossible to stop sinning, it is impossible to do all that God is asking you to do.
 If you are feeling that way, you are most likely in religion. You are most likely listening to that religious voice of the enemy coming from the enemy, leading you into this complex life where you're going in circles sinning because there's no grace in religion to give you the power and ability to live righteously and pure and holy.
 I'm telling you God is so good. This is one of the biggest reasons. This is one of the biggest reasons why I have so much great joy and peace and abundant life and fruit. Glory to God in my life. One of the biggest reasons is that I live like a child. I live. My life is simple.
 My life in following God is simple. That's how he wants it. It's very simple. God loves you so much. He has amazing plans for you. He has given you his spirit which helps you to do anything. The devil is at work, but greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.
 God has called you to walk in your authority in Christ to reject the devil, to resist his lies in your authority. And when you do, the devil has to flee.
 We are called to simply trust God with all of our hearts. Trust his goodness. Trust his faithfulness. Trust his power. Trust his spirit in our lives. Trust that he will fulfill his promises and trust his word.
 The word of God, the Bible, and the spoken, reima, present tense word coming through the servants of God, the leaders to equip you. Trust that word of God coming forth.
 So this word of God that says resist the devil and he must flee, greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world, that's true. It's truth. There's nothing more true than the word of God.
 I don't care what your feelings are saying to you. The feelings are not greater than the truth of the word of God. Your feelings are lying to you a lot of the time. And lies have no power. The power is in the truth.
 The word of God is the truth. Stand in the word of God. Believe the word of God. Believe I have authority in Christ. Greater is he who is in me than he is in the world. When I resist the devil, he has to flee.
 And God has given me the power to do anything. He has given me an inheritance in Christ of healing, freedom, peace, joy, and abundant life. And he is protecting me.
 That was just like one minute or so I just shared with you pretty much all you need to know.
 I mean, well, all you need to know each day to serve God, to be in his will, to overcome the enemy. One minute. I don't know, or 30 seconds, two minutes, I don't know.
 It's not very complicated. But religion says you got to do all this. You got to do this. You got to do this. You got to do this. And God's not saying to do those things. And you're trying to achieve these things that are impossible to achieve.
 It's outside of God's grace. And you don't match, you don't measure up. I mean, you don't complete them. And then you feel bad, bad, oh, I'm messing up. This is why so many people think it's impossible to live a pure righteous life before God.
 Because they're doing things God didn't ask them to do.
 You're sacrificing things God didn't ask you to sacrifice.
 Like I see the Amish, I took a tour of an Amish country. And I was so grieved because they're trying their best to serve God, to follow God.
 And they think that sacrificing all of these things, TV, social media, clothes, everything, all these different things, is what is pleasing to God.
 But it's the enemy leading them in this way to keep them from having abundant life. You think about how God is using social media and media to reach people by his power.
 And because they're listening to the religious voice, they are missing out on that. You see how that's the devil? You see how religion is the devil? You see how sacrificing is a bad thing sometimes, certain sacrifices?
 We surrender our whole lives, but the religious voice will say, do this, do this, do this. And God's not saying to do that. And it's bringing this heaviness upon your life.
 When your life is really supposed to be this simple, eat, sleep, go to work, be a light to the world, read the Word. Don't get down on yourself if it's a little bit less one day because things happened.
 Bring God into your life every single day. Have intimacy with him throughout your days. Don't measure the words you're speaking in your prayers. He's a real person. Treat him as a real person.
 Stop striving and sacrifice it in these ritual ways. It's taking away the simplicity where God's grace is and where his anointing is and where you can live righteously, purely, and be attractive to the world.
 Meaning people are attracted to your light saying, I want what you have. You're full of peace and joy and abundant life. But religion weighs you down.
 It weighs you down. It keeps you in sin so you're not shining. Hallelujah.
 So you have to be like a child in this way of simplicity, of not making things so complicated in your pursuit of God and following God. Hallelujah.
 Lastly, I want to share children are teachable. They are always growing. They are ready to learn. They want to grow.
 Adults are complacent many times. They think they're good enough as it is. You know when you're in school you're in this mindset of learning and growing, of progressing.
 You want that. You want to get better. You want to grow. You don't want to stay where you're at. That's in your heart and mind as a child.
 I can't wait until when I'm 13. I can't wait until when I'm 18, when I'm a grown up. But then you come to this place of an adult and I'm talking about spiritual growth now.
 As an adult you can lose that mindset that you still need to grow more than ever. And this is so important. You know it's a choice to grow.
 You don't need to stay where you're at. The fleshliness of yourself, selfishness, pride that you have, that does not have to stay there just because that's how you've always been and you feel like that's just how you are and that's how your personality is.
 You don't have to stay there. You need to humble yourself and see that you need to grow. Stop holding yourself back.
 God's power is here to help you grow, but you have to accept it. You have to renew your mind to be like a child and be teachable.
 And see, I need to grow in this area so I'm going to make intention here. I'm going to crucify my flesh here, deny my flesh here.
 Maybe it involves fasting this for a time. Not religiously, but with the leading of the Holy Spirit. I'm going to watch my mouth.
 I'm going to pay attention in areas that I'm immature because you can tell when you say something in a prideful way, when you say something in a selfish way, when you do an action in a manipulative way, you know.
 You know. You know. You know. And Holy Spirit is speaking to you.
 So it's time to respond to that voice convicting you. He's convicting you because you can change, you can grow, but you've got to respond to it and be obedient and come to God and say, I realize I've been selfish in this area.
 I've been prideful in this area. I don't want to be that way anymore. I want to grow. I need to grow. I want to be more like you, Jesus. I need your help.
 And I renounce this. I reject this behavior. I reject the pride in my voice, in my actions. I reject the selfishness, the things I say out of selfishness, the things I do out of selfishness.
 I reject that. I renounce that. Lord, help me to be quiet before, stop speaking before I'm about to speak something out of selfishness or pride.
 Help me to stop and not make the action of pride and selfishness.
 Give me that strength, Lord. And then you make that intention to grow. Like how a child, how a student makes the intention to listen in the school, at class, makes the intention to take notes, makes the intention to study.
 You have to do this in your personal life, in the areas you're not growing in. You need to make intention. Put focus there.
 Respond to God's voice there and make the action to humble yourself, to reject pride, selfishness, or whatever it is. I'm just giving those as an example.
 And that's prophetic because I see that that's one thing that hinders people a lot from growing is selfishness and pride.
 You have the ability and the power to change in that area, to become selfless, to become humble. You have the ability because the Holy Spirit's in you and you're where the anointing is moving.
 Amen. So I urge you, don't get complacent. Don't get prideful. God might have blessed you. He might have brought you to a position or something.
 It's not a stamp of approval that you don't need to grow anymore. You should be diligent in your spiritual life to see the areas that you have been stagnant in, that you haven't addressed, and start growing.
 Start changing. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
 For all the children that are here today, I want to bless you. Could all the children come to the front area or the stage? You can come with your parent if you don't want to come by yourself, but you can come by yourself.
 Can you come up on the stage? Paul, we can remove this.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. You can come all the way over here.
 Everyone can step two steps forward. Yep, there you go.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
 Did you all see that video in the beginning of praise? That video?
 You see how God used her?
 God wants to use all of you like that. He really does. He wants to use every one of you in power, in the anointing.
 He wants to use you through the words you speak. He wants to use you through the love that you show to others.
 The people your own age and even adults, even your parents.
 He wants to use you as a vessel.
 Hallelujah. He really wants to use you. You don't have to wait to be an adult to be used as a vessel by God. Isn't that exciting?
 And I see many people are going to, many children and even adults are going to be led to the Lord, are going to come into revival, are going to receive miracles through you all.
 Yes. Hallelujah. I'm going to bless you all and release this anointing upon you all.
 That God would move through you and touch people. They would experience God's love through you and they would experience God's power through you.
 Amen. Amen. I want to declare right now over every child here, any issue that you're having in your life,
 any way the enemy is trying to work in your life to bring heaviness, anxiety, fear, sadness, any way the enemy is trying to hold you back,
 any way the enemy has come through trauma and abuse, any way the enemy has come through nightmares, I declare it must go from you now in Jesus' name.
 Thank you, Lord. I release this anointing upon you all that you would have great peace and joy and abundant life,
 that you would encounter God's love in new ways, that the fire of the Holy Spirit would come upon you all and God would move through you to touch many people.
 May your light shine so bright, so bright. Let God use these weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world.
 In Jesus' name. And I speak to every child watching, every single child watching.
 And if they're not watching, you're a parent. I release this anointing upon them. And all those words I declare are for them in Jesus' name all over the world.
 Let this light shine through the children. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. I release this anointing upon you.
 Thank you, Jesus. Be filled with the fire of the Holy Spirit. I bless you. I bless you. And I speak healing. I bless you.
 Receive this anointing. Receive more of God's love in your life, peace and joy, blessings, protection.
 Let your light shine so bright. I bless you. Let this anointing increase through you and joy and fire increase in Jesus' name.
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I bless her. I bless you. Thank you, Jesus. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you.
 I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. I bless you. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Children of revival. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
 And I want to speak over every parent here, parent here, moms, dads, every parent who's here, every parent watching online.
 May this anointing come upon your lives in greater ways that you would be an amazing, godly mother and father in Jesus' name.
 Any way the enemy is trying to hold you back from being the best mom and dad, it must be gone from your life now.
 And may your children experience God's love and power so powerfully through you.
 And I speak as the Bible says, train up a child in the ways of the Lord and they will not depart from it.
 May that anointing and grace flow through you that you would train them perfectly led by the Holy Spirit and they would never depart from these ways.
 They would be powerful vessels of God. They would be faithful to the Lord all the days of their lives in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. You all can go back to your seats. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God.
 We are going to give to God right now. We're going to give to God with gratitude, with thanksgiving and praise. Amen.
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
 And God is saying right now that he's wanting you to be more childlike with your giving.
 As children are trusting, children trust that they will be provided for, don't they?
 They never have any fear that they won't get have food. They won't have clothing. They won't have a place to sleep.
 And their parent tells them we're going to do this today. They know they're going to do this today.
 They trust their parents. How much more should we trust our Father to provide for us?
 He sees every seed you sow and he releases a reaping upon these seeds that are greater than the seed you sowed.
 Far greater. This is how you receive more from God. One of the biggest ways is sowing. Hallelujah.
 So as you give right now, may you give with a childlike heart. May you give trusting God fully with expectation. Amen.
 You can lift your seat up or your hand right now. I release this anointing upon every seed, upon every one of you giving.
 May this anointing increase in your life in the area of your finances. May there be more favor upon you.
 And may all of the lack that's trying to come in your life, that's trying to keep creeping back in your life, the lack, it must go from you in Jesus name.
 I speak protection over your finances that the enemy couldn't steal anything. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
 You can bring your seat forward right now and we're going to praise God.
 My God, how great you are.
 My God, how great you are.

 You can stand to your feet right now because now it is time for the power of God to move in this place and bring healing and freedom, breakthrough, any kind of miracle that you need.
 It is time now to receive. Anything is possible right now for everyone here and watching online.
 Lift your faith like a child. Trust God. Believe that he is the miracle worker and his power is real and is here to touch you today, to move through the screen today. Amen.
 I want to encourage you all right now, take a moment with God. Close your eyes. Just take a moment to pray, a moment to speak to God, a moment to surrender.
 Whatever, I know God has spoken to you through the message as well. There's areas where you are not being childlike or he is calling you to be childlike.
 There is areas where you've heard the conviction but haven't responded to it and have not grown and it is time now to respond.
 So speak to God, whatever it is he is leading you to right now and surrender to him with how he's going to move right now.
 However he wants to deliver you, heal you, touch you, just surrender to him for him to do whatever he wants.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. God is bringing healing right now. Thank you Father. Thank you Father.

 I see God touching them just as a centurion soldier came to Jesus believing in healing for his servant. And even though the servant was not there in person, the word of authority touched him and healed him. Thank you, Jesus. I break every generational curse right now off of this family.
 I break every curse off of your sons now and I declare every spirit, tormenting them in the mind, every spirit of lack, every spirit of witchcraft, death. I declare must leave them in Jesus name. I send this anointing to them.
 I call them into the kingdom of God in Jesus name. In Jesus name, I speak protection over them in Jesus name. Thank you, Father. Michael and Samuel. I send this anointing to them now and I speak all the heaviness gone from you off of you now.

 I came in March and you prayed over me. I got diagnosed with stage one breast cancer and it increased in size from 1.4 centimeters to 1.9 centimeters. So I just want to get prayed over because I have to pick lumpectomy or mastectomy.
 And they diagnosed me with Sjogren's syndrome that's going to interfere with the radiation. So I just want to see if I can get prayed over. And this is my sister. I want to see if you can break off her generational curse for any infirmities because she's actually going through something too.
 Yes, yes. And I see there's a key to have you gotten my book yet? I want to advise you to get it. I want to advise you to get it because it's the keys to unlock complete freedom and healing. But here's the key I'm going to share with you right now.
 But I share more of it in the book, but also in my teachings that are on YouTube already, how to receive complete deliverance. But I see a key for your complete healing is to walk in your authority because I see the healing has been released.
 But now it's about seeing it manifest and how you see it manifest is by walking in your authority and rejecting the devil's lies, rejecting the things that are saying otherwise that you aren't healed because God can allow the enemy to attack in this way as a testing of our faith where it's not even bringing sickness, but it's bringing symptoms.
 It's not like this in the spiritual side. It's not there in the physical side. It's there. But in the spiritual side, you are healed. Okay, but God can allow the enemy to make it be there in the physical as a testing of your faith.
 So this is what God is saying to do now. Reject it. Say no, I was healed. I received that prayer that anointing came upon my life. I am like the lepers who didn't see the healing immediately, but on their way they were healed. The Bible says.
 So I must see this full manifestation of healing. All sickness, all cancer must be gone from my body because I am healed. I will go to the x-ray. I will go to the doctors and they will see it's not there. You keep confessing that until you see it.
 That's a key. This is a key. I'm giving you right now. So I want to speak right now that this complete healing must take place. And I speak all cancer and infirmity must go out of your body now in Jesus name.
 All death must go. All fear must go.
 Be healed. Be healed all over your body now. Be healed. I release this anointing to you. I release this anointing. Be healed everywhere now.
 In Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. That's the power of God healing you. Healing you. Hallelujah. Yeah, you are healed. That's right. You are healed. Yes. Hallelujah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to speak right now. Every spirit of infirmity, every spirit of sickness must go from you now. I break every curse and I speak healing to you now in Jesus name.
 Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Praise God. God is touching you right now. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. What is it that you believe in God to do?
 I will renounce for her. I renounce glaucoma. I renounce arthritis. Every spiritual demonic tie. Anything coming against my mom and dad's relationship. Their marriage of over 50 years. Any disbelief.
 Any, just all spirits of infirmity. All premature death. All pride. All religion. And just more increase of faith because she believes. Amen. Amen. I detach you from all of that. I break every generational curse and I declare every spirit attached must go now.
 I speak healing to you now. May this anointing come over every part of your life. Every part of your life. Thank you Jesus. In your marriage. In your body. Everywhere. May you flourish and have abundance. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Father.

 And I speak that this week you would become more humble and childlike. You would enter into the
 simple ways of Jesus, the simple ways of his kingdom, and you would exit out of the complexity
 of the religious life. You would, you would exit out of the heaviness of religiousness,
 but you would, like a child, enter the kingdom of heaven with simplicity, the simplicity of the
 Father's heart towards you, the simplicity of his great love for you. May your eyes see his great
 love for you more, the simplicity of his love for you and his plans for your life and his thoughts
 about you. He simply loves you so much. He simply cares for you so much. He simply has the best plans
 for you. Simply, simply, simply, he's just that good. There's no, there's nothing more to it.
 There's no other motives or something. There's no other hard things you have to do to achieve this
 love. He simply loves you so much. Let your eyes open up to this truth and may the love of God fill
 you in new levels. May you experience more of his love this week. May you experience more intimacy
 this week. May you experience more of this precious relationship with him and may this
 great love overflow out of you and touch everyone around you. All the ways of pride that have been
 keeping you held back, may they be gone from your life and may with humility you enter into new areas
 of the kingdom of heaven. May you enter deeper, like in the holiest of holies. May you go deeper
 this week as you humble yourself more and become more like a child. In Jesus name. Thank you, Jesus.
