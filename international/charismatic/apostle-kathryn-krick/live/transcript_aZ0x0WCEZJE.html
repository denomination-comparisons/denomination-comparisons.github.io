small group that's not very very close to you, you can still join the one that's the closest to you. I believe we
29:27
have 40 plus small groups right now with small group leaders under the mentorship
29:33
and the leading of Apostle Katherine who host these gatherings for people who are
29:38
not able to be here every Sunday in Los Angeles. It's a time of fellowship. It's
29:44

people who want to know what God is doing global. Hallelujah. It's a beautiful time of community, a beautiful
29:56
time of growth and equipping. And uh there's also a Spanishspeaking small
30:02
group for those who live in the United States who speak Spanish. So you can join that. You could go to the
30:07
5fchurch.org/sallgroups and join that if you speak Spanish. Amen. And we have small groups for
30:14
people who live in Northern California and are not able to make it here. Small groups for people in San Diego, small
30:20
groups literally in many states and many nations as well. So like say if you
30:25
speak French but you don't live in France, you can join that small group. Amen. This is just such a beautiful
30:32
opportunity and it it's the the whole world is going to catch on fire. You know that, right? The whole world is
30:39
going to catch on fire with this revival. Amen. Hallelujah. So, we just
30:44
encourage you to join those small groups if you're not able to come here to Los Angeles and be in person at 5F Church
30:50
every Sunday. We have five Furch flyers available in the lobby for you. Grab
30:57
some of those flyers. Pass them out this week. Drop them off at the bookstore. Drop them off at work. Drop them in the
31:04
break room. Drop them off wherever you go. Leave them in the bathroom, wherever. God will show you. He'll put
31:10
it into the right hands. And people will come as they use, they see this flyer.
31:15
They're not used to seeing flyers like this. This is a flyer that says, "You need a miracle 5F Church QR code." As
31:21
soon as they run that QR code on their phone, they're brought to the website and boom, there goes the explosion.
31:27
There goes the revival in their life. Amen. And you got to be part of it. So, grab some flyers on your way out. Amen.

Welcome home. Nicole is one of our small group leaders

40:10
And I would love for you to share your testimony and also share with us about the small group that's reaching beyond
40:16
Illinois. Illinois and beyond. Yeah. Praise God. Okay. So, um it's pretty powerful
40:23
actually. I'll try to share a very brief synopsis of my testimony. However, I don't know
40:29
how to do that because the miracles God have done since coming to 5F have been so big. Um but it it was pretty
40:36
powerful. Actually the this morning I so I journaled different events throughout
40:42
my journey and I even journaled prior to coming to 5F church in two finding it in
40:47
2022. And so actually I found on my journal that on this exact day three
40:55
years ago I wrote a question to myself and that question was how do I come under the covering of 5F Church and the
41:01
anointing? And so, uh, fast forward just a couple weeks and on September 13th, I wrote
41:08
this is the day. September 13th, 2022 is the day where Apostle Katherine became
41:14
my spiritual mom and covering. So, so powerful. Um, prior to coming to
41:21
5F Church, Sure. Prior to coming to 5F Church in May of 2022, I had really resurrected my
41:29
heart to God. And I was on fire and hungry. And in that hunger, that's when God led me to 5F a year and a half
41:36
later. And in that year and a half of hunger, I saw it and saw it and saw it and sought God. I sought him through
41:42
different teachings online, through different books. I think I was reading 10 different books at one time. I was so
41:48
hungry. But I wasn't changing. I wasn't having much change. I had a little bit,
41:54
but I wasn't having much change. And so, somebody actually mentioned to me just
41:59
in passing about Apostle Katherine, and at that time, I didn't look her up right away. Um, I was on a social media fast,
42:07
but as I got back onto social media, the first thing I remembered was you. And
42:12
so, I looked up Apostle Katherine. And in my hunger, the first video I looked up was the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
42:18
And so right away um I saw something was different at 5F. I couldn't pinpoint it
42:24
at that time. I was you know there was so many areas of oppression even in my
42:29
hunger and fire for God in that year and a half. I was oppressed. I had so much
42:34
oppression as a Christian on fire for God. I was bound by so many different things. Condemnation, religion, being
42:41
led by the angel of light, rejection, fear of man, fear of authority. I mean the list goes on and on and on. And when
42:48
I found 5F Church in May of 2022, I didn't know that you could be planted online. In fact, God had I already felt
42:56
that God had led me out of my previous church. But I was searching I was searching around locally for a local
43:02
church and started watching Apostle Katherine online. And that which was what led up to that question. But once I
43:09
found out that you could be planted online, that that's a spiritual principle, that you could have a spiritual parent, I became planted. And
43:15
my life's never been the same. Truly, it's never been the same. And so, um, so
43:21
many different miracles. Um, I I actually wrote a couple things down, but
43:27
one thing that I wanted to share that's so important, one of the teachings here that I love so much is these teachings
43:35
actually change and transform your life. If you if you listen to them and you work on it within you, they actually
43:42
change your life. And based on me and based on my history, there was a lot of
43:47
trauma in my background. And so the enemy would influence my emotions so much. And I always looked, I even looked
43:53
at God wrongly. It wasn't until I came to the anointing that I saw God accurately. But because of the different
44:00
trauma, I could either numb myself or I was over emotional. I had no control over my emotions a lot of time. And I
44:06
just thought that's who I was. And so when I started learning about the power of God and the enemy can come in and
44:13
influence our emotions and our thoughts and our actions and our behaviors, that was crazy. That was so crazy. And it
44:20
started to transform me little by little. And I remember one other thing I want to share powerfully and then I'll
44:26
share about small groups. But um when I first came to the um when I first found
44:32
5F Church, I had no idea that the angel I I I had heard about the angel of light, but I had no idea how the angel
44:39
of light operated or operated in my life. And in that hunger, in that time
44:44
frame, kind of similar to your story, I saw so many people that seemed so much
44:50
more spiritual than me. They were on fire. They could hear God. They could speak prophetic words. And it made me
44:56
feel so small. And on top of that, growing up in religion around Pharisee
45:01
spirit, not only did I feel so small, but I looked at God as this condemning guy who was always judging or condemning
45:08
everything I did. And so I couldn't see God's love accurately. And so, um, fast
45:13
forward a little bit and I remember right before I found 5F Church, I came
45:19
across a te a teaching and just in my childlike learning, this teaching was
45:25
um, you can anything that you that comes to your mind that's free
45:31
flowing, you write that down on a piece of paper and that's God speaking to you. And so, that became my false doctrine in
45:36
that time frame. And I was like, wow, thank you, God. Finally, I can hear from you. And then I felt like I was finally
45:41
growing spiritually. And so when I came to 5F Church, that was the doctrine that I had came with. And it took a while for
45:48
me to realize that that wasn't all God. But God was patient and slow. And through the teachings and through being
45:54
planted, planted was being planted was a serious thing. It completely transformed my life and set me free. And I stand
46:01
here free today. And so one thing I've really seen God do that's the most
46:07
incredible thing is put inside me a heart for the kingdom. He took out self- glory. He took out self things that I
46:14
wanted to achieve for myself. And he put in this heart where I truly come to him. And even if I'm still growing in that
46:20
area, I come to him and I say, "How I want to serve your kingdom today. How can I serve your kingdom today?" And I
46:25
make it my intention. And the more I make it my intention and the more I put that into practice, the more God grows me. So, it's just been powerful. It's so
46:33
powerful. I honor you. Truly, I honor you. I honor the anointing. It literally you need the you need the anointing. You
46:41
cannot grow. I I didn't even know what an apostle I heard apostle in the Bible, but I was clueless as to what an apostle
46:48
was, nor did I ever think I needed an apostle. Now, I can't be without an apostle. Um so but um as far as small
46:56
groups, it's so as far as small groups, it's so powerful
47:01
what God is doing. It's truly I remember feeling like a lone ranger for so long
47:06
in my city. Like where's all the people? How come no one is interested in hearing, you know? And now God has moved
47:13
it several years later from that yearning in my heart to see people just really on fire for God, love God,
47:20
wanting to be equipped. My small group members are doing different things, passing out books, passing out flyers.
47:25
They're testifying how they feel so much peace at 5F Church and then come to the small group and that peace flows
47:31
through. They're feeling peace after they leave the small groups. They're testifying that the teachings that are shared, sometimes we share teachings,
47:37
are exactly the teachings they need. It's just powerful what God is doing. And the most powerful thing with small
47:42
groups and God has blessed our small group. We have right now five different states that attend regularly. We have
47:50
Illinois, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
47:56
Um so we have five states out of the Midwest and two more states that have
48:02
signed up. Um where God is just bringing together his body collectively to just
48:08
step out as warriors in the kingdom. step out. So yeah, praise God.
48:14
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for having a heart for
48:22
the people in your area of the of the country in the Midwest. God is proud of
48:29
you and he's using you powerfully and he has such great plans to use you mightily
48:34
in this anointing. Thank you, Jesus. Is there catchers around, ever? Okay,
48:42
I speak right now healing to your body completely. That any issue in your body
48:47
must go in Jesus' name now. Total healing I declare from now in your
48:53
entire body in Jesus' name. And I release more of this anointing to you in
48:59
Jesus' name. May the fire of the Holy Spirit fill you more. And may this fire
49:06
spread mightily in Illinois and all of these states and beyond. May this fire
49:12
pour into all of the people attending the small groups. And may revival grow
49:17
in Illinois and the Midwest in Jesus name.
49:23
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
49:28
Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to
49:34
God. I want to encourage you, those of you
49:39
watching online, if you're wherever you are in the world, if you're not in the SoCal area and you can't come here in
49:46
person regularly, join a small group. What God is doing in these small groups
49:51
is so powerful. There are so many miracles happening every week. I'm sharing the testimonies on my story on
49:58
Instagram, on Facebook. You can see them. And this these small groups,
50:03
what's what what God is doing is he's honoring this obedience to put him first. He's honoring this obedience to
50:11
see revival spread in your area of the world. Cuz that's a big purpose of what God is doing in these small groups is is
50:18
is is you know when we put one, two, three flames together, that fire starts
50:24
to burn. four 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 that fire begins to spread and spread
50:30
and spread. God is about unity. That's a key to revival spreading is unity. And
50:35
so just the action of being obedient to unite together with the fellow revival
50:42
warriors in your area of the world, God is going to move powerfully upon
50:48
this obedience and make revival to spread wildly in your city and nation.
50:53
And not just that, but he rewards those who are faithful, who are obedient to him. So there's a great reward that
51:00
comes just by being obedient in this way to join these small groups. Amen.
51:06
Hallelujah. And and and and very soon we'll have to start calling them big groups.
51:13
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Well, we are
Message
51:20
going to get into the word of God right now. Oh, by the way, if you want to join a small group, go to the link in my bio or 5fchurch.org/s
51:27
smallgroups. You can join the nearest one near you. There's there's 40 of them, so we don't
51:33
have them in every nation or every state yet, but you can join the nearest one near you. So, we're going to get in the word of God right now. And um I'm
51:41
titling this message Accessing God's Best.
51:47
Accessing God's Best. Hallelujah. So Jeremiah 29:11,
51:58
for I know the plans and thoughts that I have for you, says the Lord.
52:04
Plans for peace and well-being and not for disaster to give you a future and a
52:12
hope. I'm going to read the Passion translation of this. Here's what Yahweh says to you. I know all about the
52:19
marvelous destiny I have in store for you. A future planned out in detail. My
52:26
intention is not to harm you, but to surround you with peace and prosperity
52:33
and to give you a beautiful future glistening with hope.
52:38
Amen. Hallelujah.
52:43
God's plans for you are amazing. incredible, marvelous, beautiful,
52:50
beyond your wildest dreams. This is the plans God has for you, for
52:57
every single one of you. This is not something nice to say. This is not just a familiar Bible verse that most people
53:04
know, but this is the word of God. This is the promise for your life that God
53:11
has such incredible and beautiful plans.
53:17
Your future is glistening with hope. Your future is way better than your
53:23
past. Even though your past by and large, maybe it has been beautiful, maybe it has not, but for some for some
53:29
of you it's been amazing. It's been beautiful. It's hard to imagine it could get better. Maybe for some of you, God's
53:35
plans is that it would get even better. Our God is a God who takes us glory to glory.
53:42
That is our God. Hallelujah. And he is a God who rewards
53:49
rewards you when you obey him. Um
53:57
the the the the the plans that God has for you are so amazing. First of all, your this
54:05
is what your future looks like. It looks like harvest coming from the seeds that you planted. It says in uh Galatians
54:12
6:9, "Let us not become weary and doing good. For at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
54:22
If you do not give up, you for sure will reap a harvest. So part of the reason,
54:29
part of what your future looks like and part of why it's so beautiful is that there is a harvest coming that is
54:35
currently not here. And sewing and reaping a harvest are totally opposite.
54:42
like the the the the the the joy, the enjoying, the satisfaction,
54:49
the the the beauty of the harvest is so different than the toil
54:56
of the sewing and the not seeing anything yet because
55:01
you put the seed in the ground and it's not harvest time yet so you see nothing. It's so different. There is harvest
55:09
ahead. And if you have been, some of you have been sewing for in some area. Some of you have been sewing in another area.
55:15
Some of you have been sewing in another area. Maybe you sew in relationships in your
55:20
family. You are sewing in your service to God. You were sewing in your
55:26
relationship to God. You're sewing in different areas. You're sewing in the workplace. You're sewing in you're
55:32
sewing in in in your studies. You are doing everything in your studies or in your job or as you pursue a business,
55:39
whatever God's leading you to do with your job. You are putting in work. You
55:45
are sewing seeds and you're going to reap a harvest someday. Someday that business is going to take
55:51
off. Someday that promotion is going to come
55:56
because you've been working with your whole heart as if it as as doing it for the Lord as worship. So, so when you
56:04
when you sew, God is calling you to sew in all these different areas. He's calling you to sew in all different
56:10
areas of your life. So, if you're sewing in all these different areas, guess what that means? Not just one harvest is
56:16
coming up in the future. Not just one glorious harvest, but a lot of harvests are coming up.
56:25
And so what when you first surrender to God,
56:31
it's it's a whole lot of sewing and no reaping yet. It's a whole lot of sewing. And many
56:38
believers stop short. They give up. The bi the verse says
56:44
you'll reap a harvest if you do if you do not give up. But but but but some many believers give
56:50
into the temptation of the enemy. The enemy doesn't want you to reap. The enemy doesn't want you to
56:56
experience the abundant life that God has for you. Because when you start experiencing abundant life, that's when
57:02
you shine the brightest. That's when you've conquered the devil and your eyes are fully open to see how
57:08
good God is. Because our life is a journey of our eyes opening up more and more to see the goodness of God. But I'm
57:14
telling you, once you taste more of the goodness, once you taste a promise being fulfilled, it's it's a way your eyes
57:20
open up like you can't experience. And so the devil can't fool you anymore.
57:26
He cannot fool you anymore. So he can he can work hard sometimes in the sewing
57:31
seasons. And many believers, they give up. Many
57:37
believers stop short before they see the harvest. and they are missing out on the
57:42
glorious, abundant life that God has for them. The plans God has for you are so great
57:48
because you're going to see harvest upon harvest. You're going to see desires of
57:53
your heart being fulfilled. That's going to be part of the harvesting harvest, the reaping from your sewing.
58:00
And the more you serve God day after day, the more God can entrust you with
58:06
more responsibility for his kingdom, more influence for his kingdom, more anointing. And that all translates to
58:12
being used even more powerfully by God to touch people. And there's no joy like
58:18
that in the world. is is walking in your purpose and seeing
58:25
lives changed, be brought closer to Jesus, eyes open up to his love, set
58:30
free and healed. There is no greater joy.
58:36
That's in the future. That's what's to come. Hallelujah.
58:44
and and also what's to come in the future is transformation to be more like
58:51
Jesus. And that is the ultimate joy because the
58:57
more you're transformed into the in the image of God, the devil can't lie to you anymore because you fully have the mind
59:04
of Christ. You think like Jesus. You
59:10
You think like Jesus. You see like Jesus. You feel like Jesus. You act like
59:17
Jesus. And when that happens, no doors being open to the devil. And you're just
59:23
soaring in the protection of God, the peace of God, the abundant life of God.
59:28
You are soaring. That's the greatest joy to be
59:34
transformed into the image of God more when you don't worry about anything. I was thinking about today how much more
59:40
peaceful my life has become just by being transformed more into the image of God by going through trials and allowing
59:46
God to mold me through the trials. The big thing is getting more faith
59:54
and getting all the selfishness out. Um I I was thinking just like when
1:00:02
attacks used to come, persecution used to come, I would feel the feelings of worry. I would feel the feelings of of
1:00:09
stress. It was like, "Oh, this is horrible to have to go through, you know, but but
1:00:15
now I don't fear the future. It when persecution happens, doesn't
1:00:21
rattle me because my faith has grown because I've grown more to be like God, to be more
1:00:28
like Jesus in terms of faith, in terms of selflessness." So, okay. Well, this
1:00:35
persecution that happened means that um you know, I'm thrown in the pit or something instead of stepping into the
1:00:42
promised land yet. Well, that's okay because the promised land is coming in God's perfect timing and God's going to
1:00:48
do something purposeful in this pit. You know, situations like this where before
1:00:55
it was like, "Oh, I'm in the pit. This is awful. I thought we were going to the
1:01:00
promised land." Now it's just peaceful because the selfishness is gone.
1:01:06
And it's just like God have your way. I just want God's will. So whether it's
1:01:12
the pit or the promised land, that's where I want to be. If that's God's timing to be pit or the promised land, I
1:01:18
want to be in God's will only. So that's where the only place I'm happy, you know? Yeah. So that that's not
1:01:24
immediate. That comes as you continually obey God, walk in surrender every day.
1:01:31
Every day you do that, he literally transforms you to be more like him every single day. And one day you'll wake up
1:01:37
like me and be like, "Whoa, the world is more beautiful.
1:01:43
There's nothing to worry about. I have nothing but peace and joy. This
1:01:48
life is so beautiful. It's not overnight, though.
1:01:54
This is the future you have to believe in and obey God every day until you get
1:02:00
you can have peace and joy always. I'm but I'm saying like the the future that's ahead is even is is beyond what
1:02:07
you can imagine. Is beyond what you can imagine. I'm telling you
1:02:13
I I'm in awe of the life that I'm living of the plans that God had for my life.
1:02:20
They are better than my plans. God's plans have been and are way better than
1:02:27
my plans. I had plans. I had dreams. God had different dreams and different
1:02:32
plans. And I'm so glad, so relieved I
1:02:37
chose God's plans and dreams over mine because they are so
1:02:43
much better. They equal so much more peace, joy,
1:02:49
contentment. They equal so much more transformation to be more like Jesus. And they equal walking in purpose
1:02:57
and changing the world and being a mighty vessel of God.
1:03:04
That's what God's plans and dreams equal. And there's no way that you're going to
1:03:11
have the same exact plan and dream as God in every area of your life.
1:03:17
There's going to be times where God will confound you and say this way instead.
1:03:23
But I'm telling you, it's better. It's so much better. And one thing I've learned with God is that
1:03:31
we think we know best. We don't. We really don't.
1:03:39
You think your dreams, your plans are the best.
1:03:46
You think that this has to be it. You have to do this. This is where you will
1:03:52
experience contentment and joy. But you won't. Only in God's dreams and plans does that
1:03:59
happen. And you know, there's so much that I've had to sacrifice and I continue to
1:04:05
sacrifice now. I've had to sacrifice my dreams. I wanted to be u married and
1:04:10
having children by mid20s. I'm approaching 35 now.
1:04:17
And um I had to give up God's timeline um for that for those dreams. And that
1:04:23
was my biggest dream. And um never could I imagine that like
1:04:28
since that was my biggest dream that living without that dream would be
1:04:35
better than what I imagine the joy I would experience in that dream.
1:04:43
I've learned that we think we know what we want, but we don't.
1:04:49
You think you know what you want, but you don't. Now, delight in the Lord and he will
1:04:55
give you the desires of your heart. There are many things that come from God that literally come from God that he wants you to desire and he'll give it to
1:05:02
you. But there's other things that you are very stubborn about in your heart that
1:05:09
you want that actually isn't God's plan or the timeline is far from God's
1:05:16
timeline. This takes humility, by the way. This
1:05:21
takes real humility. to take a chance on God's plans and dreams
1:05:30
and give up yours. But I encourage you to do it. It's the best decision you'll ever do. Do do is
1:05:37
surrender fully to God and just trust him. Adopt his dreams. Adopt his plans.
1:05:44
Put yours aside. You can trust him. He knows best for your life.
1:05:53
He knows the plans he has for you. The intricate details. He knows.
1:06:01
Hallelujah.
1:06:10
James 1:12 says, "God will bless you."
1:06:15
God will bless you. He will give you such a great future. He will give you so so many blessings upon
1:06:22
your life. He will give you if
1:06:28
if you don't give up when your faith is being tested.
1:06:35
If you don't give up when your faith is being tested, he will reward you with a glorious life
1:06:46
just as he rewards everyone who loves him.
1:06:53
God rewards everyone who loves him.
1:07:02
He rewards everyone who loves him.
1:07:09
There's a lot of believers who say they love God
1:07:14
but are not showing their love to God with actions.
1:07:21
And that's what tells it all. That's what God counts as, "Do you love me?
1:07:29
Like Jesus said to Peter, "Do you love me?" "Yes." "Then feed my sheep. If you
1:07:36
love me, you will do this action.
1:07:45
Delight in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart." When you delight in the Lord, he will then give
1:07:51
you the desires of your art heart. Not all Christians delight in the Lord,
1:08:00
meaning go after his heart,
1:08:05
but many read his word, sing praises to God, attend church, serve in the church,
1:08:12
talk about God, but don't delight
1:08:17
in the Lord. And they are missing out on the abundant life. They are missing out on the abundant life. I'm telling you
1:08:24
that I am living an abundant life that I could never imagine of such peace and
1:08:31
such joy. Dreams fulfilled, desires of my heart
1:08:36
fulfilled. And so much of this abundant life and
1:08:42
desires of my heart fulfilled. This abundant life is in every area of my life, by the way. Every section of life,
1:08:48
part of life. But that didn't come immediately. The peace of Jesus, the joy
1:08:56
that comes with intimacy with God, that came immediately. Hallelujah.
1:09:02
But the desires of my heart and abundant life in every area did not
1:09:08
come immediately. For me, it took four and a half years after I surrendered to Jesus fully and
1:09:17
received my calling and started walking in my calling. And then after the four and a half
1:09:22
years, all of a sudden it was harvest. And all of a sudden, I started seeing that all the seeds that I swed,
1:09:30
it's like there was a harvest one day and then there was a harvest of different fruit the next day. Glory to
1:09:37
God. And there's a harvest of fruit the next day. And there's a harvest of fruit the next day. Four and a half years. God
1:09:44
counts every seed. Every seed must produce a harvest. Imagine if you obey God every single day for years. That
1:09:52
doesn't equal just one day of harvest. It's harvest every day because you keep on sewing God. So in the beginning, it's
1:09:59
sewing, sewing, sewing, nothing, nothing, nothing. God stretches you. God tests you. God will pull really stretch
1:10:05
you sometimes for years not see any harvest. But then the harvest comes and it never stops.
1:10:12
[Applause]
1:10:19
That's what I experienced. And like with this revival breaking out, my heart burned for revival. My heart burned for
1:10:24
people to experience God's power. And for four and a half years, it was just very small. A couple would come, a
1:10:31
handful would come to our church and we would we would see God move in power from time to time, but not like now like deliverance and healing happening,
1:10:38
impartation of anointing, not like that, but we would see the prophetic touch people and sometimes people fall back
1:10:44
with God's power, sometimes being baptized in the Holy Spirit, but it was just a couple. And now it's like literally every day we're living in
1:10:51
revival. Literally every day there's testimonies flooding in that just bring a smile to my face and cause me to just
1:10:58
have to praise God and thank God. Every single day I'm seeing people be
1:11:04
touched by God's power and God do miracles in their life. But that was four and a half years of not really
1:11:09
seeing any of that hardly and hungering for it. Hungering, hungering.
1:11:16
Now it's every day for years and God adds more.
1:11:21
The har the harvest gets bigger. The fields expand of the fruits. Glory to
1:11:27
God. The anointing increases. God opens up more doors.
1:11:34
Hallelujah.
1:11:40
But I I feel this burden in my heart with this word today because what tends
1:11:46
to happen so often when people look at ministers and people look at ministers with the anointing when people and when
1:11:52
people look at anybody with any kind of success or whatever they put them on a pedestal.
1:11:59
I don't mean so much well and I'm not even talking about like
1:12:04
a worship but I mean they separate themselves from them meaning like I
1:12:10
can't have that
1:12:15
they just have a special favor on their life but I can't have that
1:12:21
they don't make that connection that ministers ministers who carry the
1:12:27
anointing and Even we can go even just general success is is to be a s is to be
1:12:33
an example an inspiration for you is to be able to see look this is what's
1:12:39
possible when you give your life fully to Jesus this is what's possible if you do not
1:12:46
get weary in doing good and you do not give up you will reap a harvest
1:12:55
this can happen in your life too. I feel the love of God for every single
1:13:00
one of you. I'm telling you, I feel this so strongly in my heart. God speaking
1:13:05
this, that he has such amazing plans for every single one of you.
1:13:13
That what he did in my life would happen in your life. Not in the exact same way,
1:13:19
but that you would have the same testimony that I just shared. That you
1:13:24
are experiencing abundant life in every area. That you are
1:13:30
that you are experiencing the desires of your heart being full fulfilled. that
1:13:35
you are experiencing dreams come true and even better God's dreams that you didn't even want but are finding more
1:13:43
joy in those dreams than the joy you imagine you'd have with your dreams
1:13:51
that you would see a continual harvest in your life that you would see yourself transformed more into the image of God
1:13:58
that you would see God use you mightily in the anointing I believe with all of my heart that this is God's plan for
1:14:05
your for you to have this same testimony that I just shared.
1:14:16
There was a time when I I was lukewarm. There was a time when I was pursuing
1:14:23
being a singer. There was a time when I had such little money and I needed to
1:14:29
rely on my parents. They graciously helped me financially for years.
1:14:35
There was a time I didn't know what to do with my life. There was a time I was trying so many things, going to college
1:14:41
for something, communications, trying all these different pursuits of a career and not finding what my purpose was.
1:14:48
There was a time I was convinced my calling was to be a singer for a year and a half and things were going well,
1:14:53
but not actual success. Just the music video and the songs came out good.
1:14:59
But there was a time where I looked nothing like I do now. where my life
1:15:04
looks nothing like it does now. And I just share that because if you,
1:15:11
you know, are not experiencing abundant life in every area, if you are not experiencing the desires of your heart
1:15:18
being fulfilled yet, I was once there.
1:15:23
God wants to do what he's done in my life, in your life.
1:15:30
I I I feel the love of God, the urgency of God for you to know this word right
1:15:35
now. Hallelujah.
1:15:41
When you surrender your whole life to Jesus and accept him in all of his ways,
1:15:48
this is like the biggest secret in the world is just like the supernatural life that God will give you when you
1:15:54
surrender your whole life to Jesus. the supernatural protection, the supernatural peace. It doesn't make
1:16:00
sense in every circumstance. The supernatural joy, the supernatural financial blessings,
1:16:09
the supernatural doors that God opens, the supernatural ways he transforms you. He gives you gifts you never even had
1:16:15
before. The supernatural ways he gives you success for his glory.
1:16:24
the supernatural way he he he he builds such beauty and love and relationships you can never imagine to have
1:16:31
this is the biggest secret the most that the world doesn't know many believers
1:16:36
don't know because people many believers are not
1:16:43
surrendering everything you have to surrender everything you have to actually delight in the Lord
1:16:49
Amen. Delight and then he gives you desires of
1:16:55
your heart. Love the Lord. Actually love him.
1:17:01
Actually love him. Disobedience is not loving him.
1:17:12
Having pride is not loving him.
1:17:17
Surrendering 99% is not loving him.
1:17:26
We're called to love him with all of our all our heart, all our mind, all our
1:17:32
strength. That's love. We're not called to like God like God a
1:17:38
lot. We're called to love him.
1:17:47
like a husband and wife. They're not called to like each other a lot, are
1:17:52
they? They're called to love.
1:17:58
The the the the the groom lays down his life for her
1:18:06
and the the the the bride submits herself to him.
1:18:13
That's love. That's love.
1:18:21
There's one big thing I want people to know if they ever see my life, if they ever see like
1:18:27
how I'm blessed and experiencing revival and the anointing and everything.
1:18:34
It's not random. It's not by chance. It's not cuz I'm
1:18:39
lucky. It's not cuz I have extra special favor I was born with or something.
1:18:45
It's not like winning the lottery or something. There's a reason
1:18:51
because I love God.
1:18:57
I made the decision to love God with my life, with my obedience,
1:19:04
with my surrender, with humility.
1:19:12
And this and and and and and one one big thing I want the world to I want people
1:19:17
to know is you can have this too. You can have this too.
1:19:24
Many are called, few are chosen. Few want to surrender, though. I urge you to
1:19:29
surrender. Oh, is it worth it? It is worth It is worth it.
1:19:36
But you have to believe cuz it doesn't feel like it's worth it at first
1:19:42
when you're sewing and sewing and sewing and not seeing the reward yet. You have to believe God
1:19:49
and you have to choose to deny yourself. Deny your selfish desires.
1:19:58
We can define loving God by faith,
1:20:06
obedience, and humility.
1:20:11
We can define loving God by faith, obedience, and humility.
1:20:18
Yes.
1:20:26
James 1:6 when but when you ask you must believe and not doubt.
1:20:34
When you ask God for something you must believe and not doubt because the one who doubts
1:20:40
is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind.
1:20:48
That person should not expect to receive anything
1:20:54
from the Lord. Such a person is double-minded and
1:20:59
unstable in all they do. We learned about faith last week.
1:21:06
Are you valuing faith? Are you seeing how important faith is
1:21:12
when you doubt that person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord? So a lot of people, a lot of
1:21:18
Christians are missing out on abundant life. They are not receiving the supernatural life that God has planned
1:21:25
for them because they are doubting.
1:21:30
God goes by principle. When you love him, he pours out all these blessings. He rewards. He releases
1:21:37
abundant life. When you choose to not really love him by choosing to doubt,
1:21:42
yes, it's a choice. You do not have to accept the feeling sent by the devil.
1:21:47
I'm telling you, these thoughts of doubt are from the devil.
1:21:56
The same way the devil came to Adam and Eve making trying to make them doubt
1:22:01
God's love for them and the plans he has for their life. When you have thoughts of doubt, you
1:22:08
need to be on guard and be serious. Uh-uh. devil. I love God.
1:22:14
I love him by having faith and not doubting. So get out of my mind. I will not accept any doubt. I'm
1:22:21
choosing to believe. I've made that covenant with God that I will love him. And that means having
1:22:27
faith and not doubting.
1:22:34
Some of you need to take this more seriously. You're thinking doing drugs and swearing
1:22:40
and sleeping around are the big sins. But according to this scripture, God
1:22:46
won't release these blessings to you simply because you doubt. You need to see doubting as a sin.
1:22:54
Not so that you would feel condemnation, but conviction. So that you could grow up spiritually
1:23:02
and take it more seriously the spiritual warfare that you're called to to be on guard in your mind. For the
1:23:09
devil roars around like a lion seeking whom he can devour, the Bible says. So
1:23:14
be on guard. Be on guard for thoughts of doubt. Do not allow yourself to meditate
1:23:20
on thoughts of doubt. Do not allow yourself to speak words of doubt.
1:23:30
You can do it. You can do this. I'm telling you,
1:23:37
you can shut up. You can bite your tongue.
1:23:46
You can do it. Now, you need to know. I'm letting God's letting you know you can do it. You have
1:23:52
Christ in you. You can do anything. [Applause]
1:24:05
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm telling you, I thank God for the
1:24:11
grace that he gave me to have this revelation early on when I first received the calling from God. And a lot of it has to do with my spiritual
1:24:17
father. just seeing how my spiritual father spoke. I mean, he just exhibited such big faith
1:24:25
and it just taught me so much in my interactions with him, just talking to him. Um, it it just taught me so much
1:24:31
how he wouldn't baby me, but he would just speak about God's
1:24:37
glorious plans for my life and these plans for revival and that they must happen.
1:24:44
and he never seemed worried of anything when the church was getting smaller and I'd share that with him, you know, just
1:24:51
like ju just his example taught me so much and I felt so convicted like, oh,
1:24:58
like this is really important that I have faith. Oh, this is really important that I
1:25:04
don't speak words of doubt. And so, I thank God for that grace to
1:25:09
have that revelation early on. And so I don't ever remember speaking words
1:25:16
really words of doubt. Maybe there's some but like just like in my memory I don't remember speaking words of doubt
1:25:23
through those four and a half years when our church got smaller and smaller and smaller.
1:25:28
I never spoke I there was somebody that asked um a question um on the live. They
1:25:34
said this this week they said there was one time when after the church shrunk
1:25:39
from 20some people down to 15 down to 10 down to five each year until 2020 COVID
1:25:44
hit. We had to have church outside. I'm now ministering in the park. Many times there's just two of us. Jeanal and I and
1:25:50
there was one time where Jeantal and I and Marissa were serving and we were outside. It was hundreds something
1:25:55
degrees in September. As you know it gets hot this time of year in LA. And it was September. It was 100 something
1:26:01
degrees. We went out in the park and um there was one person that showed up. I
1:26:07
don't know if she planned to be there or it was just in the park, but she was there. And I was preaching to her and in the middle of the message, she got up
1:26:12
and left. And this was after four and a half years of sewing, sewing, sewing, sewing and seeing the opposite of
1:26:17
harvest. And I turned to the live stream in that moment and I kept going. And I remember feeling discouraged after that.
1:26:24
But I I when I when I when I told my spiritual father about it, I I I didn't
1:26:30
speak words of doubt. I didn't speak words like I never spoke words ever like are you sure this is
1:26:37
working? Are you sure this is what God said? Because he as my spiritual father
1:26:42
would direct would lead me would would would would have prophetic direction as
1:26:48
he's the one that spoke revival is now. Amen. So, you know, God would speak through
1:26:54
him. And so, it's looking like it's not working, but not one time would I
1:27:01
question the word of God that came through him. Not one time would I question the word
1:27:07
of God that was spoken over my life and was spoken over the nation and the city
1:27:13
and this ministry of revival. That revival is now and revival is breaking
1:27:18
out. Not one time. There was many opportunities I could
1:27:24
have spoken words of doubt. But God had convicted me that that's not love. That's not obedience.
1:27:31
To speak words of doubt. To speak words of doubt is saying, "God, I don't
1:27:36
believe you. I know better." Yeah, we need to take it. You need to
1:27:42
take it more seriously if you want this abundant life. You can do it. I'm telling you, it's not
1:27:47
that hard. Just try it. And it leads to more peace and joy and promises being fulfilled. So it's the best thing you
1:27:54
can do. Hallelujah. [Applause]
1:28:04
Psalm 19:14. May the words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my rock
1:28:09
and my redeemer. May these words and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight.
1:28:17
This is what you should carry in your heart always. Um,
1:28:25
whenever you find a mountain, speak to the mountain. Whenever I'm telling you, when you are where the anointing is,
1:28:32
when you are where God's power is and you are planted and you are not opening up doors to the enemy,
1:28:38
you have to be healed. You have to be freed. You have to experience peace and joy. The devil can't win. the a and some
1:28:46
people over complicate things with their doubt. They're doubting and they're over complicating things. They're saying,
1:28:52
"Well, maybe I'm the exception. Something's not working." And as they're doing that, it's opening
1:28:57
up doors to the devil rather than defeating the devil. It's making the mountain bigger in front of you instead of speaking to the
1:29:04
mountain. But whenever you whenever you find attacks of the enemy,
1:29:11
try God on this. Speak to the mountain and see it move.
1:29:16
Maybe it's not immediately, but keep speaking it and you will see it will move.
1:29:28
You need to have faith in the revelation that's released where you're planted, the teachings. You need to have faith
1:29:33
that that these are really words of God. These are really principles of God. When I apply them, they have to work.
1:29:42
It is it's very simple. God is good. God wants me healed and freed. God has
1:29:47
principles and I am in line with his principles. And therefore, the devil can
1:29:53
have no hold on me. Therefore, any attack coming my way, the devil must flee as I reject him.
1:30:02
I must have peace and joy, protection and contentment. Period.
1:30:08
That's faith. Test God in that and watch how your life
1:30:13
changes. Start taking faith seriously. This principle of faith seriously.
1:30:19
If you struggle with if you've struggled with doubt, watch yesterday's message again several times. Meditate on it. I
1:30:27
shared last week about the principle of faith
1:30:33
and how to have faith. How to have a big faith. Um,
1:30:38
so God's love can be defined by faith and also obedience. John 14:15,
1:30:45
if you love me, Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commands."
1:30:52
This shows us to love God is to obey him. If you're not obeying God, if
1:30:59
you're knowingly not obeying God, you're not loving him.
1:31:05
Okay, maybe that sounds heavy. May, but I'm being real with you. You need to take obedience more
1:31:11
seriously. This is a big This has been a big problem in the church.
1:31:17
Not taking obedience to God seriously. treating Christianity as a culture,
1:31:24
as something to do, as something fun to do,
1:31:29
as something that makes you feel good, rather than laying down your life and
1:31:35
picking up the cross and being a true disciple, which is what Jesus says.
1:31:42
I'm sharing with you how to have abundant life. Abundant life. This life that I'm
1:31:48
talking about I I'm I'm sharing you how to have God's best,
1:31:54
his plans, his beautiful plans. There are many Christians who are living
1:31:59
an okay life because they're not opening up massive doors to the devil and God goes by principle and God has grace.
1:32:07
There's a lot of Christians having an okay life, a mediocre life, a much better life than a life um in the world,
1:32:17
but they're far from God's best. They're not living this kind of life
1:32:23
that I've experienced that that's possible.
1:32:28
This is what God wants for you. So, um if you love me, keep my commands.
1:32:35
If you love me, keep my commands. If you love me, keep my commands. What
1:32:40
are some of his commands? Resist the devil. Take every thought c. If you love
1:32:47
God, then whenever the devil is lying, whether it's a symptom, whether it's a
1:32:52
thought, love God in that moment by obeying his command as it says in the word. Submit
1:32:59
to Christ. Resist the devil and he must flee. Take every thought captive and
1:33:04
make it obedience to the knowledge of Christ.
1:33:10
Doing that is loving God. Doing that again and again and again as
1:33:16
many times as you have to is leading to God rewarding you and pouring out so
1:33:21
many blessings because you love him. You actually love him.
1:33:30
Whatever the Bible says, whatever is good, lovely, admirable, worthy, appraised, think of such things. You
1:33:35
have the choice of where you will put your mind. Will you put your mind on all the things going wrong in your life? On
1:33:41
all the ways the devil's attacking you, on all the negativity, or will you love God and obey this command and put your
1:33:49
mind on whatever is good, admirable, worthy of praise, lovely.
1:33:54
That is loving God. When you do that, be strong and courageous.
1:34:03
That's an action. That's a choice. So when you're feeling weak, when you're
1:34:08
feeling fearful, you have the choice to reject those feelings and lies and be
1:34:14
strong and courageous and do what God is calling you to do. When you do that, you are loving God. And that will lead to so
1:34:20
much reward. Hallelujah. So many times in the Bible, it says just
1:34:27
believe, believe, believe, believe. Again and again, God instructs us to
1:34:33
believe. Just simply believe. When you believe, you're loving God. You're
1:34:38
obeying his commands. So,
1:34:44
another thing that defines God's love is humility.
1:34:49
Humility. This is where a lot of people miss it. A lot of people miss it.
1:34:57
A lot of people prefer to hear the angel of light more than they prefer to hear
1:35:02
God's voice. The angel of light is the devil. The
1:35:09
Bible says the devil masquerades himself as an angel of light. It was very prophetic. We had a testimony Nicole
1:35:14
shared about being freed of the angel of light. She said, "Whatever thought just came, she would write it down.
1:35:21
There's there's a way to hear God's voice. The main way that God speaks is through his word,
1:35:27
through the written word, the Bible, but also through the spoken Rama word, the
1:35:32
word that comes through teachings of true anointed servants of God."
1:35:38
And it says in Ephesians, it says in Ephesians um 4:1-16 that God Jesus he
1:35:47
poured out this he poured out gifts to the church. These gifts were apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
1:35:53
teachers. And the purpose of these gifts are to equip the believers for works of
1:35:58
service. In other words, so that they can be who God called them to be. They can carry anointing, be powerful vessels
1:36:05
of God. But you have to you have to be equipped first to not be a baby but to grow
1:36:11
spiritually to have the spiritual eyesight to see and know the devil's schemes and know how to have victory
1:36:18
over the devil. So according to the word in Ephesians, this
1:36:25
is New Testament. The way that equipping happens, the way equipping of everything
1:36:32
in the spiritual realm, including how to hear God's voice comes from the
1:36:38
five-fold ministry, not just pastors, evangelists, and
1:36:43
teachers, but apostles and prophets. Ephesians 2:20 says that apostles and prophets are the foundation of the church.
1:36:51
What if you don't have a foundation? That's why there's a lot of problems, right?
1:36:59
So, so many people, they don't even know how to read the word of God because they haven't been properly equipped by a true
1:37:06
anointed servant of God. True anointed teaching opens up spiritual eyes. True anointed teaching
1:37:14
awakens your spirit man, opens the eyes of your spirit man, gives you understanding, gives you wisdom, gives
1:37:20
you an impartation of spiritual knowledge and wisdom and discernment.
1:37:26
Now you read the word of God and you can have this proper new wine revelation
1:37:33
rather than an old wine revelation, wrong revelation, whatever kind of wrong doctrine you had.
1:37:42
And so there's a lot of people that um they've been so led astray by the angel
1:37:49
of light in the church today. This is one of the biggest reasons why believers
1:37:54
are not walking in abundant life that I'm talking about is because they're
1:38:00
being led astray by the angel of light. Things that sound godly, the devil
1:38:06
puffing them up to think that they are so spiritual. They hear from God so amazingly.
1:38:14
Um because we have to be like children to enter in the kingdom of God. So when
1:38:21
people come become believers, the devil is smarter than you think.
1:38:26
He's been around for a while. And this is all he thinks about is how to keep
1:38:32
people from the fullness of God, from the kingdom. So he he he knows better than to tempt
1:38:40
people with things of the world in their past life. For the most part, when you become a believer,
1:38:47
for the most part, people don't want the things of the past anymore. They don't want to si do these sins of the past.
1:38:52
And so the big way that the devil strategically comes is as an angel of light, sounding like God coming in the
1:38:59
mind, coming in sometimes visions. You know, the devil can send signs too and
1:39:06
dreams and so he can come seeming spiritual but
1:39:11
it's not God. This is a big way that the devil comes in believers lives today.
1:39:19
How you can be protected from that from never being deceived by the devil masquerading
1:39:25
himself as an angel of light is following following God's principles that he has set up as I shared in in
1:39:31
Ephesians 4 of how to be equipped to be mature spiritually
1:39:38
to be planted in a true church where God's power is really moving where the
1:39:44
leader leaders are truly called by God truly anointed ointed and the Bible says
1:39:49
you'll know them by their fruits. So God doesn't make it difficult to find where
1:39:55
a true church where true anointed servants of God are. You just have to look at the fruit and test the fruits.
1:40:04
Fruits are the testimonies that people are actually being saved, healed, delivered, transformed.
1:40:10
and the fruits of the character of the servant of God of the of the leader that
1:40:15
they exhibit the fruits of the Holy Spirit, the character of Christ.
1:40:21
So um so many people they have been puffed up
1:40:27
with pride by the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light. is a
1:40:32
scheme of the devil to try to keep people from really hearing God's voice
1:40:38
because you can't love God if you're not following his voice.
1:40:48
It says in um John 10:20,
1:40:53
Jesus says to the disciples, "For it will not be you speaking." So this is he's speaking about um when if they're
1:41:01
ever persecuted and have to stand before a trial or anything like that that he says for it will not be you speaking but
1:41:07
the spirit of your father speaking through you.
1:41:13
The spirit of the father speaking through you. Um
1:41:19
he's saying that it won't be you speaking but God will be speaking through you.
1:41:27
God will not 90% God. God will be speaking through you. He says this to the apostles.
1:41:38
It says in um Matthew 10:41, "If you receive a prophet as one who speaks for
1:41:45
God, you will be given the same reward as a prophet. And if you receive
1:41:50
righteous people because of their righteousness, you will be given a reward like theirs." Another translation
1:41:56
says that you will be given a prophet's reward. So this is New Testament
1:42:02
Matthew. This is New Testament. God said Jesus is saying
1:42:09
you should be receiving prophets as one who speaks from God
1:42:15
as one who God is speaking through.
1:42:22
This could be said for apostles too that carry prophetic anointing.
1:42:28
This principle doctrine has been so lost in the body of Christ
1:42:34
for the most part because we have not seen apostles and prophets for the most part.
1:42:42
But true apostles and prophets, God speaks through.
1:42:49
And you have to humble yourself to hear the word of God coming through
1:42:55
them, coming through your leader.
1:43:01
There will be times where you don't understand, where you think differently because
1:43:08
the devil masquerade himself as an angel of light, speaking the opposite
1:43:15
in your past wrong doctrine. Or if you're struggling with humility,
1:43:21
he can easily be speaking many things that are contradicting the word of God,
1:43:27
contradicting what the word of God is speaking through your leader.
1:43:34
And we will always be confounded and not understand God's ways, but we don't need to understand God's ways to obey them.
1:43:44
You think Mary fully understood how she was going to give birth to the Messiah?
1:43:51
But she said, "Let it be done to me as you have said, for I am a servant of the Lord." Childlike heart obedience.
1:44:03
She didn't question. She didn't say, "I have a different idea in mind. I think God's saying this
1:44:10
actually because I had all these beautiful dreams. I dreams for my future and I
1:44:17
would have them literally in dreams and visions and I know that was God that
1:44:22
spoke these things for my future angel. So maybe you're an illusion.
1:44:29
That's what pride does, guys. That's what pride does.
1:44:36
You reject the voice of God when he so graciously spoke directly through you to
1:44:42
you through a servant of God.
1:44:48
One of the big keys of how I've experienced this abundant life is continually humbling myself to know that
1:44:55
I don't know it all. Humbling myself to see my position as
1:45:00
Elisha and not Elijah. not on the same level as my Elijah.
1:45:07
Positioning myself as Timothy rather than Paul. Not putting myself on the
1:45:12
same level as Paul. Knowing my place.
1:45:18
And I've experienced the Holy Spirit speaking to me so much directly to me as
1:45:23
I read the word. Him speaking directly to me. Not in audible voices, not in a
1:45:29
big shocking way, but a still small voice. I've experienced that so much.
1:45:34
God speaking directly to me without any vessel, without my spiritual father. But that revelation and word of God coming
1:45:42
to me has come from humbling myself continually to hear God's voice through
1:45:48
my spiritual father to this day. still hearing God's voice
1:45:55
through my spiritual father, not being prideful and being like, "Oh,
1:46:01
I'm good now. Look at the fruits in my ministry and everything. I'm good now.
1:46:07
I don't need to ask questions anymore. I don't need to be corrected anymore. Heck no.
1:46:16
May I always humble myself and never put myself on the same level as my spiritual
1:46:21
father when it comes to hearing God's voice.
1:46:27
When he speaks something, he's a true prophet of God. When he speaks something, it's God speaking.
1:46:33
There are times I haven't understood it, but I'm so glad I obeyed without understanding.
1:46:39
It is why I have seen this abundant life, fruits, revival.
1:46:49
And so many people miss this. I feel the heart of God wanting you to
1:46:55
grasp this principle. This is new wine. Wanting you to humble yourself to be
1:47:02
corrected because the devil is very deceptive. I'm
1:47:07
telling you, he's very deceptive. If you have pride, if you have a little
1:47:12
pride in you, he can easily deceive you.
1:47:18
I'm telling you, when you will humble yourself every day,
1:47:26
you will never be deceived. God directs the steps of the righteous.
1:47:32
Righteous means humble.
1:47:38
The disciples when they cast out demons, they came back to Jesus. They said, "Wow, we cast out demons." This is the
1:47:43
first time they cast out demons. And Jesus says, "I praise you, Father, for hiding these things from those who are
1:47:48
pride and pride prideful and know-it-alls and only revealing it to
1:47:55
the humble and childlike.
1:48:02
Your spiritual eyes will be opened. Your spiritual ears will be opened. You will
1:48:07
have total 100% perfect discernment to never be deceived by the devil when
1:48:15
and only when you humble yourself.
1:48:22
My heart burns. My heart burns for you, for the people in the body of Christ to
1:48:27
grasp this message because I know how much God wants to bless you with an abundant life. You could be
1:48:34
self-sabotaging yourself from the glorious plans God has for you by not humbling yourself
1:48:42
to hear God's word through your leader.
1:48:47
Amen. It says in um
1:48:53
2 Chronicles 20:20, they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Takcoa. And as they went
1:48:58
out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God and you shall be established. Believe
1:49:06
his prophets and you shall prosper.
1:49:11
Believe in the Lord your God and you shall be established. Remember I said there's a lot of believers that are
1:49:16
having good lives but not God's best. You shall be established when you believe in God.
1:49:23
You you shall establish means begin. You shall begin your life with God.
1:49:30
But if you want to prosper, believe his prophets.
1:49:36
I'm prospering because I've humbled myself to hear the word of God through a
1:49:42
true prophet.
1:49:47
This is how we prosper. Hallelujah.
1:49:54
It says also in um Acts 2:42,
1:50:02
they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship.
1:50:08
Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. Verse 46,
1:50:15
uh they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all people. The Lord added to
1:50:21
their number daily those who were being saved. So this is our example in the book of Acts of what believers are
1:50:28
supposed to look like. This looks like a joyous life.
1:50:34
This looks like a life in revival. Huh? They're constantly being awe and wonder
1:50:39
of the s signs and wonders being performed by the apostles. They are uh uh they have glad and
1:50:47
sincere hearts. They're praising God and they're enjoying the favor of all people.
1:50:52
They're they're enjoying the supernatural life coming upon their lives in every area. And the Lord on top
1:50:59
of that, the Lord increased revival. It kept increasing.
1:51:07
But okay, let's go back though. So they were experienc experiencing all this not
1:51:13
just because not randomly but because Acts 2:42
1:51:19
they devoted themselves
1:51:24
to the apostles teaching not they devoted themselves from hearing
1:51:31
God's voice however they want to hear God's voice
1:51:36
not they devoted themselves to seeking after signs visions, dreams, hearing God in the most
1:51:42
exciting ways. Now, God speaks through all those things, don't get me wrong, but the main
1:51:50
way God speaks is in his still small voice, in the word of God, and through
1:51:55
the word of God coming forth in the teachings of true anointed leaders.
1:52:03
And it is more rare that God comes in dreams and signs. He still will. But the
1:52:08
foundation has to be the word of God. The word of God written and spoken.
1:52:14
That's where you should be seeking. And then the other things sometimes will come in God's timing.
1:52:22
The other ways that God speaks in the earthquake, wind, and fire. But we have to be seeking after this
1:52:29
still small voice. That's God's main way of speaking to us. It's not as flashy.
1:52:35
It doesn't sound as impressive as this vision God gave me, the audible voice. A
1:52:42
lot of people like to seem spiritually important and brag
1:52:48
of these flashy ways God spoke to them. That's the intention. That's how the the
1:52:53
devil has deceived them coming as an angel of light. But the word says they devoted themselves
1:53:01
to the apostles teaching. They devoted themselves and that's how
1:53:07
they grew spiritually. That's how they grew in wisdom. That's how they grew in discernment. That's how they grew to be
1:53:14
victorious over the devil. That's how they grew in the knowledge of the principles of God.
1:53:22
Some words we don't really think about the meaning of them because they're a part of our language. Let's let's let's define devoted. This
1:53:28
is what Google says when I was searching devoted. Devoted describes someone or something
1:53:36
that is characterized by deep loyalty, affection and commitment to a person,
1:53:44
cause or belief. It signifies a strong dedication where one is willing to
1:53:50
prioritize the object of their devotion, showing a willingness to sacrifice their own needs to support it.
1:53:56
willing to sacrifice their own desires, willing to sacrifice their own ways of wanting to hear God or what they think
1:54:03
God is saying, but actually it's the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light.
1:54:09
The believers were devoted to the apostles teachings.
1:54:18
That's a powerful key right there in the word of God of how to prosper, have
1:54:25
abundant life, be used mightily by God.
1:54:31
I'm telling you, you need to be expectant for sometimes, you know, you're you're you're growing. You can't
1:54:38
expect God to speak all these things to you and you have no need for correction or or growth. You need to know there's a
1:54:46
devil out there who likes to come deceiving him, deceiving ways, masquering as an angel of light. So you
1:54:52
got to be prepared for to be confounded, to be corrected.
1:54:59
You got to be prepared for sometimes you think God is saying something, but actually he says something diff is
1:55:04
saying something different. Has anyone been 100% perfectly right about hearing God's voice here?
1:55:12
No. Has Has Has Has Has Has Has Has Has Has Has has Has has H has anyone experienced
1:55:18
being deceived by the devil? Like you thought God was saying something, but it really wasn't. Maybe it was someone you thought you're supposed to marry or
1:55:24
something. Something like that. You've all experienced that. You've all experienced that.
1:55:35
You got to remember. You got to remember that you're growing. You got to remember
1:55:40
that there's going to be times you thought God said something, but he he he's saying something different.
1:55:46
You you got to you got to humble yourself to that possibility so you can actually grow rather than continue be to
1:55:54
be deceived by the devil masquerade himself as an angel of light.
1:55:59
Amen. Amen. I urge you to value the words of God in his word and spoken
1:56:09
the teachings. I come to you not on my own. I come to
1:56:14
you not feeling like. When a prophet says something, it's God speaking. A prophet doesn't feel like.
1:56:22
My and an apostles walk in the prophetic. My spiritual father is a prophet.
1:56:28
There's so much I've received from him and continue to receive every day. Spiritual direction, any questions I
1:56:34
have, sometimes issues in some of your lives. And he sees as a prophet.
1:56:40
And some of the direction I've given many of my spiritual children has come from a prophet,
1:56:45
but you don't know it. And you dismiss it.
1:56:53
And so I just I urge you I urge you to humble yourself
1:56:58
and value the gift that God has given you that we can hear his voice clearly.
1:57:05
Ever since I've walked in my calling, I become a spiritual daughter over my spiritual f under my spiritual father, Prophet Joe Davyy.
1:57:12
I've walked in God's will. I remember there's times I had to be corrected. I
1:57:17
remember one time early on I didn't obey God quick enough. my spiritual father said directed something and and and I
1:57:25
didn't do it quickly and my spiritual father could see prophetically and I'll never forget the the the the
1:57:33
like anger of God you know like the come on this is important you obey me quickly
1:57:39
came upon me but God's grace was there no condemnation glory to God because I knew to not be deceived of that but I
1:57:45
got on my knees and I wept before God.
1:57:56
I'm telling you, I've I've walked in God's will for all these years now. I say that with humility. I say that
1:58:03
humbly having my spiritual father as a prophet and not doing things my own way and not
1:58:09
doing things thinking I know better sometimes but being so careful to be in the will
1:58:16
of God and to obey God every day.
1:58:22
So I just want to I want to encourage you all like to to value what you have
1:58:29
here to value to devote yourselves to the teachings
1:58:35
to to to to not take the word the direction the prophetic direction
1:58:42
if you ever have questions the prophetic direction to not take it lightly
1:58:48
but devote yourselves to the teachings as they did in the book of Acts. Devote,
1:58:57
set aside your own feelings and ambitions.
1:59:03
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
1:59:16
Thank you, Jesus.
1:59:21
Hallelujah. Are you ready for God's best for your life?
1:59:30
Hallelujah. I'm telling you, you will be shocked as
1:59:38
things unfold. When you start to see the harvest time, when you start to see the reaping time,
1:59:44
you will be shocked. You will be completely blown away. I urge all of you to surrender
1:59:51
everything to Jesus. I urge all of you, can you stand up right now?
Corporate Prayer
1:59:57
I urge all of you to search your hearts right now.
2:00:03
Search your hearts. Where has there been disobedience? Where has there been pride?
2:00:12
Where has there been an ounce that wasn't surrender?
2:00:17
Is there something in your life where you think you know best and you are being resistant to hearing God's voice?
2:00:26
Is there an area in your life where that is the case? I urge you to seek your heart right now.
2:00:35
And I want to invite you all to repent. Whatever you need to repent,
2:00:43
whatever you haven't surrendered totally to God to surrender totally.
2:00:54
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Tell God that you want his best,
2:01:02
that you want his plans completely, his dreams.
2:01:07
I urge you to surrender your dreams to to say, "Lord, if if your dreams aren't
2:01:13
completely my dreams, if you're calling me to lay down a dream or more and adopt
2:01:18
yours instead, I want to do that. Lord,
2:01:29
just speak to God from your heart right now. I urge you to step into the glorious
2:01:35
future that God has for you. [Music]
2:01:41
A life of heaven on earth. A life of abundance upon abundance.
2:01:48
Step into it now. Leave the just good enough life
2:01:56
and step into the abundant life now.
2:02:12
I pray the spiritual eyes would open up right now. I pray that any way the devil's trying to deceive you, any way
2:02:19
the devil's trying to deceive you, coming as an angel of light, any way the devil is trying to blind you, I declare
2:02:25
that would go from you now. Your eyes would open up in Jesus name.
2:02:31
I declare nothing can keep you from God's plans. Nothing can keep you from God's
2:02:37
beautiful, perfect plans in your life in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus.
2:02:43
Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
2:02:53
May there be chosen ones here. May there be chosen ones here. Everyone, may you be chosen. May you choose to be chosen.
2:03:05
[Music] Thank you, Holy Spirit. Thank you, Holy
2:03:12
Spirit. Thank you, Holy Spirit. Hallelujah.
2:03:18
Thank you, Holy Spirit. If there's anybody here who's never been
2:03:24
baptized in the in the fire of the Holy Spirit, and if there's anybody here who
2:03:30
has been struggling with surrender, you want to surrender, but you've been stuck, come to the front right now. If
2:03:38
you've never been baptized in fire or struggling to surrender, but you want to,
2:03:43
you feel like something's blocking you.
2:03:48
If you pray in the spirit, pray in the spirit right now.
2:03:58
Love you with all my heart, all my mind,

2:04:36
and strength. We want to love you with all my heart,
2:04:42
everything, all my soul,
2:04:47
all my mind and strength. [Music]
2:04:54
I feel the fire of the Holy Spirit in this place. I feel the fire. It is time
2:05:00
to lay down this lukewarm life. It's time to go into full humility, full
2:05:07
surrender, full obedience. It's time now. Today is the day. This is
2:05:14
the glorious month of new beginnings. Oh,
2:05:20
is the glorious month of new beginnings. In this eighth month, which means new
2:05:25
beginnings, today is the last day. Oh, today is to surrender everything to Jesus. Oh.
2:05:42
He's worthy. He's worthy. He's worthy.
2:05:49
He's worthy of your full surrender.
2:05:56
This is the year of God's acceptance. It's time to accept him in all his ways
2:06:03
and all the ways he speaks.
2:06:12
Thank you, Holy Spirit. Oh,

2:31:48
thing, one thing, one thing that you try to ignore, but it's pride.
2:31:55
Look deeply right now and don't let it stay there. renounce it right now so you
2:32:01
will not be hunted by the devil. Because when you don't renounce and turn away from that thing, the devil continually
2:32:08
hunts you. So I encourage you right now, renounce on this. This is a prophetic
2:32:14
moment right now of new beginnings. This is a time to go into total surrender for
2:32:20
every person here and watching. Don't miss this moment ordained by God to step
2:32:26
into your glorious future with Jesus that he has planned for you. Amen.
2:32:32
Speak aloud right now. Whatever you need to renounce, just speak it aloud right now.

2:36:36
touching somebody in in the womb. If someone's pregnant right now, maybe someone who's watching, too. There's
2:36:42
somebody their baby had a problem. God is healing them right now. Be healed right now in Jesus' name. Thank you,
2:36:49
Lord. And I see God delivering someone of fear. There's a there's an an intense
2:36:54
fear, a specific fear they have like an irrational fear. I declare this fear must go right now in Jesus' name. And I
2:37:02
see someone also because of a trauma they had where they didn't expect and it caused so much disappointment. It caught
2:37:08
them off guard. Um something a loss came, a disappointment came. So now
2:37:14
there has been such an intense fear of this same thing happening again. So I
2:37:20
declare this fear must leave now in Jesus' name. And I declare everything
2:37:26
holding you back from confident hope and expectation in Jesus in his plans that
2:37:32
he has for you, it must go in Jesus' name. Thank you Lord. Lift your hands
2:37:38
right now to God. Thank you Jesus. I speak this anointing to come upon you
Prayer of the Week
2:37:44
all now in Jesus' name. And may more of the fire of the Holy Spirit come and
2:37:51
fill you in Jesus name. May you have more of the mind of God, more of the heart of God. May you be more like Jesus
2:37:58
today. How you think, how you see, how you feel, how you act. May God's heart and mind come in you
2:38:06
more now upon this surrender, this greater surrender that you went into
2:38:11
today in Jesus' name. And I declare that the things from the past can no longer
2:38:16
haunt you or hunt you. I declare that you are detached from your past, from
2:38:22
your past sins, from your past self, from your past fleshly self, from the
2:38:28
past trauma, from the past disappointment, from the past patterns,
2:38:34
from the past stagnancy in your life. You are detached from that. It is gone.
2:38:40
And today is a new beginning for the rest of your life. I declare today is a
2:38:45
new beginning of walking in God's will every day. I declare it's a new
2:38:52
beginning of experiencing abundant life every day and blessings unfolding in
2:38:58
your life every day and harvest on the horizon soon. It is time right now for
2:39:05
you to experience heaven on earth, the supernatural blessings of God. Because
2:39:10
you are loving God, because you have loved God with your life with your
2:39:15
surrender, obedience, and humility. I speak great peace and joy to fill you
2:39:22
now. And for this week, I declare nothing to hold you back from this act
2:39:29
of surrender that you that you took today. that you would walk in the surrender day by day by day. That you
2:39:36
would grow in your humility every day. That you would become lower in every area of pride what must come out in
2:39:43
Jesus' name. I declare victory over the devil. That you would have great discernment of the devil's schemes and
2:39:50
you would have victory every time, every moment, every day in Jesus' name. May
2:39:57
you be in the middle directly in God's will every day in Jesus' name. And may
2:40:04
you experience heaven on earth because you've stepped into his will in Jesus'
2:40:11
name. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. [Music]

give to God right now. We are going to give to God. So, you can make your way back to your seat and we're going to
2:41:26
take a moment to thank God through giving. Can I have the iPad? [Music]
2:41:39
We can put up the scriptures that I shared. [Music]
2:41:46
We can put up the offering scriptures. Okay. So, Matthew 6:19, "Don't store up
2:41:55
treasures here on earth where mos eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your
2:42:02
treasures in heaven where moss and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal. Wherever your treasure is,
2:42:09
there the desires of your heart will also be."
2:42:14
When you give to God, there is a reward that your blessings on this earth from
2:42:22
physical to spiritual are protected. They will not be stolen by thieves. They
2:42:29
will not be eaten by moths. Amen. It says in Malachi 3:10, "Bring all the
2:42:34
tithes into the storehouse so there'll be enough food in my temple. If you do, I will open the windows of heaven for you. I will pour out a blessing so great
2:42:41
you won't have room to take it in. Try it. Put me to the test. Your crops will be abundant for I will guard them with
2:42:48
in guard them from insects and disease. Your grapes will not fall from the vine before they are ripe. Then all nations
2:42:55
will call you blessed for your land will be such a delight, says the Lord. Hallelujah.
2:43:02
So, you know, this is where th this is one of those verses again where God says, I will bless you so mightily when
2:43:11
you do this. When you love me with everything, including my church, my work, giving to
2:43:18
my work, if you will love me with this obedience
2:43:24
of doing this, if you will love me by denying yourself and putting my work
2:43:29
first, seeking first the kingdom. Amen. So, it actually says in here, I will pour
2:43:35
out so great a blessing, you won't have room for it. Your crops will be abundant. I will guard them from insects
2:43:40
and disease. I will guard them from insects and disease. When you give to
2:43:45
God, your crops will be abundant. They will be guarded from they will be guarded from insects and disease.
2:43:54
Today, our crops are not in the field, but our crops are the finances that we
2:43:59
have from working, from the from your business, from your ministry. That's your crops. And God literally
2:44:05
supernaturally protects them, makes them to be abundant and protects the abundance because you have given to
2:44:12
God's work. That's powerful to give to his kingdom. Amen. So I want to
2:44:18
encourage you to store up your treasure in heaven where you access abundant life
2:44:25
and protection here on this earth. protection in every way, even your
2:44:30
finances. You are protected as you obey God and ser serve contribute to his
