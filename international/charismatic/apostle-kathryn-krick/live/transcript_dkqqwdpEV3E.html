7:13
going to do something so mighty, powerful, and different in Europe, in the Netherlands, like we have never

7:27
Any way that the enemy has held you back, has held you back from experiencing revival in your life and
7:34
revival in your city and your nation, any kind of heaviness the devil has put, any kind of strongholds, demonic
7:40
strongholds he has placed in your life to experience abundant life and revival
7:46
and for your city and nation to experience revival. These strongholds are going to be broken
7:53
and it is going to be a triumphant day uh where God will be glorified
8:00
and we will see him do mighty signs and wonders and what he does at this event
8:05
is going to have a ripple effect throughout all of Europe. What he does at this event is going to be
8:11
groundbreaking, earthshattering in the spiritual realm. It is something so special and powerful
8:19
and unique and mighty and and at just a a significant time of breakthrough is
8:27
what is going to happen at this event. And so those of you in the Netherlands and Europe, I encourage you to not miss
8:34
this. I encourage you to get there. I encourage you to invite your friends and your family and just have a heart for
8:41
everyone you know to receive and to be there to experience what God is going to
8:47
do to witness and receive the signs and wonders and miracles that he is going to
8:53
do. That is going to be so powerful, leaving us in awe and wonder.
8:59
Hallelujah. I'm so excited. This is a free event. You can go to the link in my
9:04
bio or 5fchurch.org/events to register. Now, both for Brazil and
9:11
for this event, we have funds a fund section on our giving page where you can donate. The Brazil event, this is hosted
9:19
entirely by 5F Church and it is free. We have made it free so that nobody can miss out. So that nothing could hold
9:26
back anybody from receiving. So, but but that said, it's all on Five Church. It's
9:32
all it's all on us to carry that to carry all of the costs. So, it's all
9:38
based on all your donations. So, first of all, thank you for donating so that this can even be possible. And I just
9:43
want to encourage you to have a heart. If you live in Brazil and if you have a heart for the people of Brazil, I
9:49
encourage you to give and donate to this event. And the Army of Arise Revival Night, this is not hosted by 5F Church,
9:56
but it is hosted by the 5F Church small group leaders in the Netherlands. And um
10:02
we moved our venue. We changed the venues and we changed the venues to it's it's a bigger venue and but this is an
10:11
extreme increase of cost that was not expected. So um I have opened up we've
10:18
opened up a fund so that you can donate. So I want to really encourage you especially if you're in the Netherlands
10:25
and in Europe I encourage you to sew. Why? I I encourage everyone to sort of
10:31
have a heart for the people to receive. But I also want to really just share
10:37
those of you in the in Europe and the Netherlands, there is such power in sewing. Um it is really a spiritual war.
10:44
It is really a spiritual war for revival to be in one's n in your nation in your
10:53
city. It is a spiritual war. It does not come easily because the devil wants to
11:01
stop revival. The devil does not want revival in your city or nation. And
11:06
there will be a spiritual war. But we fight in the spiritual war with our our our spiritual weapons. Our spiritual
11:13
weapons of obedience, our spiritual weapons to contribute to God's work. And
11:20
you know like this revival event that's happening it's a huge cost for that to
11:25
happen even like for me and John tall comes with me as well like for us to travel there that itself is a very huge
11:32
cost and then the venue itself and everything that goes into it all the
11:38
different things that go into events like the lighting and the sound and all these different details. It costs a lot
11:46
to have an event where God moves in power and touches thousands of people.
11:51
It's a big cost. And so when you contribute to that work of God that God
11:58
God appoints us to go and do this work to go and minister and as we show up and
12:04
minister, God moves in power and does things that changes the region, the
12:11
nation, the continent. like he does mighty things in the spiritual realm. He
12:16
he's at at at this event in Netherlands, he is equipping these you revival warriors. He is pouring out more of his
12:23
fire. He's pouring out impartation of anointing so that this because that's a big way that revival spreads is when the
12:30
army is strong. That's that's that's the biggest part of revival spreading is
12:36
when the army is equipped and strong and carries the fire. And that's not a
12:41
one-time thing. it. You know, you need these significant moments of
12:46
impartation, these significant moments, these divine appointments where God pours out more of his fire, more of his
12:55
anointing, so you can come against these demonic forces trying to stop revival,
13:02
trying to stop God's move, and you can stand strong and overcome.
13:07
Amen. Um, and so, you know, this is what God God is doing. this mighty move that
13:13
is going to lead to revival expanding greatly. But there's a cost for us
13:18
always. There is a cost. There is a cost to carrying the anointing. There's a cost to revival in your land. This cost
13:25
is like is everything. It's your whole life. It's your surrender, your obedience in every area. your surrender
13:31
obedience in every area financially, you know, to to sew into revival in your
13:39
nation to say, you know, I am giving my all to God's work, to his revival. The
13:47
devil is working hard to stop God's move. Well, I'm not going to allow the
13:53
devil to be more passionate and give his all more than more than me for God. You
14:02
know, I'm going to give my all, give my everything to Jesus and his move. And
14:10
when the the revival army arises in this way, rises up in this way, gives their
14:15
all, contributes to the work of God, stands strong and says the devil cannot
14:24
win. There must be revival in my nation. There must be revival in my city. That's
14:30
when God moves so mightily and fights the devil and defeats the devil. Um when
14:38
we take that stand that stand of obedience and surrender and sacrifice
14:44
and pay that cost the spiritual cost which also is a physical cost in in some
14:51
cases. Amen. And so I really want to encourage you to sew with that heart knowing that this is what God is asking.
14:58
That this is this is how victory is coming when you don't
15:04
take it lightly. The move of God, the anointing, when you don't take that lightly, but
15:10
you value it. Amen. So you can go to 5church.org/give /give um or the link in

16:30

Message
16:38
this message is protect your light. God has called you to be the light of the
16:44
world and he has called you to shine so brightly
16:51
that the darkness would diminish that people in darkness
16:57
would come into the light and would no longer be in darkness. Um, the greatest way that people are
17:04
saved and come into the kingdom and encounter Jesus in every way is when
17:10
your light is shining. Because when your light is shining, that's Jesus shining through you. And we
17:16
are called to be attractive like full of God's love, the fruits of
17:22
the Holy Spirit that when people look at us, they're not turned off, but they are
17:28
curious. They want more. They They want to know. They They want to be They want
17:35
to be like you. They want what you have. They want that peace and that joy, but they also want the fruits of the Holy Spirit that you have. Um and there's
17:43
just this presence about you that's like it's heaven. It's heavenly. It makes them feel um peaceful just to be around
17:51
you. It just makes them feel at ease. Uh and so that leads them to, you know,
17:58
having a a an ear to listen, an ear to listen to you, to your
18:03
testimony. That in a summary is being the light of
18:08
the world. That is how we shine. And um so so so so when you encounter
18:17
Jesus and as you be transformed more into his image by surrendering your
18:23
life, walking in obedience to him. And a big part of those those things includes
18:29
being planted at one church where God is calling you to. Not just any church, but
18:34
a church that really has the fruits that looks like the book of Acts where the
18:40
power of God is moving. People are being healed, delivered, and transformed where the leadership has the fruits of the
18:46
Holy Spirit, shining the light of Jesus so brightly.
18:51
And that that light, that power, that Christlikeness coming from the head,
18:57
from leadership pours down onto the rest of the body. That's a big way that that
19:03
transformation comes is it it flowing it flowing through the teachings it flowing
19:10
through the love shown the example shown it flowing by people watching and um
19:17
seeing the right way to go the right way to act what it means to be Christlike.
19:24
Paul says imitate me as I imitate Christ. Um, so as you look, as you
19:30
imitate, that's how you that's a big way that you are transformed to be more like Jesus. Amen. So, um, what's so important
19:40
to remember is that your your simple assignment every day is to be the light
19:46
of the world. To be the light. That that should be your simple
19:51
assignment that you keep in your heart. It's very simple. Very simple. But it should you should keep it in your heart
19:57
that you must be the light. That you must not let your light dim.
20:06
You must shine bright. You must put your light up high as the Bible says on a stand.
20:13
Don't hide it. You're a city on a hill. Let your light be seen. Let your good deeds be seen.
20:20
Uh so every day you need to know the way that I am fulfilling my assignment on
20:26
this earth and the way that God is able to use me the most is by shining my
20:31
light. Now sometimes maybe you don't interact with anybody that whole day. Um but I as
20:38
I shared in a previous recent message, the Bible says uh let your good shine
20:44
your light and let your good deeds be seen. So you can be behind the scenes
20:50
serving God and still shining your light as you serve with excellence as you serve with a good heart, with a servant
20:56
heart, and as you work, as you're doing it for the Lord. Um you're letting your
21:01
good deeds shine. But also you know a big part of shining your light is so much you know your interactions with
21:07
people as I mentioned in the beginning that people would be attracted to your light. Um so even on days where you
21:14
don't come face to face with people may you know you some of you maybe work at home you know some of you maybe you
21:20
don't even see anybody that day but you you still need to be thinking how can I
21:26
shine my light the greatest day because number one many of you maybe you're posting on social media at least once a
21:32
day and y'all should at least once a day by sharing the good news by sharing what
21:38
God is doing in his revival by sharing testimonies by sharing that. That's a big way that
21:43
you're called to shine your light. Amen. But secondly, um you got to be thinking every day
21:50
about your light, about protecting your light and about shining your light so that the light stays on. So that when if
21:56
you're not around people one day, but the next day you are or maybe you don't see people for many days or many people for many days, that light's got to be
22:03
ready. You can't let that light be dimmed every day. You got to be protecting your light. And
22:11
a big meaning of protecting your light is guarding your heart. It says Proverbs 4:23, "Above all else, guard your heart
22:20
for everything you do flows from it."
22:25
Above all else, above all else. Meaning, this is the most important thing. And
22:30
that's why that's what I'm saying right now. Every day you got to be thinking, I got to shine my light. I got to protect my
22:37
light. So your heart meaning all the things that God's revealed to
22:44
you, the new wine you have received, the way your eyes have opened up to the
22:49
right way, the Jesus way, the new wine, um the the the the way he's transformed
22:56
you, how you used to be a certain way, but now you're more Christlike. You have the fruits of the Holy Spirit.
23:02
um your peace, your joy that he's given
23:08
you. Now, that's your heart. Okay? Those these are the things in your heart that God has put in your heart. And so, you
23:15
have to guard this above all. That's your light. That's your light. As you show the fruits of the Holy Spirit, as
23:20
you show your joy and your peace through your words, through your actions, through your smile, through your face,
23:26
through the things you post online, that's your light. It comes from what's
23:31
in your heart. It comes from what God has revealed to you. Open your eyes up to um and cultivated in you. Transform
23:39
how you've transformed as you've denied your flesh and sought the Lord and his
23:44
the fire of his spirit the anointing fed your spirit made your spirit man to arise and push down the flesh. You have
23:51
to you have to steward that. You have to protect that and steward that. It can be lost. It can dwindle away. It can the
23:57
devil can start chipping away at that transformation that has come. The devil can start chipping away at that light if
24:03
you aren't careful to protect your light to guard your heart. And you need to
24:09
know that there will be times there will be specific times where the enemy will come and attack in this way. There will
24:15
be specific times where the enemy will come with a specific plan, a specific
24:21
scheme to try to get you to dim your light, to try to get you to not to catch
24:27
you off guard so that you aren't protecting your heart. You got to be aware of this. If you start to feel that
24:33
temptation to go backwards, that temptation to not be as Christlike, that
24:38
temptation to not have peace and joy, this should be like an an alarm system
24:44
going off in the spiritual realm in your mind.
24:49
This is what I have learned that would come someday. The devil is specifically
24:54
he's he's schemed right now. He's trying specifically right now to get me to dim my light to to to get me to not protect
25:01
my light. So, I need to renew my mind. I need to go in the spirit. I need to watch what I'm doing that's making me
25:08
lazy about protecting my light. Amen. Um a big area
25:17
where um a big area where people
25:23
are not careful about protecting their heart and protecting their light and guarding their heart is social media.
25:34
That's a big area. as a big area because um
25:41
it's so normal today. I mean it's just the the customs of today to be on social
25:48
media to follow many people. Um
25:54
and it doesn't seem like a big deal because it's just like as long as you're not spending too much time usually on
26:01
social media, it probably feels like no problem, no big deal. Maybe as long as
26:07
you're not following super worldly accounts. I mean, you shouldn't be following people that are that are very
26:14
that are worldly. I mean, because you have to guard your eyes and your ears. You have, you know,
26:24
that so easily
26:29
something can come in. Something can come in through what you're seeing through your in your ears that you
26:35
didn't want to come in. But because you've opened the door to follow somebody that's not surrendered to God,
26:40
they have opened doors to the devil, they can post something. It could it
26:47
could be just something demonic, something the music is demonic or the words they're saying is demonic.
26:54
um or what they're showing or like of the flesh like something like uh
27:00
sexual sexually like how they're dressed or how they're putting their body you know just one second can something can
27:10
drop in your spirit something can drop in your heart by just one second you're
27:15
seeing that so you really need to make sure you are not following people where
27:20
they have these doors open to the enemy I talk about the importance of having boundaries and relationships a lot. But
27:28
in today's day, you know, it's almost like people are having
27:34
relationships with people they don't even know with celebrities because of the amount they are seeing them and
27:39
listening to them. You know, like a friend you maybe you only see once a week and have a coffee date once a week,
27:46
but you're you're so careful making sure I don't bring the wrong people in close. But yet someone worldly or not just
27:53
worldly but a Pharisee, someone with so much old wine, you're listening to maybe you're
27:59
listening to them every day, maybe just one minute. But you know, you you need
28:04
to really realize that this can really stunt your spiritual growth if you're
28:10
listening to the wrong voices. It can be a way that the devil's sneakily coming
28:16
in to make your flesh stronger. and try to influence you. So, um this is
28:25
this is really serious what you are watching on social media. Uh and I
28:30
shared this past Sunday about there's a teaching where I mean there's a scripture where Paul says you have many
28:37
teachers but only one father only I became your spiritual father in Christ.
28:45
This is New Testament. So this shows us that having a spiritual father or mother is biblical is what we are supposed to
28:51
do. We are supposed to have one spiritual leader, spiritual mother or spiritual father. This is where you are
28:57
planted. This is where God has called you to be planted. And that that leader of that church would be your spiritual
29:03
father or spiritual mother. And um you know in when when when uh Paul was
29:11
saying um you have you may have many teachers. He was not referring to just any old
29:19
teacher that talks about God. It talks about Jesus. You may have many of them.
29:25
But he's referring to where you are planted. There may be other teachers
29:31
where you are planted teaching but you have only one spiritual father. So um
29:38
you know being planted a big a big reason why being implanted is important is God's design to equip
29:46
you to nourish you to protect you spiritually to impart to you to walk in your
29:54
calling. Um, a big reason why God calls you to be in just one place is because
30:01
he is going to put you, he's going to place you in the ministry that you're supposed to be
30:09
because of your calling, because of your specific assignment on this earth.
30:14
Because of your specific assignment on this earth, that's that's where God will
30:20
place you. And so the equipping, the impartation
30:26
that you are receiving where you are planted, it is not for everybody.
30:31
It is for those who are called to that same vision.
30:37
It is those who are called to that assignment.
30:42
So you know like at Fivefold Church God has called us to be vessels of him
30:49
to bring revival to the world to the whole world.
30:55
What God wants to do right now and what he is doing right now is restoring what
31:01
has been lost in the book of Acts. What has been lost since the times Jesus was
31:07
ministering. What he demonstrated for us. what being a believer should look like, a follower of Jesus, a follower of
31:14
Jesus should look like, what um ministry should look like. And then in the book
31:19
of Acts, our example of what church should look like, the structure of church, the foundation of church,
31:26
there's been a lot that has been lost in today's church in the body of Christ.
31:33
And so what God wants to do and is doing and will continue to do is bring a great
31:41
transformation, a great beautifification, a great purification
31:48
to the body of Christ. God is bringing power,
31:55
purity, and order. Power, purity, and order.
32:04
These things are missing by and large seriously from the body of Christ.
32:12
These three things are seriously missing.
32:17
And God by by most in in most pl in most ministries, most churches, most
32:23
believers, but God has brought this revival and this transformation and
32:28
purification has already begun. has already begun to take place
32:35
and so much has changed already. So much. Hallelujah.
32:41
And I mean, I'm not just saying this, but I have heard so many testimonies
32:47
pretty much on a daily basis of people testifying of since they've stepped into
32:52
this revival, since they become planted at Five Fifel Church, for example, they
32:57
have for the first time in their lives, even though they were a believer their whole life, for the first time in their life, they're actually being Christlike
33:06
like in in like every area where they were, that was not the case before and
33:12
they are being able to to love people now where they couldn't before. They are able to have humility now where they
33:18
didn't before. They are able to have purity and heart where they didn't before. They are able to be selfless
33:24
where they couldn't before. They are able to be humble and loving and compassionate rather than judgmental and
33:29
pride where when that is how they were before as believers. Glory to God. I
33:35
have heard testimony after testimony on a daily basis concerning this fact. So that really shows you it is already
33:42
begun and God has already done such a great work. Hallelujah.
33:48
There's still a great work to be done though. There is still a great work to be done and the last shall be first and
33:54
the first shall be last. So what I mean by that is like those who will really
34:00
humble themselves the most and those who will really see them rightly themselves rightly who will really become low will
34:07
be the first. So the disciples of Jesus,
34:13
they were the last like the last people you would expect that the Messiah would
34:20
choose to follow him closely um and be the first um servants of God
34:30
uh be the first servants of God in in the new wine in the new way in the the
34:36
after Jesus's res resurrection. ction when the Holy Spirit came to the earth. Um the ones who would be first, you
34:44
would think would be first would be the Pharisees would be the ones who were
34:50
were who people looked up to. The ones who um had all of this knowledge and charisma
34:57
and um favor from people like people really loved them and followed them,
35:04
you know. But the this the disciples that Jesus chose were nobodyies. They were nobodies. They were average
35:11
Joe's. Okay? And um
35:17
you know that the this the knowledge of the word of God and the charisma and their their way of public speaking did
35:23
not compare to the Pharisee leaders for example. Um and you know even there was tax
35:31
collectors, there was there was sinners that repented and you know the the
35:39
Pharisees would have looked down on you know there's a scripture where a Pharisee goes
35:45
I've tithed, I've fasted and I'm so glad I'm not like this sinner
35:52
over here. Like I'm so glad that I fast all the time and I tithe all the time
35:57
and I'm so glad that I am like a really good follower of God.
36:04
I'm so glad I'm not like that gross sinner over there who's so evil.
36:10
Um and then the the Bible says that the
36:15
tax collector who was a sinner cuz tax collecting back then they were um very
36:22
immoral with their business. So they were looked down upon like how
36:29
I don't know like thieves would be looked at today like just doing dirty
36:34
work you know how people look down on them. So, um, the Bible says that the
36:41
the tax collector went was actually the
36:47
righteous one. So, like he was the one that was saved. He was the one that
36:53
really was saved and was righteous and that had a heart after God because he
37:00
genuinely repented. this tax collector. That's why it says that because this this tax collector genu genuinely
37:06
repented from the heart. Okay? But even though he's genuinely repenting from the heart, the Pharisee
37:12
is so full of pride and judgment that he's not even seeing that and he's just seeing him as an evil person. Um and so
37:22
whoa, that you know that scripture is really
37:27
shocking. I mean, it's just a really powerful scripture that um
37:35
like God really looks at the heart. God really looks at the heart. God really
37:41
looks at the heart. And so this this Pharisee, even though he was doing good Christian things, he
37:47
he wasn't even considered saved um and righteous before God,
37:54
you know. So um yeah, so
38:01
the the tax collector, right? So that's like that's that's one of the meanings of the the the first shall be last and
38:07
the last shall be first. So this Pharisee is like, "Yes, when the
38:13
Messiah comes, like I'm going to be the first one there because I'm so I'm such a great Christian. I'm doing such great
38:18
works and I'm I'm tithing and I'm fasting. I'm first. He was last.
38:27
And the one he would have considered last, the world considers his last. The
38:32
world considers his evil. Um became first because when they re when he really when the tax collector really
38:38
encountered Jesus, he repented. When you encounter Jesus's power in love, you will repent. People are doing really
38:44
evil things in the world, but they just need to encounter God's power and love. But that's our job to be vessels for
38:52
people to encounter God's power and love to be the light to really shine the light of Jesus. So there's a scripture
38:58
that says um they beware in the end times there will be people who um
39:08
they are wicked. They will deny they will have a form of godliness. They'll
39:14
have a form of godliness like the tax collector. I mean not the tax collector like the story of the
39:20
Pharisee and the tax collector like the Pharisee but deny the power that could
39:26
save them. They deny the power that could really transform them.
39:33
So in the end times there will be people who have a form of godliness but reject
39:38
God's power, reject revival, reject God's power that will actually bring transformation. So like there will be
39:44
people in the last days that will be like the Pharisees who um will reject revival, will reject God's servants,
39:50
will reject God's power. And that's the power that could actually change them and save them. And so the the tax
39:58
collector actually did accept God's p God's um
40:04
God's power and love. And so he he could be transformed and then he could be saved because he no longer wanted to sin
40:11
and wanted to now follow Jesus and live differently. So um the people in this
40:16
world that are in darkness, they need the light. As simple as that. They need the light. And the light can't come
40:22
through the Pharisees way, the old wine way. The light can only come by through God's power. First of all, for us to be
40:29
vessels of God's power, we need to embrace God's power. So God's power can transform us so that we can really
40:35
represent Jesus rightly and God can entrust us with anointing. And then step two, God moves through us in power to
40:41
touch people. Um so yeah, the the disciples were would be considered to be
40:49
last, but they were they were first. So in this revival,
40:54
the same thing is happening. The first shall be last. The last shall be first. So
41:01
those that would be expected to come first will be last
41:08
if ever if they ever decide to come. But those who will be considered to be
41:15
last will be first. The nobbodyies, the average Joe people.
41:22
So, there's an important lesson, by the way, in that is that like make sure
41:27
you're not looking up to like like the the Pharisee, you know, the Pharisee
41:34
who's saying, "I've tithed. I've fasted." Make sure you're not looking up to that person. Um
41:42
because that's not that that can really lead you astray and put you in the the last category as you follow them. It can
41:50
really taint that new wine in you and start to put old wine again.
42:05
Luke 5:37 it says, "And no one puts new wine into old wine skins, for the new
42:10
wine would burst the wine skins, spilling the wine and ruining the wine skins. New wine must be stored in new
42:16
wine skins. But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine. The
42:22
old is just fine, they say.
42:27
So the old wine is, first of all, what
42:33
God is doing in his revival right now is so similar to when Jesus first came on this
42:40
earth. um where the Pharisees,
42:46
everyone who were Jews, who were followers of God, they were in old wine.
42:54
And if you don't know what old wine is, new wine is, I teach a lot about a lot a lot on it. You can watch my Revival Army
43:01
training playlist on YouTube. This is where there are foundational teachings
43:06
about the new wine, about what the new wine is. Um, but the old wine is
43:15
just to summarize it. It's like how the Pharisees were acting. The Pharisees were full of religion. They they were
43:22
just all about the outside. They their hearts were not clean, but they were
43:28
like putting on a show trying to appear so great. Um, they cared about how
43:34
people saw them. Um, and they were just doing things to be righteous before God,
43:40
but not being after God's heart. Just doing things just going through the motions instead of genuinely seeking
43:47
after God's heart. And um, with with that with with it all being outward and
43:54
not inside from the inside, their hearts were not godly. Their hearts were not
44:01
having the fruits of the spirit. The hearts would have the opposite of the fruits of the spirit. The hearts would
44:06
have um judgment and pride, jealousy, envy, um and and different things,
44:14
different bitterness, rage, just different aspects
44:20
of uncleanness was in their heart. So um
44:27
Jesus came to bring the new wine and the new wine is so different. And the new wine is what when you really follow the
44:34
new wine way which is the Jesus way which is void of religion. You will cultivate the fruits of the
44:41
Holy Spirit. You will see things differently. You will see people differently. You you
44:47
will live differently. Your you will think differently. You will think like Jesus. You will think like Jesus. Your
44:54
spiritual eyes will open up and you will be like that that just full of love,
45:01
full of light, full of peace, full of joy, full of compassion, full of forgiveness, full of gentleness,
45:08
full of self-control, full of kindness.
45:14
When you come into the new wine, you accept the new wine, you embrace the new wine fully, you reject the old wine
45:19
completely. You don't try to mix it. you will become like Jesus. Hallelujah.
45:26
And so, um, in the new wine is the only place there's going to be peace, joy, and contentment. And so, the new wine is
45:35
the only thing that is delicious. The new wine is
45:40
beautiful. The new wine is true life. The new wine is the real Jesus way.
45:48
But you know, so Jesus is saying in the scripture, no one puts new wine into old
45:54
wine skins. New wine must be stored in new wine skin. So he's saying you can't
45:59
mix it. Like don't come and receive the parts that you like and keep the old
46:04
wine parts that you like because part of the old wine you're a lot of the
46:12
old wine the flesh will like. The flesh, the flesh naturally likes to be prideful. The flesh naturally likes to
46:19
be judgmental. The flesh naturally likes to be selfish. Um
46:24
that's that's the the inclination of the flesh, right? And so
46:31
there are many people in the world today that like they try to come some way into
46:36
the new wine in terms of like um coming to church and reading the Bible and
46:42
worshiping God and serving God and preaching the word of God, preaching
46:47
Jesus, preaching Jesus. So they they try to do some of the new wine like the New
46:53
Testament preaching Jesus preaching. That's that's that's a big part of the new wine is the actual word of God in
47:00
the New Testament, Jesus's words.
47:05
But so so so many times that so many people are like preaching that and they are doing the things instructed but in a
47:12
religious way and then also holding on to parts of the old wine um
47:19
Pharisee like ways. So like trying to be a Pharisee following Jesus basically.
47:25
Uh and Jesus says that won't work. Like it will not work. It will not work. This
47:31
cannot happen. You you can't really be in the new wine holding on to your old
47:36
wine or else you're just in the old wine. You're It can't work. It literally
47:42
can't work. You have to reject the old wine completely. the old wine ways
47:47
completely to really step into the new wine. Um, so then he says, "But no one who
47:55
drinks the old wine," listen, this is this is powerful. "But no one who drinks the old wine," verse 39, Luke 5:39,
48:02
"Seems to want the new wine." No one who drinks the old wine seems to
48:11
want the new wine. The old is just fine. They say
48:22
it's interesting because the new wine is the only place that there's peace and joy. Is the only
48:28
place where there's abundant life, is the only place that's pleasing to God. But Jesus is saying that so many
48:38
don't want the new wine when they're drinking the old wine. the old wine is just fine.
48:44
And that's powerful because it shows us that we really, if we've been in the old wine, if you've been in the old wine,
48:50
you really have to deny your flesh of the old wine. And many times people think crucifying their flesh, denying
48:58
their flesh, they think it means um only like
49:04
things like applying to drinking, applying to swearing, applying to speaking
49:11
negatively, applying to watching TV,
49:16
social media. Those are the areas a lot of people probably think about what it means to
49:24
crucify your flesh, the categories. But a big part of the the area of your
49:31
flesh you need to crucify is the old wine.
49:37
The old wine tendencies, the old wine that you've learned for so long. Um
49:44
because your flesh will say, "I like the old wine."
49:49
Like there may be aspects of your flesh that will be like, "I like the old wine. I like this." And that brings me back to
49:56
my next point about uh I mean what I previously said about you have to be careful who you're listening to and
50:01
watching and even just for a minute on social media because
50:06
your flesh will resonate with what you're seeing. the old wine in someone else, your flesh will resonate with it.
50:14
Your flesh will like it. Your flesh won't see the wrong in it. Um, just like
50:20
the Pharisees, they didn't see the wrong in how they were acting, in what they were doing. They didn't see the wrong in
50:28
it. They liked how they were acting. They liked their old wine. So this
50:35
scripture is really powerful because it shows us that we you really have to crucify your flesh in the old wine. It's
50:43
like you need to protect what you've learned about the new wine and and just
50:48
like remember how good it tastes the new wine. Remember how this is the right
50:55
way. Remember that revelation you've received in different aspects of the new wine when you're like, "Yes,
51:03
this is what I've longed for my whole life." Like, "This is Jesus. This is Jesus."
51:11
You have to protect that cuz there will be some moments where there will be just a temptation to to to
51:20
drink the old wine, to like the old wine. Um, and you got to remember that
51:26
it's the new wine that actually is the only one that tastes good. Is the only
51:33
fulfilling one, the only one that pleases God, the only one that that
51:39
leads to you fulfilling your purpose on this earth. Amen. 2 Corinthians 11:3.
51:48
But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to
51:55
Christ. For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different
52:03
spirit from the spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily
52:09
enough. This is very similar of what I just shared, the revelation I just shared of
52:15
what Jesus was saying about the old wine is just fine. Um, so
52:26
you think about like like Jews that grew up with the the word
52:33
of God. Um some of them they received Jesus but
52:40
that would have been quite a process for them to be transformed to come fully into the new wine. So
52:47
Apostle Paul is speaking here him and other apostles other ministers that are
52:54
in their their ministry which would have been the first disciples called. So he's
52:59
speaking to people who were planted underneath him and he's speaking like what we taught you meaning him and the
53:04
other teaches teachers where they were planted. We taught you um who Jesus is.
53:10
We taught you the Jesus way. We taught you the new wine way. Um and it says for if someone comes to you and preaches a
53:16
Jesus other than the Jesus we preached or if you receive a different spirit from the spirit you received or a different gospel from the one you
53:22
accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
53:28
So he's he's like correct he's correcting them. He's saying um
53:34
you you're not protecting what you've received. You're not remembering the difference the difference between the
53:41
old wine and the new wine. Um and people are preaching a different Jesus like they're preaching a Jesus that's mixed
53:47
with old wine and new wine, but you're putting up with it easily enough. You're you're not seeing
53:54
how it's how it's wrong. you know, you're not you're not staying loyal and devoted to the true gospel that we
54:01
preach to you, Paul's saying here. So all that to say for protecting your
54:07
light, you know, when you come into this, some of you may be brand new here, but many of you you and if you're brand
54:14
new here, I encourage you to go to my revival army training playlist once again on my YouTube. So that because God
54:20
is doing such a a new thing here that as I shared before,
54:26
there's been so much old wine in the body of Christ. um such a lot of like
54:31
religious wrong doctrines and God is pouring out his new wine now. So, make
54:37
sure you go catch up, watch these messages so that you can your eyes can open up and receive this new wine. But
54:44
for those of you that have um received the new wine, have been a
54:51
revival warrior in God's revival army for some time.
54:56
Uh your eyes have opened up to
55:03
the Jesus way, the new wine way. And you have to protect what you have
55:10
received. You have to protect those revelations you had. The revelations you had of,
55:16
"Oh, wow. I was wrong. I was thinking this was right, but I was being religious.
55:22
I was wrong. But now I see this is the right way." Like you have to protect
55:29
those revelations because the enemy will want to try to come in a sneaky way and
55:37
like dress up something of the past of the old wine religious way that you used
55:43
to be or you used to think was right. And um he will try to dress it up and
55:48
make it look good. Like make it look like like make the bottle of wine look
55:54
really beautiful. Make the bottle of old wine look really
56:00
beautiful. It looks like it's going to taste so good when you drink it. You know, the devil can sometimes come in
56:06
that sneaky way where like you already realize the old way, the old wine way
56:11
was wrong, but now he packages that old wine way in a different way, in a
56:18
tempting way. And um to to get you to drink of it because the devil's so
56:24
terrified of you being fully in the new wine because like, man, it's so real out
56:30
there. the the Pharisees of the times of Jesus,
56:36
they were used by the devil. They were used by the devil to try to hinder
56:43
Jesus's ministry, to try to hinder people from receiving Jesus. Um you think about
56:49
the crowd chanting for Jesus to be crucified to in to release um Barabus to release him
56:58
instead of Jesus and for Jesus to be crucified.
57:04
There was this like feisty angry crowd riled up. They got riled up by the
57:09
Pharisees, you know. Um the devil really used those Pharisees and their old wine.
57:16
um he really used them, you know, and so today it's the same thing. It's the same
57:25
thing today. And I'm telling you, I've um over these years, it is always every
57:33
time been Pharisees of today that have done the most damage in terms of trying
57:39
to keep people from seeing the truth, from stepping into the new wine,
57:45
receiving Jesus, receiving healing, receiving freedom. It's always been the Pharisees, you know. So, um,
57:56
when God has called you to to to to be in this new wine and he's called you to be in this
58:01
revival army, the devil knows he sees you as the disciples of Jesus. Okay? And
58:07
so, a believer can either be a disciple of Jesus like the original disciples of Jesus. Okay? You can be that or you can
58:15
be a Pharisee or you can just be giving ears to both
58:25
but not being effective either way,
58:33
standing on the sidelines. But usually if a person's opening up the
58:38
door to to the Pharisee spirit, they will be used in some way. even if it's just a little bit or something to affect
58:46
somebody negatively, you know, speak against the move of God, God's servants, the
58:52
power of God negatively. So
58:58
that's that's an eye openener right there, huh? That's that's whoa, right? Like I I pray the fear of God comes upon
59:04
you all about this reality. Like that's how the devil sees believers.
59:09
Like he sees believers. He's like, I can either use believers as the biggest um
59:16
as my biggest weapon towards the work of God
59:21
or a believer will become will destroy my kingdom and can be used so mightily
59:28
like by God to advance God's kingdom.
59:36
Yeah. So, um, when you when you step into this
59:41
revival, you got to understand like you got to be all in. You got to be all in
59:47
to be like the disciples of Jesus. You got to be all in.
59:52
All in. Or then or it gets dangerous. It can it can get dangerous real quick if
59:58
you're not all in. It can get dangerous just, you know, give an ear, giving an
1:00:04
ear to old wine and giving an ear to Pharisees, you know.
1:00:10
So, um, I share that to say that protecting your light is just so important that you like know what that
1:00:16
means. It's not just like it's not just, you know, making sure you
1:00:22
are keeping peace and joy. It's very important. But just protecting
1:00:28
protecting that new wine, protecting your surrender to Jesus, protecting your
1:00:35
focus on Jesus. Uh uh uh protecting your ears for not to
1:00:41
not be hearing old wine, anything negative, anything
1:00:47
not godly. just putting in precautions to make sure you're guarding your ears and eyes so you're not unintentionally
1:00:55
opening up any door. Um
1:01:02
and uh and I and I now now I I I want to I
1:01:07
want to share the the great importance of protecting your peace and your joy.
1:01:13
Um man, this is so important. This is so important to protect your peace and your
1:01:19
joy because that's that's the light of the world.
1:01:24
That that that is what people need to see. People need to see your light. People need to see you standing strong
1:01:32
in faith in God. That's how people will be drawn to your light. That's how the light overcomes the darkness. Um and so
1:01:39
like like for me personally, you know, God has really convicted me that I must protect my peace and my joy. And I want
1:01:45
to I want to encourage you all to to be leaders to be leaders. The the first
1:01:51
will be last, the last will be first. Like this revival army that God is building, you are truly leaders. And you
1:01:59
don't have to have people submitted under leadership like be over people, you know, be in charge of a group of
1:02:06
people or something to be a leader. People are watching you. People are
1:02:11
watching you, God. The more you shine, the more visible God makes you. The more people are drawn to look at you and to
1:02:18
look at your example and to try to figure out what it is that's different about you, what why you have this light
1:02:24
about you, this peace and joy. You become like under a microscope. You are a leader. You are a leader.
1:02:32
Uh and so you need to see yourself as a leader. You need to see the importance
1:02:38
of standing strong in faith and trusting God and keeping your peace and joy
1:02:43
always. I have to do the verification on Tik Tok now.
1:02:49
Tik Tok makes me do this verification by sliding the puzzle piece and making sure it lines up.
1:02:56
But I have don't have short nails, so sometimes it takes a second. Two tries. This one's two tries. All right. Um,
1:03:05
so people are looking at you that you so you have this important. It's it's so important that you stand strong like I
1:03:12
know I know that I must stand strong in my faith. I must trust God always. Not
1:03:20
just for my sake but for the sake of others. So others can see God is
1:03:26
faithful. God is good. We can trust in him. He knows best. He knows what he's doing. He's in control of the whole
1:03:32
world. He directs the steps of the righteous. He works out all things for good. Romans 8:28. And we know that in
1:03:39
all things, God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. We know that
1:03:46
in all things, every single thing, every single situ situation, circumstance, God
1:03:52
works for the good of those who love him, of those who truly love him from
1:03:58
the heart after his heart genuinely, who have been called according to his
1:04:05
purpose. All things, all things,
1:04:11
all things. Do you know there's also a scripture that says what the enemy intended for
1:04:17
evil, I I intended for good. God intended for good.
1:04:23
Do you know that God is in control? He's not 98% in control, 99% in control.
1:04:30
He's 100% in control. Do you know he's in control of every single day on this earth? He's control of every single
1:04:36
second. He is Lord of the universe. Do you know that the devil has no power over God?
1:04:43
There's not one instance where the devil has power over God. God rules. God
1:04:50
reigns. God is in complete control. Complete.
1:04:57
Complete. Listen to me. He is in complete control. It is not an even battle between the devil and God where
1:05:03
we are watching where we are there watching the battle and cheering on God and like biting our teeth are I mean
1:05:10
biting our fingernails um hoping that God comes through.
1:05:17
Never. Never. You might as well if you're watching the
1:05:22
match between God and the devil, you might as well relax, sit back and know I
1:05:28
know who wins. I he wins every single time. Every single time.
1:05:33
If you can really get this revelation and commit yourself to uh stand on this truth,
1:05:41
you will walk in peace. Your faith will be so big nothing will
1:05:46
shake you. You will keep your light in every
1:05:52
circumstance. And to be humble is to trust God without
1:06:01
understanding. That's to be humble. To trust God without understanding.
1:06:08
Because there's going to be a lot of things that we won't understand. We will not understand. We will not understand
1:06:13
why certain things happen. We will not get it. No matter how many times we try to figure it out, we will never figure
1:06:20
it out. We will never know until we get to heaven. But when you get to heaven, I'm telling
1:06:25
you, you'll be like, "Oh, God,
1:06:36
I'm humbled. Your way is best. I understand now. And man, I wish I just
1:06:44
trusted you without needing to understand in the past because
1:06:50
instead of being worried, depressed, confused, down, heavy day after day, day
1:06:58
after day, I could have just trusted you. I could have just trusted you, relaxed,
1:07:06
relaxed in your goodness, and had peace and joy in every single
1:07:13
circumstance. I'm telling you, we will get to heaven
1:07:20
and a lot of people will have that
1:07:26
that they'll have that they'll have that man I waste I wasted a lot.
1:07:35
I wasted a lot being stressed, being worried, being down, being
1:07:41
depressed because my because me not being able to understand why God allowed
1:07:48
something to led me to I I just I I refused to trust
1:07:55
God and stay focused on him, but I instead
1:08:00
just stayed in this place of confusion.
1:08:07
I want to encourage you to not be one of those people. I want to encourage you to start right now living in that
1:08:13
revelation. I want to encourage you to start living in that revelation that
1:08:19
God's ways are perfect. We won't understand his ways. We'll we'll think in our minds his ways are perfect and
1:08:25
we'll call them bad. You know, we'll think in our way. We'll think in our
1:08:31
mind this way would have been so much better. Why did God do things this way?
1:08:37
But can you humble yourself? Can you humble yourself?
1:08:43
Humble yourself to see that God with to to to remember
1:08:49
this reality that God is the creator of the entire universe. God literally
1:08:56
has a live camera view of every person on this entire earth.
1:09:04
He has a camera view of their hearts, of the intentions of their hearts that are hidden.
1:09:12
He has a live camera view of people's schemes that they're
1:09:17
planning. people's schemes that they're planning, evil schemes. He has a live camera view
1:09:25
of every single person on this earth, what they're doing at every second,
1:09:32
their hearts, the the the things in their hearts that are hidden. He sees
1:09:38
everything. And we who do not have the power to do that over one person, but God has the
1:09:47
power to do to see that. and he sees that for billions of people.
1:09:55
It's so crazy. It's so silly of us. It's so silly for
1:10:00
to put yourself on like to I must understand.
1:10:07
How can we understand some things when God sees everything but yet he doesn't choose to reveal all that he sees to us?
1:10:14
He sees every single person in this world. He sees the devil, what he's planning, what he's doing, his schemes.
1:10:21
He sees the demons. He sees the angels. He He sees literally everything at every
1:10:26
second. How can we understand that? Like how can we understand every single
1:10:32
situation that happens that like God allows cuz he's in control.
1:10:40
So if we can humble oursel to see that it's so beyond us,
1:10:45
it's so beyond us. It's so beyond us. Like certain situations in life that
1:10:51
have this um temptation to
1:10:58
get you to dim your light, right? Um just be like a child. a child, a a
1:11:05
parent, they are dealing with all these issues. They are dealing with all these things. They're making all these decisions. And a little toddler, they're
1:11:11
just playing. They're just they're not wonder what's going on, what mom and dad
1:11:16
are doing, and are we going to have a place to sleep tonight and food to eat? And if we could just be like a child and
1:11:24
just stay focused on what God has called us to do and rest and make it such a priority to guard our heart, protect our
1:11:30
heart. Amen. I want to encourage you to live like a leader. Um, oh, also Romans 12:2,
1:11:40
do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will
1:11:46
is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed to the
1:11:52
renewing of the mind. conform to this world does not mean a lot of people they they're seeing it as um do not conform
1:11:57
to the worldly people, the ways of the worldly people, the sinful ways of the worldly people. But I want to also
1:12:02
encourage you to not conform to the ways of the old wine. Do not conform to the patterns of the
1:12:09
old wine that is popular. Don't conform to it. Renew your mind with what God has
1:12:15
shown you, with what God has revealed you with the new wine, the truth that you desperately yearn for, that you
1:12:20
waited for your whole life. You searched here, there, everywhere. You could never find it. You now found it. Renew your
1:12:26
mind with the preciousness of that. And it didn't happen randomly. It didn't
1:12:32
happen just randomly. It happened when you you encountered God's power and you
1:12:38
planted yourself where God has called you to be and you started to be equipped to be who God called you to be in his
1:12:44
revival army. You embraced and accepted his revival. That's when this came. Philippians 4:8. Finally, brothers and
1:12:51
sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or
1:12:57
praiseworthy, think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or
1:13:03
heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice.
1:13:09
So this is a powerful verse to teach you of how to guard your heart, to protect your light, to keep your mind on
1:13:16
whatever is true, noble, right, pure,
1:13:22
the new wine, lovely, admirable, excellent, praiseworthy. Think about
1:13:29
those things. Don't think about dark things. Don't think about what the patterns of this world are thinking
1:13:35
about. Think about those things. And then Paul says, "Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or
1:13:42
seen in me." So every aspect look carefully listen to
1:13:48
the teachings and how I act and how I speak, what I don't speak, what I speak,
1:13:54
how I conduct myself, how I represent God. Paul is saying,
1:14:02
"Put it into practice and the God of peace will be with you and you will keep
1:14:07
your peace. You will keep your peace when you do these things."
1:14:12
So him as a spiritual father, as a spiritual leader was telling his disciples this.
1:14:18
So um this is such a big important scripture to keep in your heart so that
1:14:24
you are always protecting your light, guarding your heart, protecting the
1:14:29
precious new wine that God has revealed to you,
1:14:35
never going backwards, never letting any of it leave you.
1:14:41
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
1:14:48
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, for your word. I want to encourage all of you to see
1:14:55
yourself as leaders and see the importance of protecting your peace, your joy, and your faith in God.
1:15:03
um and the the fruits of the Holy Spirit,
1:15:09
the new wine that you have received that you would see see yourself as a leader
1:15:16
that you must be shining this light always.
1:15:21
I um when I went through the most persecution
1:15:28
I had ever gone through up to that point um in 2022.
1:15:34
It was brutal. I never imagined the devil would attack in this way through
1:15:40
people. Um it was like fer modern day Pharisee type attacks
1:15:47
publicly. I literally never imagined that would happen. Like I knew that there would be
1:15:54
attacks that the devil would would would would would bring attacks against me
1:15:59
with the calling that I was called to with the influence God was calling me to have. I knew that that would happen, but
1:16:07
it was kind of this general I didn't know what it would look like. I
1:16:12
didn't know what it would look like. I didn't know the disgusting details of the attacks, you know, like. So when
1:16:20
that attack came, woo, it was so shocking. It was I've never seen so much
1:16:25
evil of the devil come at me in my life
1:16:31
by far, like times a million. Like nothing compared to that.
1:16:37
Um, and that happened, that first attack happened, the most brutal attack I've
1:16:43
ever been through in my life. Um, happened the day before I was going to minister.
1:16:52
This was in Louisville, Kentucky. At a 3-day conference, I was ministering every single day. It happened the day
1:16:58
before. It happened as I was on the plane going there. And um
1:17:06
that day, the the next day, I had to minister. And I knew God was calling me to
1:17:18
stand in the truth of what I was standing in every day up till then.
1:17:24
standing in the truth that God is faithful, that God is good, that he is
1:17:30
so good, that we should have peace and joy always,
1:17:35
that when I stand before people and I tell people about God, that I would do it with a smile on my face. That I would
1:17:43
do it with my heart. that I would love people
1:17:50
and a and and and minister with all of my heart and minister like just
1:17:56
that my heart would exhibit the goodness of God, the faithfulness of God,
1:18:04
the the the the the the victory of God, the victory we have in Christ, that my
1:18:10
heart would exhibit that when I ministered. I knew that God was calling me to because I was I went through this
1:18:16
crazy attack. But the truth was is that God was going to use it for good. What the e devil intended for for evil, God
1:18:22
intended it for good. So the truth is is that the that God wasn't sleeping. That
1:18:27
the devil didn't win on this one. No, God will turn it for good. God is still
1:18:33
good. He's still on the throne and his blessings are still pouring over my life. Even though I have to go through
1:18:39
something hard, he's still good. He's still perfect. He's still directing my steps and he the work of God will go on.
1:18:47
The devil came in this biggest attack that I've ever seen to try to stop the work of God. But because God has the
1:18:52
victory always, the work of God's still going to go forth and people are still going to be healed and delivered.
1:18:59
But it's very important that I live in that truth for people to be able to receive
1:19:07
what what what God is moving pouring through me. very important, very
1:19:13
important that I shine my light in the face of darkness
1:19:19
so that God can use me. And so I fought back tears. I went out
1:19:26
there. I I chose to be strong. I chose to be courageous. I chose to put a smile
1:19:33
on my face. I chose to renew my mind that God is good, that God is faithful, that even though I've never seen the
1:19:39
devil attack me in such a way like this and it feels like he's winning, he's not. And the truth of who my God is that
1:19:46
I've always believed remains to be true today. I chose to renew my mind of that and
1:19:54
believe that truth. I chose to believe that truth and I chose to minister in
1:20:00
that truth.
1:20:07
And I share that because you are a lead. This is this was my job as a leader to
1:20:13
be a light to lead others to Jesus. And you are called to the same thing. Even
1:20:18
if it's one person observing you, one person that you're interacting with, that you would act in the same way,
1:20:26
that you wouldn't allow yourself to be shaken so that your light can shine so brightly
1:20:33
still and and penetrate through all the darkness. That's your calling.
1:20:40
That's your calling, revival warriors. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
1:20:47
Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. We are going to
1:20:52
transition onto the Zoom call right now. And so if you can if you can if you want to go to the comments section on my
1:20:57
Facebook and YouTube um you can click on the link there and it'll take you to the
1:21:02
Zoom call.
1:21:17
There's space for 500, but those of you that um don't get in there in the the
1:21:24
500, God will still move just as powerfully through the screen as you are
1:21:30
watching this live stream. Amen. Hallelujah.
Miracles on Zoom
1:22:37
All right, welcome Welcome everybody on the Zoom call. Hello everyone. It's such a blessing to see all of your faces.
1:22:43
Welcome. Welcome. Hallelujah. Um more are coming into the Zoom call right now.
1:22:49
I'm just going to give it some time for everyone to join us. Thank you Jesus.
1:22:55
Thank you Lord for all that you will do through this Zoom call and through this live stream.
1:23:01
Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:23:09
For all of you in the Zoom call, I just want to share some protocols, some rules.
1:23:15
One rule is that you have your video, your camera on because this is how the Holy Spirit leads me to pick on a person
1:23:23
is by seeing your face. So, make sure your video's on. if you don't turn your video on, if you can just make space in
1:23:29
the Zoom call, if you can remove yourself and just watch the live stream so that more people can come in that want to have their video on. And um
1:23:37
also, no one uh if if you should not be hitting the um raise your hand button
1:23:44
button. First of all, I'm not even paying attention to that. I've even just trained my mind to not even look at that
1:23:50
because I'm just looking at your faces and that is who I am calling. That's how
1:23:57
the Holy Spirit leads me to call in someone, not by the raising your hand button alert. So, please do not press
1:24:04
that because it's distracting because it shows up as like a notification thing. So, please make sure you don't press
1:24:10
that or you'll be removed. So, that because it's important we have order. It's important that there's no
1:24:15
distractions. All right. Thank you, Jesus.
1:24:22
Thank you, Lord. All right. There's still some room in the Zoom the Zoom
1:24:28
meeting. If anyone else wants to join, we still have some room.
1:24:33
We're almost to 500. Thank you, Lord.
1:24:48
I want to encourage everyone of you that's on the Zoom call and everyone of you that's watching live. I want to encourage you right now to prepare your
1:24:55
hearts to receive from God. I want to encourage you to just surrender to Jesus right now. Um some of you God has been
1:25:02
speaking to you through the message. There's things that he's convicted you of that he wants you to surrender to him right now. To repent of and surrender
1:25:09
surrender to him. Some of you maybe have not taken it seriously, protecting your heart and guarding your light. And so
1:25:19
just surrender that to Jesus right now. Commit to that. Make this covenant with Jesus that you will commit to guarding
1:25:25
your heart. You will take it so so so seriously. Uh, and I just also want to
1:25:31
encourage anyone if you have any kind of demonic oppression or sickness to specifically renounce those things
1:25:37
because renouncing meaning to say, "I renounce addiction. I renounce anxiety."
1:25:44
Whatever it is, when you do that, it's one of the keys that unlocks your deliverance. Because there is such power
1:25:51
when you take authority over the devil. When you say, "I," it's the action of you saying, "I don't want the devil's
1:25:57
portion in my life. I only want God's will. It's the action of you kicking the
1:26:03
devil out and then when the power of God comes, the anointing after you have done
1:26:09
that, the demons have to flee. Hallelujah.
1:26:14
Thank you, Jesus.
1:26:26
So I want to speak over everybody right now who is watching, everyone on the Zoom call and everyone watching on the
1:26:31
live stream right now. I want to pray over you all right now. I see God right
1:26:37
now just removing all heaviness because
1:26:42
there's areas in your life where you've allowed your light to ooze out. You've
1:26:48
allowed your joy or your peace to ooze out from not guarding your heart. And so right now, I speak all heaviness to go.
1:26:56
Everything that entered you from not guarding your heart, I declare it to go from you, to be lifted off you now. I
1:27:03
speak all depression must go. I speak all darkness must go. I speak all of
1:27:10
these thoughts that have come in your mind recently of fear. It must go now in Jesus' name.
1:27:18
And I speak right now there to be just this exposure of anything that you have
1:27:25
allowed that wasn't from God. You've allowed yourself to listen to, to look
1:27:31
at, to intake, to think about, to to say amen to, to to really take it in.
1:27:38
Anything that was not of God, anything that was old wine, anything that was a different Jesus,
1:27:45
a different Jesus, like how Paul said, you you accepted a different Jesus so
1:27:52
easily. May that go from you now in Jesus' name.
1:27:57
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
1:28:06
Hallelujah.

1:41:24
deliverance and there is so much work here but people of Slovakia don't speak
1:41:30
English much. I'm sure you have seen like you have prayed for many people from Slovakia but in general Slovaks
1:41:36
don't speak English. So even if we share your messages on our social media or in
1:41:42
our ministry when we share messages it has to be in Sloanguage because when we share don't understand.
1:41:49
Yes. I have even many friends in my age group and they don't speak English. They speak
1:41:55
rather German than English and then it's it's very difficult to share the messages with them.
1:42:01
Yeah. So we are just praying for for people and we just hope for some kind of
1:42:08
breakthrough even for us because we have two children and they were diagnosed with autism and it's so difficult to you
1:42:15
know testify to people that really God is good and and and he's true and he's
1:42:21
alive and he's still healing and delivering when we ourselves are struggling so much.
1:42:26
It's really difficult but yeah still we believe God uses us still. Yeah. And
1:42:31
we believe God is in still in control. Amen.
1:42:37
Amen. Well, I believe right now that God is going to move in power and bring healing to your children.
1:42:44
I believe Yes. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. I break every generational curse
1:42:51
now in Jesus' name. And I declare every
1:42:56

anything that they are having trouble doing in their mind, in their body, it
1:43:09

1:43:15
excellence in every area in their mind. Let they h let them have the mind of

together, uh we actually horse before Joe. It's a long story. Uh when we came together, it was immediate spiritual
2:09:19
warfare. Um we read your book, we got your book, the Lord delivered both of us from a lot me from rage, anger, a lot of
2:09:27
a lot of different things like lust, pride, greed, porn. Um wow.
2:09:32
Her, you know, just a lot of pain from her past. We both had a lot of carried a lot of pain from pasties and stuff like
2:09:38
that. Um uh we both went through a lot when we came together.
2:09:44
her children's father and the girlfriend basically took her kids from her. Uh we
2:09:49
haven't even been able to see him and it's been nothing but warfare. Uh stagnancy the enemy's attacked us are he
2:09:57
he hasn't really got to our marriage because we literally pray all day every day. you and a few others that we've
2:10:03
watched have really increased the fire and the desire to really go after the Lord in prayer because the church at at
2:10:10
large is asleep and the Lord has reawakened us. Um the Lord will wake us
2:10:16
both up at night like 2 or 3 in the morning just we'll just pray till we go back to sleep. Um we've been faced
2:10:22
warfare coming against our finances and then the children custody. Um we both look like a bunch of idiots in court. uh
2:10:29
we had to represent ourselves and so it's been tough. There's there's a lot
2:10:34
more tuck I'm leaving out but we need uh we're just really just
2:10:40
walking by faith. We're just following the Holy Spirit. We love your ministry
2:10:45
uh watching you. We would love to come to LA and see you. But you know finances um and I'm also I just went back into
2:10:53
law enforcement. I've been in law enforcement for almost a decade now. will be this year and I just got out of
2:10:58
the military. Um, so I just want more of the fire, the Holy Spirit, impartation,
2:11:04
anointing because I come across the worst of the worst and see the worst worse. The ones who are broken, are hurting, addicted, full of demons. You
2:11:12
can see it. And then really for the Lord to save her ex. We've already received
2:11:17
prophecy that he will be snatched from the kingdom of darkness to save and set free um and restore the children to us
2:11:23
and all the lost time, finances, resources, everything the enemy got away with when it came to the custody stuff.
2:11:31
Um and everything else in between. Romans 8:28 has been since we came
2:11:36
together our life thirst. We just been standing on God's word and his truth. It's been tough, but you at least
2:11:42
faithful. So, well, I know that God has brought you here right now in this moment
2:11:49
as a divine appointment to release his power upon you both to break all of
2:11:57
these strongholds of the enemy because I see that I see that you both were
2:12:03
called. You were called. You are special. You are set apart. You are different from others. And I see you are
2:12:10
called to be revival warriors, leaders like like like you
2:12:17
have a a different heart and God is calling you to be leaders in his revival
2:12:22
in terms of like so many people coming into the truth because of your example,
2:12:29
you know, but that's what I mean. I I I don't I'm not like speaking specific callings or anything, but I'm just seeing right now that he has called you
2:12:36
to be set apart and that many will follow your example. And so what I say
2:12:42
right now, what I see right now is God is I see the devil is terrified of of of
2:12:47
what will take place through you when nothing is holding you back. And that's why he's tried. But right now, it's time
2:12:54

2:42:25
if you have not gotten my book, Unlock Your Deliverance or Secret of the Anointing, that's that that was my first
2:42:32
book and this is my second book. Uh, in this book, I teach you how to be free,
2:42:38
completely free from all demonic oppression and how to walk in abundant life. So this is a must for everybody
2:42:44
because most people are not walking in abundant life. Most people have some sort of bondage or sickness. And so I
2:42:50
reveal the keys in the spiritual realm of how to unlock complete freedom and abundant life. And in this book, the
2:42:55
secret of the anointing, I teach you how to access the power of God to be an anointed vessel of God. Because the
2:43:02
Bible says all who believe these signs shall follow them. Some of these signs are they shall cast out demons. They shall lay hands on the sick and be
2:43:08
healed. And so many people are not accessing God's power. They don't know how to access God's power. They don't
2:43:14
know what God is looking for when he's looking to pour out his anointing in a vessel. And so, I share these secrets
2:43:21
here in this book. And I also have an ecourse that pairs with this book called Walking in Miracles, teaching you more
2:43:29
in depth of how to be an anointed vessel of God, carrying God's power and walking in his miracles. Um, also this uh
2:43:37
yesterday, yesterday uh we have the Spanish
2:43:42
translation of Unlock Your Deliverance. It came out. You can order it online at various bookstores. Amazon was sold out
2:43:49
already yesterday, but I believe you can still order. Um, they're just out of stock. I They might be in stock today.

aware that there are many impersonators of me. If you're new here, listen up. There are many impersonators of me,
2:45:18
people who impersonators who try to scam people, pretending to be me on social media. So, please be aware of them. The
2:45:24
easiest way to know that it's my account is um by looking at the follower count.
2:45:31
On Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Tik Tok, I have more than 200,000 followers
2:45:38
or subscribers. All of the scammers will have way less than that. So, that's the easiest way to know. My ex is Katherryn
2:45:46
Crick. That's the only exception. It has less than 200,000, but it's Katherryn Crick. Um, and I will never DM you
2:45:54
sharing a prophetic message that you need to sew to an orphanage or something or sew somewhere. That's not me. That's
2:46:01
what the scammers do. I do not reply to your comments on my posts saying, "I
2:46:07
want to talk to you more. Message me here." That's what the scammers do. Um, I do not have an email, Gmail, WhatsApp,
2:46:13
Telegram. I do not video call ever. If you're getting a video call from me, it's not me. Um,
2:46:20
and what you think is me is not me is what I mean if it's if you're getting a video call. Um, I do not have any
2:46:27
Facebook groups, just page. No groups. There's many, many, many groups that are
2:46:32
all run by impersonators. So, if you're part of a Facebook group, you should remove yourself because it's an
2:46:39
impersonator. Um, and yeah, oh, also be aware of AI like um, you know, with the
2:46:47
voice, they can they can make things sound like my voice. So, I will not be sending you audio messages, okay? That
2:46:54
would be a scammer. All right? So, let anyone you know, if you share my ministry with anybody, please just let
2:46:59
them give them a heads up. Uh, the only way to give to my ministry is at 5church.org/give.
2:47:07
That's the only way to give. Um, and my personal website is apostle
2:47:13
kathnancick.com. Um, that's also the only way to book me
2:47:18
to to to book me to speak at an event, for example, is apostle cathick.com
