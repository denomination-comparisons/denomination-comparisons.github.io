people hearing about what's happening hearing about the miracles and them coming and traveling to come to your
44:49
church just like they do here people will travel to come and receive freedom
44:54
and healing thank you Jesus i release more of this anointing upon you let this
45:00
revival increase and let the anointing increase more in Jesus name with every
45:05
day revival is now [Applause]
45:15
Mexico [Applause] hallelujah
45:22
mexico hallelujah hallelujah
45:29
hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise
45:36
God god bless you thank you for sharing wow praise God praise God
45:43
pastors pastors here pastors watching online ministers this anointing is for
45:49
you it is not for just me it is not just for a handful of people this anointing
45:55
is for you but but but the way to receive it is the narrow road it's the
46:00
narrow road that a lot of people don't want to go it's not difficult it's not difficult to go on the narrow road but
46:06
this narrow road involves dying to your ego and getting rid of the pride and
46:14
humbling yourself humbling yourself to see I don't have the anointing that
46:22
destroys the yolks i don't have the anointing that makes demons go and the sick be healed i need that anointing and
46:30
so I humble myself to and I come in line with God's main way of releasing
46:38
anointing from a vessel who's carrying the the anointing already who becomes a
46:44
spiritual mother or father to release that anointing to you and to equip you
46:50
in how to walk in the anointing in a way that pleases God and in in God's order
46:56
amen so it involves you humbling yourself and saying "I don't have it all
47:02
i need the anointing." But but God lifts the humble
47:07
god lifts the humble so you have to go down but when you go down God raises you up he raises you up higher than you were
47:15
before for his glory you can't fake the anointing you
47:21
can't contrive the anointing and so people won't see you as something that
47:26
carries something they need until you have the anointing he li he lifts you for for his glory he will increase your
47:34
ministry he will bless your ministry he will make it so much bigger and make it to be revival there he will lift you and
47:40
give you honor for his glory but you have to go down first you have to humble
47:47
yourself first it is worth it hallelujah it is worth it to die to yourself
47:54
completely to die to your ego it is worth it pastors it is worth it
48:01
ministers i'm ready to release this to you god's ready to release this to you
48:07
through me this is my calling this is my calling like like like like like Elijah
48:14
was he did not complete his calling until he released the mantle the
48:20
impartation of anointing to Elisha moses did not complete fulfill his
48:26
calling until he released the impartation of anointing to
48:32
Joshua paul did not complete his calling until he released the anointing to
48:37
Timothy and his other spiritual children this is God's way this is God's way so I
48:45
am here as an apostle to equip and to cast out demons and to heal the sick but just as much as that I am also called to
48:51
impart and to release what I have to pastors to ministers and to all children of God
48:58
so I just want to say that if nobody knows that listen to this testimony you know as proof if if people don't know
49:06
that cuz maybe it's it's rare today i want to announce that that I'm here ready to freely give what I freely
49:13
receive to pastors and ministers and I want to cheer you on i
49:20
want to unite with your church you know as the members of the body I want to cheer on your ministry and your
49:27
church i want this revival to spread there i don't want this revival to just be in LA to just be at my ministry i
49:35
want this revival to be in your church in your ministry hallelujah
49:42
hallelujah this is God's heart this is my heart so the way is not to be
49:49
separate the way is not to compete and compare and be jealous and push others
49:56
down to try to lift yourself up this is the God godly way to unite and
50:02
to to cheer each other on and to release what we have to those who don't have if
50:08
they will humble themselves hallelujah
50:15
hallelujah and I speak this even for those who have tried to push me down
50:20
tried to step on me to lift themselves i speak that to even
50:26
you like if you are like Saul right now I want you to be Paul and I want to be
50:32
like Ananas who opened Paul's eyes i want to release the anointing to you
50:39
really I'm ready to release this to you not compete but to give and cheer you
50:45
on hallelujah hallelujah this is the Jesus way
50:53
this is the Jesus way the the the way of God we read about through Elijah and Moses the Jesus way we read about as he
51:01
says "You will do the things I do and greater receive what I have go and do what I've done." This is the Jesus way
51:07
that we see in Apostle Paul this is what's being restored in this revival
51:13
the heart of purity and unity hallelujah praise God hallelujah
51:21
thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus wow
51:26
hallelujah ah praise God i recognize you with the black hair and the black shirt
51:32
can you come up [Applause]
51:46
here i just posted your testimony recently is that right
51:51
hallelujah praise God yes you know praise God you know some not everyone
51:57
watches all the videos so I want you to share this testimony with everyone here
52:02
yes so I was a Christian my whole life and just what you just said it's so
52:08
powerful and we all need it i was a Christian my whole life with pastors
52:15
without power and I suffered my children suffered and it has
52:21
to stop we cannot continue with religion without the power the power is
52:28
here and it's undeniable it's it's here and and I'm a
52:34
mother and my children at one time we were all depressed i actually was
52:40
suicidal a lot of people don't know that but God set me free i have a picture
52:46
here and I have another testimony so I came to Flourish LA like I said in the
52:52
testimony and um you know I knew the devil was going
52:57
to come with um confusion and to try to say that uh you know things about you so
53:04
what I did was I said when I saw you I came to LA you were announcing flourish
53:10
for the first time and um I said I have to go and God said go and I came and I
53:15
was at them up there at the other and I was watching and I could not and I was
53:21
so grieved because I we were all missing out on this and you needed to come you
53:27
needed to come you needed to come and I was so desperate i was so
53:35
desperate and I said I left and I have not been able to do a testimony because
53:41
I've been a disciple i emptied myself and I humbled myself and I said God I
53:48
want to love her because I knew the devil would come to try to tell me that you know you were with religion i had so
53:55
much religion i'm 51 i had 51 years of religion so although I I've never done
54:02
any drugs alcohol you know nothing i was a good Christian girl but I was full of
54:08
culture church culture and church ways and habits and fasting i once fasted i
54:14
got so skinny 59 days i don't know why I didn't make it to 60 i mean I got so
54:19
[Applause] skinny i And um I I I don't remember i don't think I
54:27
had the energy and I was sick i was oppressed i was depressed i came to my
54:34
my rope when I said "I'm going to I'm going to do something really crazy if you don't help me Lord." And um God he
54:41
showed up in my room my mom helped me you know you say we're not supposed to get delivered on our own but God's mercy
54:47
and grace he did deliver me from depression and then I started reading the Bible with an uncction of anointing
54:54
and then he was preparing me for you so that I would receive you and so that
55:00
I would be a testimony i suffered for 51 years well 50 until I saw you so this is
55:07
vital like this isn't a joke if children are dying your own children and you call yourself a Christian stop stop it's not
55:15
about pride you got to humble yourself you got to come you got to boldly say "I stand for Jesus not religion i stand for
55:22
the power of the Lord i need it i need it i need it i need it i need
55:27
it we need it necessamos i'm saying we need in Spanish
55:35
because I had a lot of cultural Spanish cultural ways you know and um it it it's
55:41
part of the religion you know and so um I'm here to say after I came to LA I it
55:48
I took off i took off but I said I want to love her like I want to love her and
55:54
I kept saying that and the enemy tried like little things to look for little things that you would say and and I so
56:01
easily I could reject but it was because of what you teach it was my IV drip daily even till today I don't care where
56:08
I'm working at I go I'm at Costco I leave that can wait like if people would
56:14
take it this way you would be set free so quickly and I can say I I was set
56:20
free from religion so Um LA to um Arise
56:25
and Shine was about a year flourish to Arise and Shine yeah right flourish to
56:31
Arise and Shine was about a year apostle I just closed on a million-doll
56:37
property i'm I'm not lacking in any financial way um my children are all set
56:43
free and we are living from glory to glory but I This is not a flex this is
56:48
This is what Jesus does i was a business woman
57:02
amen i'm I'm not married you know and I'm not looking but I'm not married but
57:08
the the point is like um when this property came along when you said that so so apostle you I went from ministry
57:15
to ministry and listening to all these prophecies and I would say okay well nothing happened you prophesy and I see
57:22
it you say and I walk in it so you are my prophet and my pastor and my leader
57:29
and I and you say and I do and it happens and I didn't know it could be
57:34
this easy i did not know and a lot of people in religion they're waiting 15 20
57:39
years i thought that was the way i didn't know i did not know and then I follow your principles super seriously
57:47
if there's something that kind of you say this all the time if something kind of irks you or you I don't like that
57:53
okay check it out there's a weakness there get strong in it um for me was
57:59
judgment i didn't know that's a form of pride you know I'm picking on you well what you know and so that was like my
58:06
biggest thing and so um you know that's where it can hide and so I just look for
58:12
whatever could be a weak spot to get strengthened in it um and that's that's
58:18
my testimony i just closed on this um after a shine this gave this gave us so
58:24
many problems because I'm not considered an investor and um there were se this a David and Goliath kind of story because
58:32
um so many investors had cash and I they came to me the seller was like I had favor and so another thing I want to say
58:40
huge is the covering the covering is so important it's so important you know to
58:46
be a lone wolf yeah I could hear a little bit when God started opening my eyes but it is nothing like being under
58:53
under you under this anointing and I honor you i love you and I love God for giving me this love for you and I maybe
59:00
I suffer but it's good because I can be a testimony so come come to where the glory is come to where the anointing is
59:08
be set free your children can be set free of Yes yes yes um so um one of my
59:18
sons we were all Christians and bonded up and um one of my son uh vaped picked
59:25
up vaping until I found out and then you know it was hard nicotine is hard um and
59:31
and don't be afraid to grab on to somebody i remember a young lady here Wendy she testified she's from New
59:38
Jersey and she testified that she was uh able to be set free deliver from vape
59:44
vaping and um I I held on to it i am unashamed i will I will do anything for
59:51
Jesus and um I I saw her and I started crying and you know I brought my son to
59:58
uh the one in New York flourish New York yes i brought him he was set free a
1:00:03
month later yeah it works it doesn't matter if your
1:00:09
kids you're the authority figure in your home you're the mother and so I claim and I stand firm for my children and
1:00:16
there is no lack my children are not in any of that my son is happy i've seen the joy i even asked Anthony "Anthony
1:00:23
you look so joyous." And he goes "Yeah mom i have this joy it's like I'm a kid again he's 26 he's my youngest boy." And
1:00:31
yeah and me I've been set free from so many things i even had a crooked nose
1:00:36
from playing basketball god fixed my nose so you can get a nose job
1:00:41
yeah it was crooked and I never had it fixed yeah and it's fake
1:00:47
yeah i can see it looks straight wow wow and what else are we afraid of um just
1:00:55
you know mental torment condemnation the old wine i didn't even know it was the old wine i didn't even know it it was
1:01:03
like you know old mindset old thinking that is so strong you know I love it
1:01:09
when you say that somebody like for example like April like she was never really in the old wine so she was set
1:01:16
free in like three months and it's almost like this religion can grab such
1:01:21
a hold on you so horribly that it's better to not even be in it because to
1:01:27
be just fresh right yeah because the stronghold I had to fight so I did it
1:01:33
and I Oh it was really beautiful at Arise and Shine um I noticed that I
1:01:41
hadn't closed on this property yet and I said "I don't care i'm going." I told everybody "I'm going." And they were like "We're in the middle of something."
1:01:47
I'm like "Well I had plaint tickets because I have to go to this conference." And so you know give God
1:01:53
the the priority and I did and I came with my daughter and then I realized
1:01:59
that I had grown so much and then you said it yourself i see a lot of people
1:02:04
set free i see a lot of people you've grown and my eyes weren't really open until then like I was like "Oh my god I
1:02:10
have grown i am so much stronger." You know it's the teachings it's the equipping it's everything it's I do
1:02:17
subscriber live i read the books i buy the books you know everything uh
1:02:22
miracles the the course that you have the ecourse and so that's what I say you
1:02:28
know if you really are serious and you want to be really set free you can quickly um just you know be connected
1:02:34
and I have so much zeal and so much fire can you tell praise
1:02:41
God praise God hallelujah
1:02:47
hallelujah praise God wow jesus wow praise God rue and
1:02:54
Chanel [Applause]
1:03:10
hallelujah praise God i just wanted
1:03:15
to welcome our 5F family from Toronto
1:03:22
Canada wow god moves so powerfully and I thank you for being powerful seeds in
1:03:27
your city that is leading to a great revival in in Toronto hallelujah and I
1:03:35
wanted to have you up here and for you could for you to testify a little bit ru you have just become plant you've been
1:03:41
planted for four years this week at 5F Church hallelujah
1:03:47
and I remember um when revival first broke out it was um like when the first
1:03:54
demon was cast out in March uh at Five Old Church in the park March 21st
1:03:59
2021 that's when really revival started to break out in person and online it was
1:04:05
already breaking out online uh in January when a video went viral and many
1:04:11
miracles thousands of thousands of miracles God did on that video on that one minute video um so it was already
1:04:17
starting online January i think you found it may you found 5F Church and I
1:04:23
remember you know I would be preaching live i would be not just Sunday services but like doing live streams where I'd be
1:04:29
looking I could see the comments and I remember Rue commenting every single
1:04:35
live stream from May four years ago and I remember seeing back in May "Wow I
1:04:42
love this girl's fire for God i love her passion for what God is doing this is so
1:04:47
beautiful this was before I really knew that God wanted to have people planted
1:04:53
at 5F Church from all over the world even if they didn't live in LA this is before I even knew God was going to do
1:05:00
this so I remember seeing you and just you know you were like this seed of
1:05:05
people being planted from around the world and you became planted just like that pretty much in May right four years
1:05:12
ago happy four year anniversary of being planted hallelujah and so I just wanted I wanted
1:05:20
you to share um they're both planted chanel and R are both planted from Toronto so they're watching online every
1:05:27
week from Toronto um and how long have you been planted online
1:05:32
three years in September wow so I just want you to share briefly you can share also what you have been free of but I
1:05:39
also want you to share your testimony of being planted because this is something that a lot of people are not aware of
1:05:46
that you can be planted from afar um but the power of being planted where God's
1:05:51
power is and where he's calling you to be planted many people don't know the power of that so I want you to encourage
1:05:58
even your your fellow Canadians watching and everyone around the world i just
1:06:04
want you to share your testimony of being planted you've only been in person only like one or two three times per
1:06:09
year right not but you're you're receiving online always yes yes it's
1:06:15
it's been such a blessing to to be able to watch online you know i mean like my
1:06:20
whole life has been transformed um and just the anointing it really moves through the screen and and touches you
1:06:27
wherever you are like I've been delivered just watching online even replays even when I first um found like
1:06:34
when I first watched your testimony it was a replay that I was watching it wasn't like live I I had just come home
1:06:40
from work and um you know I didn't know much about you your ministry but I knew
1:06:45
like I was drawn to hear your story and so I just was watching a replay and the
1:06:52
power of God hit me in my room it's like and in that moment my eyes opened up to
1:06:58
what God was doing and you know like the voices in my head like the voices of
1:07:03
shame sin and and everything like the enemy was like doing in my mind it it
1:07:09
was completely silenced in that moment and then I just knew like God was doing something so powerful my eyes opened up
1:07:15
and immediately like I was like I have to continue to come i have to continue to watch online because I'm receiving
1:07:22
freedom i'm receiving deliverance i'm receiving what Jesus wants for me and so I just continued to to watch the lives
1:07:29
and you were going live that time like three week three times a week at that point and so I even like I tr I traveled
1:07:36
to um Ghana West Africa and I was still watching um and I was receiving so much
1:07:42
more deliverance and even baptized in the Holy Spirit like again because I was
1:07:47
so lukewarm and even when I encountered Jesus at a young age I went into the
1:07:52
world and I was so lukewarm and double-minded and I strayed away from from God but I wanted to surrender so
1:07:59
much to Jesus but because of all the oppression and all the open doors that I had opened in the world it was like I
1:08:05
was it was hard for me to surrender to to God and um so I just knew that I had
1:08:11
to continue to plant myself and to keep coming and every time he would speak I would receive more revelation and the
1:08:17
the lies of the enemy were exposed and that my eyes opened up to the truth like "Wow Jesus Jesus's love is so real and
1:08:24
his power is so real." And you know I I was just transformed every daily just
1:08:29
watching daily and it just became like you know I don't know it just became so
1:08:35
like my number one priority to just be on the live like everything else came second and and I just continue to to
1:08:43
watch and I was filled with the same fire that you were you were you had because I was receiving online and you
1:08:49
know I just became so passionate about what God was doing through your ministry and so you know it was just um it's just
1:08:56
it's just so so amazing how God has really transformed my life to like now be in his will and like now he's using
1:09:03
my life to like bring to bring him so much glory you know and I just want to thank you for you know allowing me to
1:09:10
use my life to bring God glory and like to walk in like my calling to be a vessel of God and you know just do his
1:09:18
will so yeah that's glory to God glory to God
1:09:25
hallelujah hallelujah and Chanel would you like to
1:09:30
share yeah so for me um I started to watch Apostle in like March of 2022 but
1:09:38
I officially planted myself in on September 7th of 2022 and when I would
1:09:43
tune into the live streams I noticed right away that her message they weren't just messages they were anointed they
1:09:49
were prophetic it was exactly what I needed to hear every single week and I
1:09:56
used to deal with so much religion and condemnation from the devil i thought that that was how God was i thought he
1:10:03
was this condemning God that I thought I had to be perfect and do certain religious acts for him to be proud of me
1:10:10
and through the teachings of Apostle Katherine the lies of the devil were exposed
1:10:17
[Applause]
1:10:22
and I just never seen such purity in a
1:10:28
minister like Apostle i noticed right away when I seen you there was so much
1:10:34
purity and I was like "Wow this is a true servant of God." And I stand by
1:10:40
Apostle Katherine she's a true servant of God that God is using in this end time revival i don't care what no one
1:10:47
says i don't care what no Pharisee [Applause]
1:10:54
says i don't care what any Pharisee says because if anyone would actually listen
1:11:00
to her journey she went through four and a half years of waiting and the pruning
1:11:05
and the process it didn't just come to her naturally she the her biggest fear and weakness was preaching and look at
1:11:12
her now so many so many lives have been changed
1:11:20
i have been changed i used to deal with um demons that would attack me sexually in the night and I'm completely free of
1:11:26
[Applause] that and I'm just I'm on fire like yo I
1:11:35
could not speak like this two years back there's no way the first time the first time that I ever uh spoke was on baptism
1:11:43
that was the first time I ever came to a 5F Sunday service in person and I could barely speak and now I don't know what's
1:11:49
happening how I'm speaking like [Applause]
1:11:58
this like at Revival Now Toronto i was so nervous i was three we were getting ready and I was nervous but as soon as I
1:12:04
stepped on stage I just felt the fire of God come upon me and it's like all those nerves just lifted off just like Dave
1:12:10
was like I'll fight him i'll share my testimony i'll speak in front of over a
1:12:16
thousand people even though I've never done that before and I just honor you mama so much
1:12:22
my life has changed completely i'm not the same person that I was it'll be three years now and just my character
1:12:30
the the words that you bring it brings trans transformation in the heart and that's what's most important it's the
1:12:37
it's the purity of heart and you have such a pure heart mama and I love you so much it's it's an honor to serve
1:12:46
you i love you so much ma you are so rare and precious and I just thank you
1:12:53

1:15:54
message is great faith god is God is calling you all to
1:16:03
have a great faith to have a greater faith than you currently have it's time
1:16:09
right now to rise up with a greater faith that will please God and lead to
1:16:14
many miracles in your life amen hebrews 11:6 "And it is impossible to
1:16:22
please God without faith." Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that
1:16:29
God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him
1:16:38
so you must if you want to step into the kingdom of heaven receive the miracles
1:16:44
the blessings the abundant life that God has in store for you as a part of your inheritance as a child of God you must
1:16:52
have faith you must have faith that God
1:16:59
exists but also there's a greater meaning of faith than just believing in
1:17:04
God in that God exists but believing in all that he is and all that he has so
1:17:12
all that God is is full of love and no condemnation
1:17:17
always full of love and you have to believe that so when there's other things going on in
1:17:24
your mind you have you have a choice to make what will you believe the lies that
1:17:29
God is condemning you or the truth that God is for you and loves you always no
1:17:37
matter what even if you've fallen down even if you've made a mistake you have to make that choice of
1:17:43
what you will believe you You have to believe that God
1:17:49
is all that he is that he is full of love and mercy and compassion
1:17:55
he he he he understands what you're going through he has this compassion for
1:18:00
you and his love is beyond any love you've ever experienced in this earth you have to have that faith in who he is
1:18:09
that's what it talks about and when it's meaning you can't please God without
1:18:14
faith it's so important you have that faith in your heart to be able to receive from God and to please him you
1:18:21
also have to have faith in what God does god brings healing to those who are sick
1:18:29
by his stripes we are healed god destroys the works of the devil
1:18:36
his anointing destroys every yoke he casts out demons of addiction and anxiety and depression infirmities
1:18:44
generational curses witchcraft impure sexual spirits he casts them all out
1:18:49
that's what he does that's what he wants to do in your life you have to believe
1:18:54
that that's the meaning of faith in God hallelujah but you also need to have
1:19:03
faith that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him so that means you
1:19:08
have to have this belief that he wants to bless you he wants to take you glory
1:19:14
to glory he wants to bring you abundant life he wants to take you higher than
1:19:19
where you are now for his glory
1:19:24
you have to believe that the best days are ahead of you you have to believe that the promise he
1:19:30
has spoken to you will come to pass no matter what it's looking like right now
1:19:36
you need to believe that he has greater in store for you and these miracles will take place and these promises will come
1:19:42
to pass hallelujah so that's the meaning of faith to summarize it and we cannot
1:19:49
please God without faith the most important thing for us to do on this earth is to please God amen nothing else
1:19:55
should matter it's very simple very simple that should that should be our heart every day i want to please God if that can be your heart if that could be
1:20:01
your intention you will be in God's will you will have faith that releases
1:20:08
miracles you will see the promises come to pass you will have victory over the devil you will resist every temptation
1:20:15
if you can simply make that your greatest intention your greatest passion
1:20:21
your greatest mission and goal every day i want to please God i must please God
1:20:28
it's very simple hallelujah so we cannot please God
1:20:34
without faith because God is in the realm of faith everything that comes from the
1:20:40
kingdom is based on faith and and and and and God wants us to we
1:20:46
we God wants us to receive from him to receive from him we have to have faith
1:20:52
god wants to use you as a vessel in order to be a vessel you have to have faith there's no other
1:20:59
way so to do what God wants you to do on this earth and to receive what he wants
1:21:05
you to receive so you can be a light to the world you have to have faith that's why
1:21:13
you can't please God without faith so to please God is to have faith
1:21:22
so your priority needs to be to please God every day and just as much to keep
1:21:30
your faith alive hallelujah
1:21:38
matthew 8:5 As Jesus went into Capernaum a
1:21:44
centurion came up to him begging him for help and saying "Lord my my servant is
1:21:50
lying at home paralyzed with intense and terrible tormenting pain." Jesus said to
1:21:55
him "I will come and heal him." But the centurion replied to him,"Lord I am not
1:22:01
worthy to have you come under my roof but only say the word and my servant
1:22:06
will be healed for I also am a man subject to authority of a higher rank
1:22:11
with soldiers subject to me and I say to one "Go," and he goes and to another "Come," and he comes and to my slave "Do
1:22:19
this." And he does it when Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who
1:22:24
are following him I tell you truthfully I have not found such great faith as
1:22:31
this with anyone in Israel i say to you that many Gentiles
1:22:38
will come from east and west and will sit down to feast at the table and enjoy
1:22:43
God's promises with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven because they accepted me as savior while the
1:22:51
sons and heirs of the kingdom the descendants of Abraham who will not recognize me as Messiah will be thrown
1:22:56
out into the outer darkness in that place which is farthest remove from removed from the kingdom there will be
1:23:02
weeping and sorrow and pain and grinding of teeth and distress and anger then Jesus said to the centurion "Go it will
1:23:09
be done for you as you have believed." And the servant was restored to health at that very
1:23:15
hour there's a lot in this verse there's a lot of revelation in this verse this
1:23:22
is one of my favorite passages
1:23:28
because because it reveals the kind of faith
1:23:33
that God is looking for the kind of faith that is so touching to God the greater kind of faith that God wants us
1:23:39
to have that is rare but God is asking all of us to come up to this level of
1:23:45
faith so Jesus in this moment is really amazed at this gentleman's faith now
1:23:52
he's a centurion soldier he's a gentile he's not a a an Israelite he's a gentile
1:24:01
and he is having greater faith than anyone that Jesus has seen yet including
1:24:08
everyone in Israel all of the people of God
1:24:13
he has greater faith now something that's so powerful
1:24:18
about this scripture is that this man understands the realm of faith the realm
1:24:27
of miracles the the spiritual realm of how Jesus moves and how miracles take
1:24:34
place takes place he gets it he understands it his because of humility
1:24:40
his spiritual eyes opened and he could see and understand he understood
1:24:47
authority you see like with religion when you have old wine you're not humble
1:24:52
and you're stuck in religion like the Pharisees they could not
1:24:58
recognize the spiritual realm that Jesus operated in they couldn't
1:25:04
recognize how miracles were taking place through Jesus they were just rejecting
1:25:10
rejecting rejecting but with this humble heart of the centurion his eyes opened
1:25:15
up and he could understand the spiritual realm he could understand how miracles
1:25:20
took place and this is what he understood he understood that Jesus had
1:25:27
authority over all demonic powers he understood that he understood that it
1:25:34
was the authority that Jesus had simply that made demons to go that made
1:25:41
sicknesses to go that made miracles to happen that was it now the Pharisees and
1:25:48
those in religion whose eyes aren't opened up they don't have this revelation they're so busy thinking that
1:25:54
miracles happen this way through rituals um through like if we fast a certain
1:26:01
amount of time or something then the miracle will take place um a miracle cannot happen on the Sabbath so it has
1:26:07
to be this kind of way like miracles must happen in a box and within rituals
1:26:14
is how they were seeing it they were not seeing that it's not about that it's actually about authority the authority
1:26:21
that Jesus carried so this centurion you know Jesus
1:26:28
he's used to people not having not fully understanding the spiritual realm so he's saying you know I can come to the
1:26:35
your servant in person and be with him in person and pray for him to be healed
1:26:42
these this is this would have been the way that go that Jesus was ministering at that time but this guy had a bigger
1:26:48
faith that he this the centurion knew that it didn't matter if Jesus came in
1:26:55
person or not what mattered was that Jesus had the authority that's all that
1:27:00
mattered and so if Jesus just simply says the word "Be healed your servant
1:27:06
must be healed." The centurion knew that that sickness was forced to leave it had
1:27:12
to go he knew that hallelujah so that's why he said you
1:27:18
don't need to come in person just speak the word and it will be done
1:27:23
hallelujah and that is how that is how the spiritual realm works that is how
1:27:30
miracles take place and so this is how it is today this is what we see in Peter
1:27:36
because we do the same things that Jesus did it's Jesus moving through us but so now it's the same principle so now when
1:27:42
God puts anointing and authority in a servant of God the servant of God can just speak the word and that healing
1:27:49
will take place to the person in the back or to the person in the front or to the person with a one-on-one prayer or
1:27:56
to the person watching online or to the person in the picture that you hold up
1:28:02
or to the person you say "My family members in the hospital." And the word is
1:28:08
declared it doesn't matter if it's a one-on-one prayer or the person is across the world like in Toronto
1:28:15
Canada or in Mexico it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the
1:28:23
miracle will take place either way because it's about the authority in Christ that a servant of God carries
1:28:31
hallelujah hallelujah praise God
1:28:38
so Jesus was so pleased with this faith you can see when you read the scripture
1:28:43
you can see that Jesus's heart was touched he was pleased because with
1:28:48
greater faith God can do more like let's take here for
1:28:55
example people that are sitting here and refuse to believe to have this kind of
1:29:00
greater faith they won't receive miracles if they if they think I can I
1:29:08
must receive a one-on-one prayer then that's the only way the miracle can take
1:29:14
place you know like I I I can't pray for every single person here one-on-one
1:29:21
today but I can declare a word for every single person here today and God can do
1:29:26
miracles in every single person here today and so this pleases God that if you can
1:29:36
all rise up with your faith so that many more miracles can take place so you can all receive miracles that pleases God
1:29:44
because he wants you healed and freed more than you want it he wants the works of the devil destroyed out of your life
1:29:50
more than you want it your miracles are tied to your calling the miracles you
1:29:56
receive lead to you being able to be free to walk in your calling and shining so bright for Jesus the sooner you're
1:30:04
totally freed and healed and walking in abundant life the sooner God can use you
1:30:09
powerfully the sooner many people will be led to Jesus through
1:30:14
you so that's why God wants you to receive miracles deliverance healing
1:30:19
more than you want it so this is so important for us to understand and you know it's not it's not about like God
1:30:26
heal me deliver me we feel like we're the ones like crying out to God for it
1:30:32
like begging him pleading with him to do this for us but it's the opposite he
1:30:37
wants it more than you more than more than you're begging he wants you to receive but he has this principle that
1:30:44
it comes by faith it doesn't come robotically it doesn't come with you manipulating
1:30:50
him like him releasing the miracles how you want to re receive it just by pleading with him no it comes by getting
1:30:57
in line with his principles it comes by walking in your authority by his stripes I'm healed the devil's a liar and a
1:31:04
loser and I am going to be healed i'm going to be delivered i'm actually already healed and I'm going to come to
1:31:09
the church where God's power is watching online if you're far away and I'm going to receive my healing and freedom today
1:31:18
and you position yourself you get in line with God's principles you position yourself and then the anointing hits you god touches you just like he touched the
1:31:25
servant of the centurion soldier but you see how you walking in authority and claiming your healing and freedom and
1:31:31
taking action to position yourself to receive you see how that's opposite from pleading with
1:31:38
God so the first example is faith the
1:31:44
pleading with God is not faith i'm teaching you how to have greater faith
1:31:49
you see so you need to have this faith god
1:31:54
has already done it he wants me to be freed and healed more than I want it he wants me to have abundant life he wants
1:32:00
my business to prosper he wants my finances to prosper more than I want it he wants my ministry to prosper more
1:32:07
than I want it and it's going to happen it's just a matter of timing but I'm
1:32:12
going to do my part so God can bring the increase so God can bless me he blesses
1:32:18
the work of our hands we have to take the action and then he blesses we have to persevere and keep moving forward
1:32:24
keep being obedient and then he blesses that obedience we have to work hard for him but he
1:32:30
blesses the works of our hands and one day all of that work that hard work that
1:32:36
perseverance that obedience day after day it's going to add up to a massive harvest and a suddenly moment that will
1:32:42
shock you won't surprise you because you've had faith that's what kept you
1:32:47
going and persevering but it will shock you it will leave you in awe of God's
1:32:53
faithfulness hallelujah
1:32:59
so look listen to this it says um I tell you truthfully I have not
1:33:05
found such great faith as this with anyone in Israel i say to you that many Gentiles
1:33:10
will come from east and west and will sit down to feast at the table and enjoy God's promises with Abraham Isaac and
1:33:16
Jacob in the kingdom of heaven because they accepted me as savior while the sons and the heirs of the kingdom the descendants of Abraham who will who will
1:33:22
not recognize me as Messiah will be thrown out into outer darkness so this is powerful because he's saying
1:33:30
"Wow I've gone throughout Israel i've been preaching and the people of God the
1:33:36
people that I grew up in the synagogues with the people that are studying the scriptures that are prophesying about
1:33:42
the Messiah who is here Jesus who has come they do not have this faith they
1:33:48
are not believing they are not receiving me but this Gentile is." Amen and so
1:33:54
he's saying here that many people of God will not enter into the kingdom of
1:34:01
heaven but rather Gentiles will because they will have the faith they will have
1:34:07
the humility it's so prophetic this testimony that was shared how she said
1:34:14
it was better that you don't have religion
1:34:19
that's exactly what this scripture is speaking
1:34:25
and we see this we I see this many times i've seen this time and time and time again i've seen this is what I've seen
1:34:31
i've seen people are able to come and receive this anointing step into this revival and flourish and walk in
1:34:38
abundant life and receive so many miracles when they don't have so much religion in them
1:34:45
when they are an open slate religion equals pride
1:34:54
there's no religion without pride there's no Pharisee without pride if you
1:34:59
want to define what religion is today look it's like Pharisees
1:35:05
the Pharisees thought that their way was the only way the right way so anything
1:35:12
that was different was demonic so Jesus comes in a different
1:35:18
way even though there was so many fruits in g in Jesus way more fruits than the
1:35:25
Pharisees but because it was different their pride made them to reject it it is not our way so therefore it's wrong our
1:35:33
way is
1:35:39
perfect so the pride is the biggest stumbling block to faith one of the
1:35:45
biggest stumbling blocks to faith now if you have had so so so actually
1:35:51
what I what I what I was saying is what in my experience over these years of ministering I found that the people who
1:35:58
step into revival and receive the miracles and receive abundant life are one those who haven't been in religion
1:36:04
much they can quickly and easily receive it like a clean slate an open heart or
1:36:11
number two R and Schnell are a great example you both were delivered of so much religion is that
1:36:17
Right they're a great example or people like them who after encount encountering
1:36:25
God's power will humble themselves you see when you're not in
1:36:31
religion you don't have as much humbling to do we all have to humble ourselves amen
1:36:36
but if you've been in religion there's a greater amount of humbling that you have
1:36:41
to do so if you've been in religion I'm not
1:36:47
saying like oh too bad for you it's going to be really hard to enter in the kingdom of heaven but I will say if you
1:36:54
keep your pride it will be very hard impossible you have to see
1:37:02
rightly what you have in you you have to see rightly what you have in you you
1:37:07
have to see rightly the true religion and pride and ego that you have in you you have to see that
1:37:15
rightly and you have to see I have a lot of work to do in humbling myself this is my greatest weakness this
1:37:23
is my greatest stumbling block so I must make the greatest intention
1:37:28
here to please God you must have faith so for me to be able to have faith and please God humbling myself has to be the
1:37:35
number one thing I'm doing for me to be able to have faith for me to be able to please God
1:37:41
amen the Bible says "Humble yourself." So that's something that you have to do ask
1:37:48
God to help you ask God to open up your spiritual eyes ask God to to do a work
1:37:54
in your heart but you have to then take the action to humble yourself you have to
1:38:01
take the action of renewing your mind with the new wine
1:38:08
you have to take the action of coming with an open heart you have to take the action of rejecting all pride all voices
1:38:14
of pride all voices of skepticism and and declaring "I'm going to receive the word of God through my
1:38:20
leader through the servant of God today i'm going to receive it with an open heart i'm going to receive it like a
1:38:25
child i'm going to come to church and be a true disciple i'm going to write down the notes and I'm going to take them as
1:38:31
the word of God rather than question them rather than uh uh uh try to compare them with my knowledge
1:38:41
this is I'm I'm teaching you how to humble yourself how to take the action to humble yourself amen
1:38:50
so this is powerful this this this scripture is so powerful when you see
1:38:56
today the people that oppose the work of God the revival the most it is the Pharisees it is the religious people it
1:39:02
is the so-called godly people many times unfortunately it is the ministers the
1:39:08
Christian leaders who oppose the work of God the most that's what I've seen in my own
1:39:13
personal life the very biggest opposition the very biggest attacks the very biggest demonic evil attacks and
1:39:20
hatred that has come towards me has come through Christian leaders not all but
1:39:25
the but it has been Christian leaders the biggest ones and I mean the biggest
1:39:31
kinds of attacks that I've faced but that's the same as it was in the times of
1:39:38
Jesus it wasn't just the people attending the synagogue it was the leaders the
1:39:45
Pharisees it was the people in leadership in the synagogues that that
1:39:50
that made their this campaign to try to get him crucified and were the ones responsible
1:39:57
for it right and so here we have this centurion
1:40:03
soldier this person who didn't even grow up in the synagogues who has the greatest faith
1:40:09
greater faith than Jesus has ever
1:40:18
seen this is this is like what God has been speaking how we must become like a child the centurion soldier was not a
1:40:25
child but he was childlike
1:40:31
this is how we must be to please God this is how we must be to have a great faith to be like the centurion
1:40:38
soldier and humble ourselves you see I think it's it's so powerful that the centurion soldier really understood the
1:40:45
authority it's the one time we see in scripture where it is explained like it
1:40:50
is explained how the miracles take place by the authority of Christ a servant of
1:40:56
God executing their authority of Christ that's how the miracles take place i love the scripture so much but how that
1:41:04
took place was that was because he humbled himself he humbled himself and that's how his spiritual eyes could open
1:41:10
up and perceive the mysteries of the spiritual realm which then leads to a greater
1:41:16
faith because we start out with a faith that God simply exists we start out with
1:41:22
a faith that God loves us then we have a faith that God has good plans for us but
1:41:27
then as we continue to humble ourselves God opens up our spiritual eyes and our faith expands our understanding of the
1:41:34
spiritual realm expands the Bible says "My people perish because of lack of knowledge but you shall know the truth
1:41:41
and the truth shall set you free." So the more truth that we perceive the more
1:41:47
that we can see and understand how the spiritual realm operates the stronger
1:41:53
our faith becomes amen it's like when you understand God's
1:42:00
principles you understand what it means when he says he's not it's not a man that he should he's not a man that he would
1:42:06
lie every word that God speaks does not return void it will accomplish what it was sent forth to do you understand that
1:42:13
before those are just nice words to say but then when you understand the principles of God that God stays true to
1:42:20
his principles like like his principles of using anointed vessels of God putting
1:42:26
anointing and authority in them and so then you just simply come to the church where God's power is and it's very
1:42:32
simple the miracles have to take place the demons have to go sicknesses have to
1:42:37
go it's so simple so you understand that principle and then that gives you so much faith
1:42:44
i'm going to the house of God where God's power is tuning in online and God's going to heal me and
1:42:51
deliver me rather than
1:42:57
some lofty belief yes God heals and delivers some people but not others he
1:43:04
doesn't and I don't know i've been praying for a while and I haven't seen healing so I don't know but I'll keep on praying you see how that faith is so
1:43:11
much smaller but when you understand the spiritual realm more by humbling yourself you learn the principles and so
1:43:19
now you're understanding the principles you understand this is how to receive from God this will happen if we just
1:43:24
follow his principles great faith
1:43:30
hallelujah great understanding leads to great faith and great understanding
1:43:36
comes as you humble yourself so God can open your spiritual eyes
1:43:51
hallelujah first Kings 13 uh sorry First Kings 18:41 now Elijah said to Ahab "Go up eat
1:43:59
and drink for there is the sound of the roar of an abundance of rain." So Ahab went up to eat and drink
1:44:06
and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and he crouched down to the earth and put his face between his knees and he
1:44:12
said to his servant "Go up look toward the sea." So he went up and looked and said "There is nothing." Elijah said "Go
1:44:19
back seven times." And at the seventh time the servant said "A cloud as small
1:44:24
as a man's hand is coming up from the sea." And Elijah said "Go up say to Ahab
1:44:30
prepare your chariot and go down so that the rain shower does not stop you." And a little while the sky grew dark with
1:44:36
clouds and wind and there were heavy showers and Ahab mounted and rode his chariot and went inland to to
1:44:43
Jezrael so Elijah the prophet heard from God that a great rain was coming in a
1:44:50
time where there was a drought and he says there was a sound of the roar of an
1:44:55
abundance of rain so um so so he says "Go up and look for those clouds the
1:45:02
rain clouds." And the servant says there is nothing so Elijah says go back seven
1:45:09
times so seven time so so so the servant is going and looking for the raincloud like the like God had spoken through the
1:45:15
prophet and seeing nothing so he comes back and reports there's nothing still go back again so he goes back there's
1:45:22
nothing seven times this happens and it wasn't until the seventh time that the
1:45:28
cloud appeared so um this this kind of thing is going to
1:45:35
happen in life many times where God will speak something it can be a prophecy it
1:45:40
can be through a servant of God a prophetic word it can be just a promise that God has made you maybe it's just
1:45:46
simply a promise of healing that we all have by his stripes we are healed or
1:45:51
maybe it's a promise you know that God wants your business to prosper and grow or your ministry to grow um you have
1:46:00
this promise and you feel in your heart like it should be growing by now the
1:46:05
miracle should be happening by now but a day has gone two days have gone three days have gone four days or maybe it's
1:46:12
one month has gone by two months have gone by three or maybe it's one year has gone by two years have gone three years
1:46:17
have gone by and there's nothing you're looking at the sky and you see nothing
1:46:25
there's a reason why God brings delay like this and this is to test your faith
1:46:32
because God wants your faith to grow he wants you to have such big faith in him
1:46:37
but the only way your faith can can grow is if your faith is tested how is your faith tested by a prolonged amount of
1:46:45
time where you're believing in God believing in God to do something but you're not seeing it happen
1:46:51
yet anybody want faith to grow your faith to grow well then you got to be okay with
1:46:57
the testing you got to be okay with the stretching and this is what it looks
1:47:03
like a prolonged amount of time where you're not seeing the miracle the increase the blessing take place
1:47:15
yet so so often we are we are wondering God why isn't this happening yet god is
1:47:20
saying "You prayed that you would have a bigger faith in me you want to please me
1:47:26
more." Well to please me more you need to have a bigger faith because you can't please me without faith and if you want
1:47:31
to please me the most you need to have a great faith so you say "Lord Lord I want to
1:47:37
please you." That's my desire the desire of my heart every day Lord is to please you the Bible says you can't please God
1:47:43
without faith so now days have passed weeks have passed years have passed and you're not
1:47:48
seeing the promise come to pass yet it's it's the answer of God's prayer that you
1:47:54
would please him so that your faith would grow hallelujah
1:48:01
i've seen this happen so often in my life so often in my life why isn't this happening yet i look back and I know
1:48:09
it's because God wanted my faith to be stretched and I and and and I and I'll
1:48:14
never forget the moment when I saw a promise come to pass after waiting for four and a half years when revival broke
1:48:22
out actually four years ago to this week May
1:48:28
30th 2021 that is a day where the promise
1:48:34
came to pass of revival breaking out and reaching the whole world
1:48:44
for four years up to that point I was ministering in the church
1:48:49
five of Church was very small 20 people 15 people in the next year 10 people the next year five people the next year it
1:48:55
decreased every year down to two people the year that COVID happened and then we went outside one time I'm preaching in
1:49:01
the park September of 2020 and one person is there and they leave in the middle of the message and waiting was really not easy
1:49:09
waiting was really not fun and I would I would wonder so often why isn't it
1:49:15
happening yet why isn't there at least some sort of increase why i really feel
1:49:22
like it should happen by now why isn't it happening but all that time God was
1:49:29
stretching my faith every single day my faith was getting bigger it didn't feel like it but I would feel it the moment
1:49:36
the promise came to pass when that promise came to pass and 300 people
1:49:42
filled the amphitheater to where it was overflowing May 30th
1:49:49
2021 and every week after that people traveled on an airplane to come and
1:49:54
receive people tuned in from online from all over the world every single week since then that month the months
1:50:02
following I've never felt such a strong faith in God in my life i just I didn't
1:50:08
know how to verbalize it i just would say to people I remember going on live so often i remember saying I just want
1:50:14
to go on the rooftops and scream God is [Music]
1:50:21
faithful that that's the only way I could verbalize that i wanted to just like shake every person and say God is
1:50:31
faithful like you have to trust God he is faithful
1:50:37
he will do what he said he would do his promises are yes and amen he does not
1:50:43
lie the promises will come to pass he's
1:50:52
faithful i've never felt that kind of faith that kind of faith that kind of
1:50:58
faith of God is faithful i've never felt that the way I felt it after waiting for
1:51:06
4 and 1/2 years after that prolonged time of looking up at the sky for the
1:51:12
raincloud and finally the rain the revival rain
1:51:23
falling and now I could from that moment I could be used so much more powerfully
1:51:28
than if I didn't go through that I can be used by God so much powerfully to
1:51:33
ignite faith in others that God's faithful if he did it for me he can do
1:51:39
it for you
1:51:44
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God
1:51:53
so one of the one of the biggest um one of the biggest enemies of faith
1:52:01
is
1:52:06
impatience and when you don't see something happening for so
1:52:12
long it can be tempting to have impatience like I'm tired of waiting
1:52:20
i want it to come now why isn't it coming now and then you can start focusing on
1:52:29
that you can start meditating on this impatience and that then brings
1:52:39
doubt if you keep meditating on impatient impatience it leads to doubt
1:52:44
that's why I say impatience is the biggest enemy one of the biggest enemies to faith
1:52:52
so what's so important to to to to renew your mind with is the stories like the story of Elisha's servant my story in my
1:53:00
own life that the delay is for your good it is not mean it is not evidence that
1:53:06
the miracle is not going to take place no no no no no no no no no never think that never think
1:53:12
that you need to see constant progress i s for me it looked like I was going backwards and for Elisha's servant he
1:53:19
wasn't even seeing a tiny cloud he was seeing nothing for the six times he went so he wasn't even see so when you
1:53:27
keep on seeing nothing nothing nothing nothing there's that temptation to to for doubt to come in and say "Well I
1:53:34
don't know it's been so long and I'm not even seeing anything close to it so maybe it's not going to happen." Don't fall for that lie of the
1:53:41
devil most promises all promises we have to
1:53:48
wait for actually because that's how God produces
1:53:53
faith in us the waiting before the promise hallelujah
1:54:05
um in these moments of impatience renew your mind that there is a reason why it hasn't happened yet
1:54:12
there's a reason why the promise hasn't come to pass yet you can know for sure one of the reasons is because God is
1:54:18
using this to build your faith god God is using this to to to produce more of
1:54:23
the fruits of his spirit because that's what happens every time you obey God obey God and choosing to be patient
1:54:29
obeying God and choosing to trust him and not doubt obeying God and just showing up and serving him even though
1:54:35
you're not receiving anything from it keeping on obeying him and serving him even though you're not seeing the fruit
1:54:42
from the seeds you're sewing yet every time you obey God in these
1:54:48
actions God molds your heart to be more like him it's an automatic thing that takes place it's beautiful it's not that
1:54:57
complicated to be transformed into the image of God it just takes obedience and God does the
1:55:02
rest hallelujah is it it's produced in you supernaturally as you keep choosing
1:55:07
to obey God as you keep resisting the devil's lies and his
1:55:13
temptations so you can know for sure that that is why it hasn't happened yet
1:55:18
that's reason number one but there could be other reasons god's timing is perfect god's ways are not our ways they are
1:55:24
higher the Bible says his thoughts and his ways are not our ways they are actually higher and so I even think
1:55:32
about this for me you know I've received so many prophecies of this revival how it will expand so massively all over the
1:55:39
world that we haven't seen anything yet glory to God and oh my heart my heart wants
1:55:46
everything now my heart I'm I'm with you i understand you my I get you like we
1:55:52
none of us like to wait none of us like to wait because when it's talking about
1:55:58
waiting for God's promises that's never going to be exactly fun because God's promises are
1:56:04
so beautiful and amazing and God's promises are leading to a greater glory and a greater abundant life and a
1:56:10
greater fulfillance of walking in your calling so there's they are so beautiful that how can we not want them right now
1:56:18
of course I'm with you i get you i've been there i'm still
1:56:24
there i understand you know I
1:56:30
understand but God has spoken really this to me even about his plans and
1:56:35
expanding this revival it's complex man that's not up to me that's up to God like no I mean
1:56:42
like the devil's schemes that's complex i don't got to
1:56:47
worry about that that's up to God but what I mean is like God knows the
1:56:53
perfect timing to make his moves he knows the perfect timing to open up
1:56:59
doors he's behind the scenes preparing hearts to receive him
1:57:08
just like in this year of acceptance we're seeing so many people receive Jesus like we've never seen before there was a preparation that led to that
1:57:15
amen so God's not going to force his revival upon people when they're not ready you know the expansion of
1:57:23
it these are complex things that we don't have to understand or figure out we just need to know God's timing is
1:57:29
best and I and I don't want to go before his timing or that's going to bring trouble
1:57:38
amen so you have to have the understanding that things may not be happening yet
1:57:44
because God sees the bigger picture that you don't understand and bad things would happen if the
1:57:52
promise came to pass earlier maybe you couldn't handle it personally maybe there's a refining that needs to happen
1:57:58
in you first or maybe it's outside factors other
1:58:03
factors god knows best he knows what he's doing so we simply trust him
1:58:11
hallelujah hallelujah um another way to renew your
1:58:19
mind to not be impatient is to remember how blessed your life is
1:58:30
the moment you've stepped into life with Jesus especially with the fullness of Jesus in
1:58:37
his anointing your life has become beautiful and blessed day one amen
1:58:44
your life is not what it used to be you have so many blessings right now
1:58:49
you used to not have you used to be oppressed you used to be in sickness you used to not have any friends now you
1:58:54
have precious family in Christ now you are healed now you are freed you used to
1:59:00
be bound by religion and and be beaten down by the devil with
1:59:05
condemnation not having intimacy with God but now you have a real relationship with Jesus now you're walking in his
1:59:12
love and his peace and his joy that's a beautiful life that's a
1:59:18
beautiful life and sometimes it's really easy to forget that but if you could step back to where
1:59:25
your life was and live it for one day and
1:59:31
com amen and compare it to what you're living now you would see your life so
1:59:38
differently you wouldn't want for anything you would be thanking God with all your heart not taking any blessing
1:59:46
for granted and so if you're ever feeling impatient you need to renew your mind and practice gratitude you need to
1:59:53
look around at all the blessings in your life and compare it to what life used to be like and remember how blessed you are
1:59:59
right now don't wish away this precious beautiful season you are in with God
2:00:04
right now it is beautiful and it is blessed stop idolizing the
2:00:12
promise be grateful for what God has given you your life with him now and
2:00:18
this season you are in with him now amen hallelujah
2:00:30
and the other enemy to faith is pride as I mentioned earlier
2:00:36
pride so what can cause people in the waiting when they're not seeing the
2:00:42
promises to come to pass yet um what can what can happen the enemy can come with
2:00:47
these thoughts of entitlement and it can be these thoughts of like I
2:00:52
should have these blessings by now i should have these promises by now why aren't they here yet i've done all of
2:00:58
this for God i deserve this you start thinking like that and
2:01:03
then entitlement will creep in and that's
2:01:09
pride and that and it can lead to bitterness towards God which leads to doubt
2:01:17
so that's why I say pride is the enemy to faith so if you start to feel feelings
2:01:23
of entitlement how come I don't have this yet reject those thoughts renew your
2:01:31
mind renew your mind that you don't deserve any of these things we don't even deserve to have breath in our lungs
2:01:38
we don't deserve any not even one of the blessings that we have it is all by
2:01:43
God's grace and we ha we have like we I don't know
2:01:51
the number but we each have at least probably hundreds maybe a thousand I
2:01:56
don't know the number but so many blessings that we don't deserve we don't deserve
2:02:02
even one of them and we don't just have one blessing that we don't deserve two three four we have hundreds thousands i
2:02:09
don't even know the number we can't count them all all the blessings and miracles but think about
2:02:16
that you don't deserve even one of them so it's actually silly crazy to
2:02:22
think that you have hundreds thousands of blessings and you're you you're
2:02:27
entitled to them all and you're entitled to other blessings you don't have yet that's silly we need to renew our mind
2:02:34
and humble oursel amen that yes God want that yes
2:02:40
God wants to give us these blessings in the future yes God wants to give these promises to us but not because we
2:02:45
deserve it because he loves us and wants to bless us and it's for his glory and
2:02:51
because he is going to reward those who who seek after him but that's not because we deserve it it be it's because
2:02:57
he loves us so much that he wants to reward us amen hallelujah
2:03:11
the centurion's words his words that he spoke jesus you
2:03:18
do not need to come to my house or just speak the word because I understand how it works
2:03:24
i'm a man of authority myself i understand the authority of Christ you have that the miracle will take place
2:03:29
just when you speak with authority it was those words that pleased
2:03:38
God it was those words that equaled
2:03:44
faith it was his words so I want to teach you right now how to have faith
2:03:50
the first part is to not do what I just taught i mean is to reject impatience and
2:03:55
entitlement but the second part is to understand what God counts as faith
2:04:02
your words the centurion did not have
2:04:07
to say "I feel so much faith in my
2:04:13
heart for God to be pleased." He just had to speak you don't
2:04:20
need to come to my house just speak the word that's what amazed Jesus was the
2:04:26
words that he spoke hey there could have been the devil attacking the centurion
2:04:32
in his mind at this point speaking words of doubt and he rejected him he rejected
2:04:39
those words and he spoke the truth instead and the words are what were counted as
2:04:44
faith not everything that was going on in his mind and his heart it was just the
2:04:51
words hallelujah hallelujah so um many people they think
2:04:58
that it's all about feelings but feelings many times come from lies of the devil they're influenced by the
2:05:04
devil your feelings not all the time but sometimes anytime your feelings aren't aligning with the truth of God of God's
2:05:11
words your feelings are being influenced by the devil and you do not have to live by your feelings you do not have to
2:05:17
speak what your feelings are saying you do not need to be guided by them you can reject your feelings your thoughts and
2:05:25
actually that's what the Bible tells us to do it takes it says "Take every thought obedient take it captive make it
2:05:32
obedient to Christ take every thought captive and make it obedient to to Christ." So it's
2:05:38
actually saying "Take an action these thoughts you have in your mind that aren't obedient to Christ t make them
2:05:44
captive and change them to be obedient." Hallelujah
2:05:53
the Bible says "Resist the devil and he must flee." The main way you're going to be resist resisting him is how the
2:05:59
devil's coming in your thoughts and your feelings resist him reject those
2:06:05
thoughts get it out of your mind reject with your mouth and focus on the word of
2:06:10
God and the truth and confess the word of God the truth and that's how you overcome that's how you get the lies out
2:06:19
and that's how you choose to have faith and that's what God counts as
2:06:26
faith amen luke 6:45 "A good man brings good things
2:06:32
out of the good stored up in his heart and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for
2:06:39
the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."
2:06:45
So if you are meditating if you're thinking a lot of doubt pride
2:06:53
entitlement things that oppose faith you need to sound the
2:06:59
alarm i mean you need to see this as an emergency uh-uh i need to take action in the
2:07:06
spirit right now the devil's trying to take over i will not let him the devil
2:07:11
knows this this scripture he knows the truth of the scripture that's why he sends thoughts that's why he sends
2:07:17
feelings he wants you to meditate to choose to to meditate is a choice is
2:07:22
when you continually think on something so the enemy will send
2:07:28
thoughts and feelings it's up to you whether you will meditate on those thoughts those feelings or you will
2:07:33
reject them so when you start to have these feelings
2:07:39
bombard you these thoughts bombard you from the enemy you need to take action you need to take it as very seriously
2:07:45
because of this scripture because the words are what God counts as truth the words is what is counted as truth in the
2:07:50
spiritual realm your words is what is counted as giving authority to the devil or giving authority to
2:07:57
God so how do you have control over your words you need to have control over what
2:08:03
you meditate on you need to take action on what you're meditating on so reject the lies don't keep thinking on the lies
2:08:11
of the devil the feelings of the devil the devil's giving and make the renew
2:08:16
that's why this says be transformed by the renewing of your mind go to the word of God that's
2:08:21
speaking opposite of these lies and renew your mind read the word speak it
2:08:27
aloud think on it think on it think on it meditate on it meditate on it
2:08:33
and that becomes what you meditate on becomes what's in your heart out of the abundance of your heart
2:08:40
is what the mouth speaks so what is stored up what is the what what is filled in in the heart is what comes out
2:08:48
of the mouth it's a principle hallelujah so to have greater
2:08:54
faith you need to watch what you're meditating on you have control of what
2:09:00
you meditate on you do you have the choice you have the power holy Spirit gives you the power it gives you the
2:09:06
strength to reject the devil and to choose to think on what is right the word of God the truth of
2:09:12
God and it's so it's very simple it's very simple to have great faith meditate
2:09:18
on the truth resist the devil and speak the truth speak what's in your heart
2:09:23
what you stored up in your heart the truth god's word and that's what and then you become like
2:09:28
the centurion soldier and God counts that as faith so no matter what you're feeling
2:09:34
you say to God "Lord I believe you're going to touch me today i believe just the word coming from your servant will touch me you will move in your power
2:09:41
through this through your servant today and it will come upon my life." And God sees you like he sees a
2:09:49
centurion soldier he sees you wow that's great faith even if you were battling
2:09:55
with lies of the devil he sees what you spoke and he sees it as great faith and
2:10:00
you have just pleased God and now you will receive great miracles
2:10:05
it's simple to have great faith hallelujah thank you Jesus
2:10:17
you have to be careful what you confess because when you confess negatively it be I it's like you're speaking on the
2:10:24
frequency of the devil and the devil cannot hear what
2:10:31
everybody says but if you start to speak negatively it's like you've tuned yourself into the you've contributed to
2:10:37
the negative frequency in the spiritual realm the devil's frequency and so now it's like the devil's kingdom
2:10:45
is aware that you're given authority to the devil that you're choosing to speak
2:10:50
on this negative frequency so that then that's the action of opening the door to the devil so
2:10:56
that's the action of the devil being able to bombard you with more negative
2:11:01
thoughts and feelings thoughts of doubt thoughts of entitlement thoughts
2:11:08
of pride any kind of negative thought that condemning any voice from the devil lie
2:11:14
from the devil so so so that's why I say this is
2:11:19
so important what you're speaking i'm very careful about what I speak to make to protect my
2:11:25
faith sometimes the waiting is not fun sometimes the waiting is not easy but
2:11:31
I'm careful how I speak i can speak things like "I thought it would happen by now." But I know God has
2:11:38
something up his sleeve i know God has has a great plan that I don't know about
2:11:44
i know the promise will come to pass i know it's on its way i know God's
2:11:50
going to amaze me god's going to shock me god's going to surprise me i thought it was going to happen this way it didn't happen this way that means God's going to surprise me thank you Jesus
2:11:57
thank you Lord help me Lord give me more patience give me more strength i believe you Lord
2:12:04
i believe in your promises i may not feel that way inside but this is what I choose to speak
2:12:11
because I want to protect my faith and help my faith to grow
2:12:17
more give God permission for him to build a greater faith in me amen
2:12:25
so don't speak words of doubt it's it's it's giving a door to the
2:12:31
enemy opening the door to the enemy don't speak words of doubt don't speak words of entitlement don't speak words
2:12:38
of pride be careful what you speak amen
2:12:44
hallelujah so this is a prophetic word of God for you today that he has for
2:12:50
