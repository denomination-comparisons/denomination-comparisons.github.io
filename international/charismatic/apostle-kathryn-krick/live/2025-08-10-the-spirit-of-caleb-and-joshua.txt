[Applause]

45:49
Welcome home. Welcome back home, Laura. Laura has been planted at 5F Church for
45:57
for two years. Yes. From Germany. And and now you are leading a small group in Germany.
46:03
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can you share briefly your testimony and
46:10
also what God has been doing in the small group? Um so it's been two years ago that I
46:17
found a ministry. um in 2023 and um I've been a believer my whole life but I
46:23
lived lukewarm because I didn't know the power of God and becoming part of this
46:28
ministry has changed my life forever like I encountered the power of God and
46:35
my first event in person was revivalist now in the Netherlands in May in 2023 and there I received freedom from fear
46:42
of man from um the spirit of religion from rejection and I felt this hint hindrance that I had inside of me, this
46:49
blockage fall off of me. There was like a blockage inside of me to um like be able to shine my light the way I was
46:56
supposed to and the way like Jesus wants us to, right? I was just so afraid of
47:01
what people would would think of me. And um I really felt this blockage fall off of me and I received fire, so much fire
47:10
for Jesus. And this fire kept growing in me. So I
47:16
was like I need to experience more of it. Like we need the power of God in
47:21
Germany. Like first of all I was like I need to experience more of it. And um so
47:27
I came exactly two years ago actually was the first time when I came to LA for
47:32
the first time. And I was just so hungry for the power of God. And then you spoke
47:38
over me that God would use me in Germany. And at that time I didn't have quite a heart for my own country yet. I
47:45
was just like, I need to experience the power of God wherever it is. But then God started to build this heart in me
47:50
for revival in Germany to just spread there and break out more and like for
47:57
churches and for people in Germany to experience the power of God. So I had this fire and I was like, well, if like
48:04
God wants to use me in any way, I need to be equipped more. So I was like,
48:09
okay, I need to come back. And that's why I came for three months. That was in 2024 because I felt like I need this
48:15
equipping like I need to come and be equipped and that was exactly what that time was about for me to just like
48:22
surrender more like be equipped more and say yes to Jesus even more and um so I
48:31
went back to Germany and that's actually funny how God moves because I thought I needed this plan right like I quit my
48:38
job to come here and I was like I'm going to have a plan when I come back like what to do next kind of thing. But
48:44
I went back to Germany and I didn't have any plan. Um I was like what am I going to do now? Like I want to serve God but
48:50
I don't know how. Like okay God like I need like some kind of plan but it was
48:56
so beautiful how God was just like leading me step by step. That's like through your teachings and through the
49:03
anointed word and through the wisdom I keep receiving. God was just leading my every step. I see that now. I was just
49:09
like okay I need to find a job now. And like and then I started serving and I was so blessed and like step by step God
49:16
was leading the way and I really I'm my life is so blessed and I really want to
49:22
honor you apostle for laying down your life um to like you are such a powerful
49:28
example and God knew I needed this example and all of us do and I really
49:34
want to honor you for that because like I know I can imitate you as you imitate Christ and this has changed my life
49:41
forever to know like to have this example and to know I can be so safe in
49:47
the will of God. Um, and like just knowing he will speak to me when he
49:53
needs me to hear something and I'm going to hear the wisdom and everything I need. So, I'm so blessed. This has been
50:00
so powerful to be part of this ministry and to keep growing in this um in this anointing. Praise God.
50:09
Amen. Yes. And the small groups um have started in Germany. It's been such a
50:17
blessing to meet with people from Germany every week. And there's been so
50:22
many people signing up actually. So we really saw a hunger in Germany. And it was so beautiful to just see hungry
50:30
hearts come together, like pure hearts, like just wanting to learn more about
50:35
the new wine and about the anointing and like wanting to be equipped more. There's been testimonies shared too of
50:43
um people receiving freedom in so many areas especially um through coming to the events in London and Stockholm and
50:50
like there's been so many testimonies and just I feel like the biggest thing that God is doing is the unity that he's
50:57
building through this because I feel like when when you're watching online you can sometimes feel so alone because
51:03
you don't see like people around you being part of the revival. Um, so I feel like many people from Germany have felt
51:09
this way, but now the small group is there and like now we can see how many people are actually part of it already
51:16
and that we're not alone because we're all in this together and this army is growing more and more. So this has been
51:22
so powerful to see the hunger of the people in the pure hearts in the small group.
51:28
Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
51:34
Hallelujah. Ah, I'm proud of you, Laura. I'm proud of you for leading the small
51:39
group and carrying this fire to your nation and having this heart for your people in Germany. Let this revival
51:46
spread in Germany from now in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
51:55
Praise God. Praise God. Nikki,
52:00
yeah, come to the stage. [Applause]
52:11
Nikki is also a small group leader, 5F church small group leader in North Carolina.
52:17
Hallelujah. Can you share your testimony and what
52:22
God has been doing in the North Carolina small group? Yes. So, God has been so good. Um, I
52:29
encountered the power of God um through Apostle Katherine for the first time in December of 2022. I attended um a
52:35
Revival Now event in Rockport, Texas. And I came just hungry and expectant with my children's pictures because um
52:42
my one son um Chuma had a autism and the other son had developmental delays. And
52:48
you know there was no solution to a lot of complaints from the teacher and I was just frustrated. And one day you know I
52:56
just searched online um does God heal autism and Apostle Katherine popped up
53:01
on the screen. Yeah. Praise God.
53:11
And so I came with their pictures expecting and of course you know the enemy tried to oppose like stop me from coming in different ways but I was able
53:17
to come and Apostle Katherine looked saw their pictures and declared over them and send the anointing to them. So my
53:23
children were in Charlotte, North Carolina. I was in Texas and she declared um and that God's power would
53:30
God's kingdom will come in their life and you know just p prophetic declarations. And when I got home, my
53:36
son that used to scream a lot was no longer screaming. God is so good.
53:43
And there were just so many positive reports after that. Um he started getting awards. My other son that had
53:49
developmental delays, um his reading was below grade level reading. And before
53:54
you know it, like in a few weeks, it was now above grade level reading.
53:59
Um my daughter was touched by the power of God watching online and really one day
54:05
just started renouncing and even speaking in tongues one day. So it was just so powerful
54:10
and you know I was changed forever too. I mean you know I used to like you know drink and just have all of these
54:16
thoughts that don't glorify God. And you know in fact the last time I ever drank alcohol was the day of that re revival
54:22
event in December 2022. Yeah. God has been so good. So I to God
54:29
be all the glory. Um you know so with the small groups you know I've been blessed with the opportunity to be a
54:34
small group leader and the first small group meeting for the five f North Carolina small group was um May 4th of
54:41
this year and we've had about 60 um signups people interested in North Carolina and surrounding states. So
54:48
Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. And we've been meeting online weekly via Zoom. And you know I really was looking
54:54
forward to every you know having an in-person meeting and it's like every time I you know I tried to gauge the you
55:00
know the members and see who was available was maybe one or two. So we've never had an in-person meeting in North
55:07
Carolina. And then one day after the Minneapolis event I just had this hunger to come to 5F church on a Sunday and
55:14
because my heart's desire is to be here every Sunday. Yeah. And for me, watching it online, I
55:20
mean, it's great, but I really want to be here here every Sunday. So, I just thought about it. I was like, you know, I looked at my calendar. I said, August
55:26
10th will be great. It works well with my schedule, the kids schedule. I went about doing whatever I had to do. And
55:32
then an hour later, I get an email from Jane, who's in the small group, like, you know, Nikki, just so you know, um, I
55:39
just booked, I think she said she booked her flight to come to 5F Church on August 10th. And and I'm thinking like
55:45
of all Sundays and you know I mean we still have the rest of the year is the exact same Sunday. So that was confirmation. So I decided to offer it
55:52
to the group and about six of the members and their families are here. So we have 10
56:01
yeah.
56:08
Can you all stand up? Those of you in the small group. Hallelujah.
56:15
This is our family in North Carolina and the surrounding states. Hallelujah. Welcome home.
56:26
So God is so good because you know we couldn't meet in person in North Carolina, but here we are across the country in person and we're here at the
56:33
well. So I'm so expectant and I honor you, mama. I thank you so much for all you've done. Thank you for the
56:39
opportunity to serve you and for trusting me with leading the small groups and um we're here and expecting to receive all that God has for us
56:46
today. So, glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
56:51
Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Wow. This
56:58
is amazing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
57:04
uh Mary from Las Vegas
57:12
and Pastor Roger and Civil, you can come next.
57:20
Hi. Hallelujah. I hear you have a testimony of impartation. Is that right?
57:26
Yes. you have graciously laid a hand on me in um November and because I told you
57:34
that I pray for people in the healing room in Las Vegas and uh you said may
57:40
this power of God come upon you may God come in power let people be healed let
57:46
people be delivered in Jesus' name and things changed and now I see results
57:53
people come back and tell me things I have been prior to that um serving in the healing room for about five years
58:00
but I really didn't see a you know results but uh but then this happened
58:07
and I saw miracles and I saw people delivered and and
58:13
yes so uh also I took the class walking in miracles and I learned a lot of very
58:19
important principles because you can't walk in miracles without knowing what to you you know expect and So, um, so I I I
58:28
took the class and, uh, uh, you know, one of the things that happened like people that serve, like in the green
58:34
room while we get ready to go and pray for people, uh, one that serves with me, I was telling her about you because I
58:41
tell everybody, anything that has ears, I'm telling about you. So, uh, I told her and she said, "Oh,
58:48
where is she? Uh, is that the one on her phone?" And then your voice came out like she clicked on something and then
58:53
as soon as she heard your voice, she started manifesting and then she turned
58:58
it off right away and she she does serve there and she prays for people. But but
59:04
I and then I was surprised. I told her, "Did you feel that?" She said, "Yes." I I said, "Do you want to get rid of it?"
59:10
She said, "Yes." So, right there in the green room, she I she stood in the middle and um I I did I followed exactly
59:17
what you do, of course, what what you taught us and um she started jumping up
59:22
and down, turning around, going crazy. And then finally, she calmed down and uh yeah, and she started crying and then
59:29
she came back a few days later when I saw her. She was so singing, happy,
59:34
praising God for being free. Praise God.
59:40
And yeah, a couple more, two, three more people deliverance. This lady, she
59:46
started screaming. I I I started declaring and casting out demons. And she and then I and then she started
59:52
crying after. I said, "How do you feel?" She said, "Oh, uh, when as soon as you said total freedom, things shifted." And
1:00:00
um, and she said, "Your ears were piercing." I said, "Okay." You know, that's the power of God. Because so um,
1:00:07
also people have been healed. Um yeah, this lady, she needed this her foot was
1:00:13
totally um twisted and she said, "I've been wanting to have a surgery for a long time, but the doctors want have me
1:00:20
go have a surgery because my blood numbers were not uh they were not what they want them to be for the surgery."
1:00:26
So, she said, "I'm at six. They need me to be 10 or 11." I prayed for her. Two weeks later, she just came back. She
1:00:32
said, "Thank you. I scheduled my surgery. Now it's 10." Yes. A and another person also I prayed
1:00:40
for his foot and he said, "Oh, now it's straight and I'm I'm skipping even. I'm not taking medication." So, but the one
1:00:48
that's really precious and close to my heart is one of my students because I teach in high school and I have a Bible club and I want revival to reach my
1:00:56
students. That's important, you know. Yeah. Every school should have a Bible club. By law, it is allowed. And so, uh,
1:01:04
I teach them everything that you teach. and the healing, deliverance, the Holy Spirit presence, everything. So when
1:01:12
when he he came one time with all this red, you know, and they don't know what's going on and it's been there and
1:01:18
I prayed for him and then two days later he walks in my room and it's all gone. And then he thinks nothing of it. He
1:01:24
thinks that's normal. Yeah, that's what he expected because that's what he's been taught. Like he was very grateful.
1:01:30
But like, you know, so yeah, my students know that we have a prayer table during lunch. It's allowed. And we have a sign
1:01:38
that says free prayer. And we sit at a table. The students pray for other
1:01:43
students. I'm surprised how many come for prayer. And it's just awesome and
1:01:49
amazing. And you know, um, also I just been listening to how many countries are
1:01:56
joining. I'm I'm Egyptian and I'm American as well and I speak fluent
1:02:01
Arabic. And I'm thinking, where where would you guys where would you have me God serve in this, you know, uh in the
1:02:08
Middle East, you know, coming in and and I had a prophecy two years ago that says God is aligning you with your tribe and
1:02:15
I never Okay, but I'm waiting for I I went to Egypt last year, last summer. That was not it. So, I'm just thinking,
1:02:22
oh, okay. What does God have for me? And I'm willing to serve because I've learned from you to surrender
1:02:29
everything. How to surrender all. I've learned in the walking in miracles how it's the power of God to acknowledge
1:02:37
that to acknow it's not the prayer it's not the words it's to acknowledge the power of God that works but that's the
1:02:43
heart of God he wants to heal he wants to deliver and so I'm I'm I also had a
1:02:50
there was a like a a like a small group not doesn't belong here but maybe in Las
1:02:56
Vegas we will do that too like it was my turn to teach in a Bible study group on
1:03:01
Friday and it turns out to be the same day as the Portland revival and I it was
1:03:07
my turn to lead so I had them turn TV on and we were watching you. We were watching re revival.
1:03:14
Yeah. So many people now in Vegas know about you and and um and I'm hoping in
1:03:21
the Middle East as well because I I you know I could serve there. I could do something and yes I I had come in here
1:03:29
also and I you prayed for my son because it's been three years he hasn't been
1:03:34
contacting me and uh uh he was oppressed but I believe your word went through you
1:03:40
you said I I declared the spirits and and you mentioned the spirit of murder and and spirit of death and spirit of
1:03:49
anxiety and everything must go and you declared him free and I never understood
1:03:55
the I never heard you much saying the spirit of murder and I never understood until like a week ago I'm thinking oh my
1:04:01
goodness yes when he was little in the neighbors two children were murdered and
1:04:06
that affected him so much and how you received that as well and you he hasn't
1:04:12
it's been eight months since that prayer but I believe in God's timing he hasn't yet but but the word went through like
1:04:19
you always say the went forth so so I believe it But I I'm here to be under
1:04:25
the waterfall of the anointing like you said one time in your post. And uh and I
1:04:31
just want more anointing. You know, school starts tomorrow and I need more favor, more anointing with these kids.
1:04:36
And and and I need more anointing. And I'm just I just want to be in fire for
1:04:43
God. Amen. Amen. Come here. Hallelujah.
1:04:48
I am so proud of you. And God is so proud of you for how you have embraced
1:04:54
him fully, his ways, his revival. And he has been using you mightily. Hallelujah.
1:05:01
I see this is just the beginning. And it's going to keep increasing. This revival fire that has been unleashed in
1:05:10
Las Vegas and through you. It's going to keep increasing. May more of this anointing come upon you and touch all of
1:05:17
the children, all of the people that you pray for in the schools. Let eyes open up more. Let more miracles take place in
1:05:25
Jesus' name. Let there be increase. Increase of fire, increase of this
1:05:30
revival in Jesus' name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:05:37
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:05:45
And you from Switzerland, you can come next.
1:05:54
Hallelujah. Hi, welcome. So, would you like to share your testimony of how God has touched you at
1:06:01
5F? I started to see you on YouTube shorts about two and two of years ago
1:06:08
and I was so touched about you and what you did and I said to my husband I'm
1:06:15
looking in Jesus eyes. This woman is so different and what she says and what she
1:06:21
does is the truth. I really felt it in my heart and I start to watch all these
1:06:27
things and there was a wish in my heart who grows that I would like to do the
1:06:32
same things and in May last year on our wedding day and the morning I clicked
1:06:38
YouTube and I saw that you were coming to Berlin and I said to my husband that's my wedding gift we go to Berlin
1:06:45
in July and then we have uh we went to Berlin and you did the importation
1:06:53
And I can't say I felt something and we went home and week and week and week
1:06:59
passed. And there was uh one week one day before Christmas when our nephew was
1:07:05
in our house. He has different problems with drugs with so many things. And he
1:07:11
was with us for lunch this day. And after lunch I told him you need prayer.
1:07:19
You have demons. And he said yes. And I said we have to look for something who
1:07:24
can pray with you. And I prepared myself to go back to the office. And then I
1:07:30
said to my husband, we pray with him. And the start I started praying for him.
1:07:36
And then demons manifested. He was screaming. He was vomiting. He was
1:07:41
crying. Everything together. My h my son came down because he thought our nephew
1:07:48
would attack us because he was crying so hard. And I said, "Everything okay. That's Jesus. That's really Jesus." And
1:07:55
I was so surprised that something happened when I prayed for him because I
1:08:01
never had it before. I I didn't know that. And I went back to the office. I
1:08:07
came to the office and I saw that in my ring I had a gold ring around diamonds
1:08:13
and one diamond was missing and in the evening I told my husband one diamond is missing and he said don't
1:08:20
worry be lucky our nephew is free I said yes and in the evening when we go to bed
1:08:27
I thought to myself I prayed I said Lord when I find this diamond I know I have
1:08:34
the importation The other day it was Christmas day. We had a lot of people in our house. We
1:08:39
were moving our living room for all these people and we had dinner and after
1:08:46
dinner part of the family went home and I was just with my family as my
1:08:52
children, my husband and I was moving my shoe like this and I said there's
1:08:57
something in my shoe. I turned my shoe and the little diamond was inside
1:09:03
and I had the answer of God. Yes, I have it. And then I don't know if you want to do
1:09:10
the the rest because we church. So, I'm a part-time pastor of a very
1:09:18
small community. It's a evangelist Baptist church and
1:09:25
quite a a lot of the people are sick and that shouldn't be. So what we are
1:09:32
looking for is more impartation, more
1:09:38
blessings from Jesus in order to give it to these people in the community
1:09:45
and that is what we are looking for. So helping people being closer to Jesus,
1:09:54
having a a sound life and being able to
1:09:59
live and give testimony about Jesus and that would be what we are looking for.
1:10:07
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God in indeed had released impartation to
1:10:14
you in Berlin because he can trust you. because he can trust you both. And he's
1:10:19
brought you here to receive more to spread this revival, to spread his power
1:10:24
and his love to the people in this church that you're ministering at and beyond. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. I
1:10:32
release impartation of anointing upon you now. Receive this power of God. When
1:10:38
you pray for the people in the church and beyond, may they be healed and delivered. Let revival spread through
1:10:46
you. Receive this now in Jesus' name. May this anointing move through you
1:10:52
mightily. May it increase in you now. And may more miracles take place through you. And may revival spread through you
1:10:59
both mightily in Switzerland. Receive it now in Jesus name.
1:11:05
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:11:19
Such glorious testimonies of impartation. Hallelujah.
1:11:26
God's power is moving all over the world. All over the world. Not just
1:11:32
right here, but it's being spread. It has spread all over the world. Hallelujah.
1:11:39
Woo Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Well, we're get going
1:11:45
to get into the word of God right now. I have titled this message the spirit of
1:11:52
Caleb and Joshua. Numbers 14:24.
1:12:00
But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit
1:12:06
and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, the
1:12:12
promised land. and his descendants will inherit it.
1:12:18
So this is spoken of Caleb. But all throughout scripture when we read about
1:12:24
Caleb and Joshua, they are united and together in the spirit and heart. And
1:12:33
they both went out to scout the promised land to see what it looked like and what
1:12:38
they were up against, what their enemies looked like so that they could have a uh
1:12:44
a strategy and know and not go in there blindly. Amen. And they were the only
1:12:52
two that gave a good report, the true report, meaning that
1:12:59
God would give them the land. they would have victory. Hallelujah. So this is why I titled it
1:13:06
the spirit of not only Caleb but also of Joshua as well. So um I shared last
1:13:15
Sunday about how Caleb and Joshua were the only ones who
1:13:23
made it out of Egypt and into the promised land.
1:13:28
It would have been the next generation besides Caleb and Joshua that actually
1:13:33
entered into the promised land because it was only Caleb and Joshua, besides Moses, who had a different spirit,
1:13:43
a different spirit, a spirit that followed God wholeheartedly.
1:13:49
That is why God brought them into the promised land and he did not allow
1:13:55
anyone else. They ended up dying in the wilderness. So
1:14:01
today I want to share with you how to have a spirit like Caleb and Joshua
1:14:08
because this is your calling. This is you are we are the Joshua generation.
1:14:14
Yes. Hallelujah. The generation that is entering the promised land of
1:14:20
revival, of lasting revival, of the endtime revival. This is us. Hallelujah.
1:14:27
Um, but you need to rise up to this calling. You need to know how to make
1:14:34
sure you're really having this spirit of Caleb and Joshua so you do enter in the
1:14:39
promised land and so you can help all the others who aren't there yet
1:14:47
know the right way to go. So that you can be leaders. You can be an example
1:14:52
like Caleb and Joshua were examples. They were leaders that led the way. This
1:14:58
is the right spirit to have. This is the heart to have. This is the faith we must have. This is how we should behave and
1:15:04
act. This is how to be real warriors of God. Their leadership is what led to the
1:15:13
next generation of Israelites to be molded into the image of God, to be like
1:15:18
Caleb and Joshua with this different spirit to be able to go into the promised land. So this is your calling
1:15:26
to be a leader like Caleb and Joshua to lead those who are spiritually immature
1:15:32
currently, who are lukewarm, whose eyes aren't opened up yet.
1:15:38
It's your calling to lead them, to be an example for them, for your light to
1:15:43
shine so brightly that they see the light in you and can find Jesus and his power and the
1:15:52
answers, the the the truth through you. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:15:59
So, we're going to go to Numbers 13:25.
1:16:06
After exploring the land for 40 days, the men returned to Moses, Aaron, and
1:16:11
the whole community of Israel at Cadesh in the wilderness of Piran. So what's
1:16:16
happening before this? The context is that a bunch of men were sent into the
1:16:23
promised land. They were sent into this land to scout it out. So they've
1:16:28
returned now after 40 days. They reported to the whole community what
1:16:34
they had seen and showed them the fruit they had taken from the land. This was
1:16:39
their report to Moses. So there was a whole big group of them. It wasn't just Joshua and Caleb. So this
1:16:45
is the majority of the people. This was their report of what they saw. We entered the land you sent us to explore
1:16:51
and it is indeed a bountiful country, a land flowing with milk and honey. Here
1:16:58
is the kind of fruit it produces. But the people living there are powerful and
1:17:04
their towns are large and fortified. We even saw giants there. The descendants
1:17:10
of Anoch. The Amalachites live in the Negev and the Hittites. Jeb Jebusites
1:17:15
and Amorites live in the hill country. The Canaanites live along the coast of Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan
1:17:21
Valley. But Caleb tried to quiet the people as
1:17:27
they stood before Moses. Ah, no. Let's go on and take the land.
1:17:32
He said, "We can certainly conquer it." Completely different report.
1:17:40
Completely different spirit. Verse 31. But the other men who had explored the
1:17:45
land with him disagreed. We can't go up against them. They are stronger than we are. So they spread
1:17:53
this bad report about the land among the Israelites.
1:17:59
The land we traveled through and explored will devour anyone who goes to live there. All the people we saw there
1:18:05
were huge. We even saw giants there, the descendants of Enoch. Next to them, we
1:18:11
felt like grasshoppers. And that's what they thought, too.
1:18:16
Chapter 14 verse1. Numbers chapter 14:1. Then the whole community. So the all the
1:18:22
Israelites began weeping aloud and they cried all night. Their voices rose in a
1:18:28
great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron. If only we had died in Egypt
1:18:34
or even here in the wilderness, they complained. Why is the Lord taking us to this country only to have us die in
1:18:41
battle? Our wives and our little ones will be carried off as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?
1:18:49
Then they plotted among themselves, let's choose a new leader and go back to Egypt. Forget Moses.
1:18:56
Verse 5. Then Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground before the whole community of Israel. Two of the men who had explored the land. Joshua son of Nun
1:19:03
and Caleb son of Jeffa tore their clothing. They said to all the people of Israel, "The
1:19:11
land we traveled through and explored is a wonderful land. And if the Lord is
1:19:16
pleased with us, meaning if we can continue to obey him and be in good
1:19:22
standing like we currently are, he will bring us safely into that land
1:19:27
and give it to us. It is a rich land flowing with milk and honey. Do not
1:19:34
rebel against the Lord. Do not rebel against the Lord by giving into doubt,
1:19:42
by giving into the voices of the devil, saying that Moses isn't who he says he
1:19:49
is. Do not rebel against the Lord by going your own way, what seems right, what
1:19:56
seems best in your eyes, because of pride. Do not rebel against the Lord.
1:20:02
And don't be afraid of the people of the land. They listen to this part. This is
1:20:07
powerful. They are only helpless prey to us.
1:20:15
This is what this is the different spirit of Joshua and Caleb. These massive giants that make you feel
1:20:22
like grasshoppers are helpless prey.
1:20:29
They have no protection.
1:20:36
But the Lord is with us.
1:20:44
Don't be afraid of them, of those giants.
1:20:49
But the whole community began to talk about stoning Joshua and Caleb,
1:20:57
these people. Then the glorious presence of the Lord
1:21:02
appeared to all the Israelites at the tabernacle. And the Lord said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me
1:21:08
with contempt? Will they never believe me, even after all the miraculous signs
1:21:13
I have done among them? I will disown them and destroy them with a plague. Then I will make you into a nation
1:21:20
greater and mightier than they are."
1:21:26
So the word of God is so powerful because the word of God comes alive in
1:21:32
our life. The God that we read about in this story is the same God who is alive
1:21:38
today and who and who is with us today. And
1:21:44
and the the the devil in the Bible moving in the Bible is the same devil
1:21:49
today with the same schemes. The sk the same schemes he had to move through people to try to intimidate and scare
1:21:59
and falsely accuse God's people. It's the same schemes today.
1:22:05
But God's people always have victory that it just happens again and again
1:22:11
throughout the word. So that truth remains the same today. God's people will always have victory. Always.
1:22:18
Hallelujah. So this story we we can see the same story
1:22:26
happening in today's time because this story of the people being delivered out
1:22:33
of Egypt going in the wilderness and entering in the promised land. This is
1:22:38
so much like what God is doing today in this global revival that will never end
1:22:46
and will keep growing and growing that he has brought today. So
1:22:52
the people of God who have been in church bound by religion,
1:22:59
the devil keeping people blinded from the love of God. The devil has been keeping people
1:23:06
blinded of God's power for so long in the church.
1:23:12
Pretty much maybe all of us here, probably all of us here, that is our
1:23:17
story. We have all been in Egypt as believers in Jesus Christ.
1:23:25
We had been bound in one way or another. For me, I was bound by religion.
1:23:31
For me, I was bound by lukewarmness. I was bound. My eyes were not open up to
1:23:36
God's love, to God's power. And I was stuck in a cycle never transforming.
1:23:42
A cycle of condemnation. Going to church week after week, multiple times a week,
1:23:48
serving five services a day at a church, but staying the same, not knowing what
1:23:53
was wrong with me, and constantly condemning myself, constantly hearing
1:23:59
the angel of light. The devil masqueraded himself as an angel of light speaking these condemning religious lies
1:24:06
to me. That was my Egypt. And for some many of you, that was your Egypt, too. For others, you had even more bondage,
1:24:12
different bondage. Bondage of addiction, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, poverty, generational curses, sickness.
1:24:19
But, but many of you, if not all of you, have been in Egypt as a believer.
1:24:25
You've been going to church. You were going to church, but you were in Egypt.
1:24:30
You were in bondage. You were far from the promised land.
1:24:37
And now God has brought revival. God God has delivered me. He has
1:24:45
delivered all of you out of Egypt, out of the bondage of religion, out of the
1:24:51
bondage of spiritual blindness where you do not see God's love. You do
1:24:57
not how to have relationship with God. And you do not know how to be free from the devil's grip. He has delivered us
1:25:02
from that with his mighty hand doing signs and wonders and miracles. Our eyes
1:25:08
have opened up. We have been set free from the captivity we were in and our
1:25:15
ancestors were in for hundreds of years. We have been set free. Hallelujah.
1:25:22
Hallelujah. [Applause] And we are now we are we are we we we
1:25:29
have stepped into the promised land in in a certain way. But there's so much
1:25:34
more of the promised land we have yet to step into in terms of the revival. in
1:25:40
terms of this global revival, in terms of the acceptance, the acceptance of
1:25:46
God's move, in terms of all the different places God wants his revival,
1:25:52
his word, his power, his new wine to extend to.
1:25:57
There's a a big area of the promised land we have not entered yet, and we are on our way. Hallelujah.
1:26:07
So we as a revival army, we are like the
1:26:12
Israelites who have been set free and who are on
1:26:18
our way to step fully into the promised land
1:26:23
where there is no constraints, no limits on God's move, on God's revival.
1:26:31
Hallelujah. And so I can tell you now it's it it has
1:26:37
been more than eight years now of ministry for me of Five-fold church and
1:26:44
it has been it has been since 2021 so more than four
1:26:50
years that revival has broken out and gone global.
1:26:55
And I can tell you that there have been and still continue to be religious
1:27:01
giants occupying the promised land. There have been religious giants that
1:27:08
have been conquered. Hallelujah. There have been many religious giants
1:27:14
year after year after year. And we have gained more territory, more territory of the promised land.
1:27:22
Hallelujah. And I'm telling you that every time I saw one of those religious giants, they
1:27:29
looked massive and I felt like a grasshopper. Every time I I I I encountered attacks,
1:27:40
false accusations, different kinds of evil schemes. I couldn't even make I couldn't even
1:27:46
imagine lies just made up completely out of thin
1:27:51
air. Every time that I encountered those, it
1:27:57
felt like a massive religious giant and I felt like a tiny grasshopper.
1:28:02
But I thank God that he has given me a different spirit, a spirit like Caleb
1:28:09
and Joshua. And praise God. Glory to God.
1:28:16
And I and I'm so thankful, you know, mo Joshua and Caleb, they had Moses to imitate. They they received impartation
1:28:24
of a different spirit from their spiritual father Moses. And that's what I had in my spiritual father prophet Dr.
1:28:30
Joe Davyy. I have that different spirit because of that impartation from him.
1:28:36
Because of the heart, the the heart of faith, the giant of faith that he is.
1:28:42
Seeing his example and seeing him and listening to his words encouraging me and listening listening to his own
1:28:48
testimony of how he has faced those religious giants before and how those relig religious giants have been
1:28:53
defeated year after year after year after year every single time and and
1:28:58
valuing that word, you know, instead of being like the Israelites and questioning Moses when they encountered
1:29:05
obstacles. By God's grace, I didn't question my Moses. I didn't question
1:29:13
um prophet Dr. Davi my spiritual father. I valued his words and I believed the
1:29:18
words of God coming through him encouraging me to keep going that these
1:29:24
religious giants must be conquered and God will give me will give us will give
1:29:30
his move his army victory every time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:29:37
And I've seen these different religious giants look different each time. A different kind of intimidation. Uh
1:29:45
bigger and bigger and bigger and feeling even smaller. But each time I've seen God bring victory.
1:29:52
Each time I've seen those religious giants be conquered. I've seen God
1:29:58
silence the voices, the accusers. Where are your accusers now?
1:30:05
They've been silenced. Hallelujah. I've seen God prepare a table in the
1:30:12
presence of my enemies time after time again. I by by by by by by God
1:30:19
increasing his revival, increasing the fruit, increasing the miracles, the
1:30:24
testimonies, the testimonies keep increasing. Glory to God. And this is
1:30:30
this is how God prepares a table in the presence of our enemies. The enemies that say that the the anointing is not
1:30:37
real, that say that woman can't preach, that make up lies and speak against the anointing and speak against me to speak
1:30:44
against my spiritual father. The the all of these different lies all of these
1:30:50
different lies. They have been silenced and they are they are in the table
1:30:56
watching watching that their that they have been
1:31:01
silenced that their lies cannot stand. They cannot have impact. They cannot
1:31:06
have lasting impact. It can't happen. It may seem like temporary impact but it cannot be lasting impact. Hallelujah.
1:31:16
I the word of God is so powerful. Um this different spirit of uh uh Caleb and
1:31:25
Joshua, oh is powerful because Caleb and Joshua, they said this,
1:31:32
don't be afraid of the people of the land. They are only helpless prey to us.
1:31:39
They have no protection, but rather the Lord is with us. So we
1:31:45
don't just have we don't just have protection but we have
1:31:50
perfect everlasting protection. There can't be a more powerful
1:31:56
protection than what we have. If it's a security system on a house, it's like a
1:32:03
billion of them or something. I mean, you can't even imagine the perfect protection we have with God on our side.
1:32:12
So, um, these religious giants, the religious giants that oppose revival,
1:32:18
that oppose the anointing, that oppose deliverance, that oppose everything that Jesus is doing in his move, all the
1:32:25
different ways he moves his in his new wine. They are helpless prey, these religious giants, and they have no
1:32:31
protection. Now, they can seem more powerful. It can seem like there's more of them, but in
1:32:37
reality, they have no protection. They are all talk.
1:32:44
Like the lies, the lies and the schemes have no protection
1:32:51
because lies can never stand. They will be exposed.
1:33:01
And and our job, this vision that that God has given us is to build his army.
1:33:08
is is is is to is to shine our lights to attract people
1:33:15
to come to Jesus for true children of God to be birthed. True children of God.
1:33:21
Our job is not to convince the world of something. Is not to convince everybody
1:33:27
to believe in Jesus. Everybody has free will. Everybody has
1:33:34
free will. So our job is to shine our lights, speak the truth, demonstrate the
1:33:42
power of God so that those who want Jesus can find him
1:33:49
and can and can be birthed into the kingdom and become children of God. And
1:33:56
our job is to then make disciples is to equip them to be warriors of God in this
1:34:01
revival army. That's our job. So what is so powerful
1:34:08
is that all of the people that
1:34:14
will be children of God that that that have hearts that have pure hearts that
1:34:20
want God. God will give them eyes to see the
1:34:25
truth. He absolutely will. He's done it for you.
1:34:31
He's going to do it for many more. and millions more. He gives discernment
1:34:39
to his children. He gives you discernment.
1:34:45
He will give every other person out there who truly has a heart for him
1:34:50
discernment. And this is what God has taught me because honestly the lies and the false
1:34:56
accusations seemed like really big giants to me. Really big giants. Like I
1:35:02
would have thoughts I would have thoughts of like how will people know the truth?
1:35:09
How if people are speaking so passionately a lie?
1:35:15
Won't a lot of people just believe them because people are naive and maybe
1:35:21
they'll think, well, why would they make something up? You know, but the Lord has taught me year after
1:35:27
year after year as I've gone through this that he really gives his people
1:35:32
discernment. He really speaks to his people. He
1:35:38
speaks to you. He really speaks and he shows. He opens up eyes and he shows
1:35:45
people what is true and what is false.
1:35:50
So this is what God wants you to know because this is I mean this was the biggest
1:35:56
scheme against Jesus was the false accusations and lies. This is what led him to being crucified. The Pharisees so
1:36:03
passionately and adamantly were speaking lies and false accusations against Jesus. He's a false prophet. They would
1:36:10
say he's using demonic powers. They would say he's going against the word of God. Here's even the proof. They would
1:36:17
say that was all they had. That was
1:36:24
literally that was their weapons against Jesus. That was the persecution that Jesus
1:36:30
faced. That was what led him to be crucified. And it's the same thing for the disciples of Jesus. I it this is the
1:36:38
same scheme of the devil. But so so you need to understand it's the same thing today. It's the same
1:36:45
scheme today. But what God wants you to know today is
1:36:50
that these giants sending lies, sending false accusations, coming adamantly
1:36:55
coming against the work of God, they are helpless prey.
1:37:01
And their lies, their schemes have no protection.
1:37:08
Their lies carry no power.
1:37:13
And I'm telling you, I can testify this with joy, with confidence, because I've
1:37:18
seen this in my life. I've seen God build such a big revival army. I'm seeing now
1:37:24
small five of church small group leaders, for example. I'm seeing them a big army of them, 40 plus groups,
1:37:33
strong and mature and a heart for Jesus. A re They have hearts for Jesus. They have hearts for
1:37:40
God's people. They have hearts for revival. It It didn't matter all that the devil
1:37:46
did. Nothing stopped. In fact, it was a catalyst.
1:37:52
It was a catalyst for God to build his army, to put fire in hearts, to
1:37:57
strengthen his army.
1:38:03
And it's just proved to me as I've seen this revival army grow, as I've seen true disciples
1:38:09
and and and and you children of God really grow and mature.
1:38:15
This is evidence that these schemes of the devil coming through the religious giants, these lies, these false
1:38:22
accusations, they carry no power. All talk, no power, no protection.
1:38:29
The truth is what stands and people will see the truth. Hallelujah.
1:38:35
[Applause]
1:38:43
So in order to have a have a spirit of Joshua and Caleb, you you have to
1:38:51
believe our God in what he says in his word.
1:38:57
If God is for us, who can be against us? Who
1:39:03
greater is he who is in us than he who is in the world?
1:39:09
God has revealed to you these miracles and signs and wonders in your life. You've seen just like the just like the
1:39:15
Israelites, they had seen all these signs and wonders and miracles. They had experienced deliverance. They had prayed
1:39:21
for coming out of Egypt. They had tasted and seen that God is a God of miracles.
1:39:27
He is bigger than Pharaoh who was the biggest kind of giant in those days.
1:39:33
They saw it with their own eyes. We must we must believe that God is who
1:39:38
he says he is and who he has proved to us that he is. He has proved to you already that he can conquer giants in
1:39:45
your life. So what about the new giants coming? This is the different spirit that Joshua
1:39:51
and Caleb had. They remembered what God did for them in the past.
1:39:58
They remembered that that God defeated Pharaoh, the biggest kind of giant with the
1:40:04
hardest heart who said, "No, no, no. Absolutely not.
1:40:09
Never." And God defeated him.
1:40:16
So what about the giants in the promised land in the land of Canaan?
1:40:21
What about them? They are going down just like Pharaoh went down.
1:40:30
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This is the different spirit
1:40:37
of Joshua and Caleb that you must have.
1:40:42
Don't be like the rest of the Israelites that forgot what God did,
1:40:48
that forgot what who who God proved himself to be already. God has done
1:40:53
enough in your life. You got to remember and value what he's shown you. He
1:40:59
doesn't change. He doesn't lie. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And
1:41:05
he will keep bringing you victory after victory after victory. The giants look different. They can even
1:41:12
look bigger. But he will keep bringing you victory every single time.
1:41:18
Hallelujah. [Applause]
1:41:24
So in Numbers 14:24 it says, "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I
1:41:32
will bring him into the land he went to and his descendants will inherit it." So
1:41:38
having a different spirit like Caleb and Joshua, it means part of it is meaning
1:41:43
to follow God wholeheartedly. And following God wholeheartedly,
1:41:49
a meaning of this is following God's vision.
1:41:56
Following God's vision because it was God's vision to take them out of the
1:42:02
land of Egypt where they were slaves. and to turn them into sons, to turn them
1:42:08
into victors. You know, in Egypt, they were at the lowest level. They were
1:42:14
slaves. And the people who worshiped other gods, Pharaoh and his people. They
1:42:21
were were were were in charge of the land. They had authority over the land.
1:42:28
But God wanted to turn them into turn them out of bring
1:42:34
them out of slavery and transform them into sons and those who would rule the land and walk in authority to bring
1:42:42
about God's will on this earth. Amen. And so, but in order to do that, it had
1:42:49
to be done God's way, not just any old way. That's going to be a big process to be turned from a slave to a son who has
1:42:58
dominion. So, you're going from the lowest level to the highest level.
1:43:03
That's going to take quite a a a process to bring about that change. And so,
1:43:11
the the the Israelites, they didn't besides Joshua and Caleb, they did not want that.
1:43:19
They chose to not be a son and have dominion. They chose
1:43:26
to remain slaves because in the scripture that I just read, they said,
1:43:32
"We prefer to turn back to Egypt. We prefer to rise up a new leader who
1:43:40
will bring us back into slavery." That's what they were saying when they
1:43:45
said, "It would be better if you left us in Egypt. find a new leader and bring us back to Egypt. So they were choosing
1:43:51
that. They were choosing to go against God's vision. They wanted their own
1:43:56
vision because they wanted comfort. They wanted things to be predictable.
1:44:04
They didn't want to be people of faith who had to depend on God. And they
1:44:10
didn't want change.
1:44:16
But Caleb and Joshua had a different spirit. They they followed go God wholeheartedly. They surrendered their
1:44:21
lives. Surrendered their vision and what they wanted and their comfort
1:44:26
to follow God wholeheartedly, which means following God's vision for their lives.
1:44:36
So I mean this is exactly how it is today. God is turning you from slaves into sons
1:44:44
and daughters who will have dominion on this earth.
1:44:53
Not just not just a little dominion, but like
1:44:58
God's ways, his new wine. This must be the standard for the body of Christ.
1:45:08
So it is this is God's vision. This is God's will. Not for us to have a little
1:45:13
comfortable tiny revival with a few hundred people.
1:45:20
No, it's God's will for us to have this dominion, us to lead the way, us to as
1:45:28
warriors of God to lead the way with the new wine, with demonstrating God's power, with releasing impartation, with
1:45:36
making disciples in the whole body of Christ.
1:45:43
This is not about a one church thing. I'm saying this is about God's global revival. Like this is God. This revival
1:45:50
that God has brought where he has poured out his anointing where he has where he is pouring out apostles and prophets
1:45:57
where he has poured out his new wine revelation. This is for the whole world.
1:46:04
This is not just for one church or about one church but it is about who will
1:46:09
receive this revival.
1:46:14
And so for all who will receive, for all who will follow Moses, for all who will
1:46:20
get in line with God's vision and leave the old behind, leave the old ways
1:46:26
behind, leave the religion and tradition and no transformation in the church, but
1:46:33
lots of entertainment and socializing to leave that behind
1:46:39
and get in line with God's new wine. wine ways for all who will get in line with God's
1:46:47
new wine ways and receive his new move. He is calling all of you, all of us to
1:46:54
take dominion in the body of Christ. Like to for this to be the standard, God
1:46:59
is purifying and transforming his bride. There must be the power of God in every
1:47:04
church. There must be purity and holiness in leadership that that trickles down to
1:47:10
the whole body of Christ. the whole church. In every church,
1:47:16
there must be there must be a spiritual hospital in every church. There must be
1:47:21
deliverance and healing released to people in every church.
1:47:27
There must be the power of God that raises the deaf to life. In every
1:47:32
church, there must be the power of God that opens blind eyes, opens deaf ears, opens
1:47:39
up mute mouths in every church.
1:47:44
Hallelujah. This is God's will
1:47:51
that the body of Christ goes into the promised land of a global revival. A
1:47:58
bride that is pure, blameless, spotless, without wrinkle, that is prepared for the return of Jesus. This is God's will.
1:48:07
This is God's vision, for the whole body.
1:48:13
So for that to happen, we have to rise up and be leaders, be examples for the
1:48:18
body of Christ. We have to take dominion in the body of Christ and speak this is what God says. This is what God is doing
1:48:26
now. and not be shy about it, not care what people think. This is what God is
1:48:32
doing. He is moving in power. He is delivering people from demonic spirits.
1:48:38
He is healing the sick. He is moving through apostles and prophets just like he did in the book of Acts. He's doing a
1:48:46
new thing. And this is what he wants to do in every
1:48:52
church boldly and confidently speaking. this, living this, testifying about this. This
1:48:59
is your calling. This is our calling. This is how we walk in dominion as sons
1:49:05
and daughters of God. No longer slaves. No longer bound by religion and bound by
1:49:12
people pleasing, caring what people think. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:49:21
Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:49:26
So to follow God's vision, in order to follow God's vision,
1:49:31
we have in in order to follow God's vision, he's taking us to a promised land, a land with so much fruit, a land
1:49:37
where so many souls are saved, healed, and delivered. And a land also where you are experiencing abundant life, more
1:49:43
abundant life than you currently are because it's a reward of the increase of
1:49:49
following God and going into the promised land of his revival. He He blesses you for serving him. He It's
1:49:55
like Joshua, Caleb, and the Israelites. There was a great reward of enjoying this fruit once they followed God
1:50:03
wholeheartedly and his vision, putting his work first. In order to do this, you have to
1:50:10
whenever if you want anything great in life, anything above the norm and God's will of a great promised land of
1:50:17
abundant life, a land flowing of milk and honey, you have to get out of your comfort zone. You have to leave behind
1:50:23
your comfortable old life, the things of the past and you have to be you have to
1:50:30
embrace the journey. Anybody anybody like traveled to many
1:50:36
places here? Anybody encountered the the the the the
1:50:43
chaos of of flying, turbulence, delays,
1:50:48
cancellations, all of that headache. Yeah. Anybody say it's worth it?
1:50:58
But you know there's a lot of people who will not travel because they do not want the discomfort
1:51:04
of the journey. The thought of the headaches of the the the the travel, the planes and all that
1:51:11
that could happen. They'd rather stay home. And they're missing out on so much.
1:51:18
They're not just missing out on just the the the the the joy to see new creation
1:51:23
of God around the world, the different landscapes, the different people, the different cultures,
1:51:30
the all the blessings that come with it. But they're also missing out on growing
1:51:35
their perspective changing to not be to to to see the beauty of the world,
1:51:41
the beauty of God's people, the beauty of different cultures. It changes you. It humbles you. Especially when you're
1:51:47
an American, it really humbles you. If you haven't traveled, I speak doors to open up for you and you need to go
1:51:53
travel because because all Americans need it
1:51:59
humbles you. It humbles you uh because you can feel have that
1:52:04
ethnosentrism spirit otherwise. Um but that's how it is in the spiritual
1:52:12
realm. There are some people that they start on the journey like the Israelites did and then it gets uncomfortable.
1:52:19
It's the it's it's the same food every day even though it's coming miraculously.
1:52:24
It's so unpredictable. You thought you were going to get somewhere sooner, but instead you're
1:52:30
still in the wilderness. And some people just prefer the
1:52:36
predictability and the the the comfort of Egypt.
1:52:41
And so they they step away from God's calling, God's will, God's vision, and
1:52:47
return back to where they came from. So you need to know that to have this
1:52:54
different spirit like Caleb and Joshua did to follow God's vision, you have to
1:53:00
embrace the journey, embrace the discomfort that can come along the journey. Embrace the unpredictability,
1:53:07
the not knowing, the life of faith and dependency on God
1:53:13
and embrace the new. You have to have that spirit. You have
1:53:19
to have that attitude of acceptance of being flexible and adaptable
1:53:26
and selfless, not caring about your comfort. Amen. knowing that it's worth it to serve God and the promised land
1:53:33
will be worth it. Hallelujah. Isaiah 43:19, it says, "This is what the
1:53:39
Lord says. He He who made a way through the sea and a path through the mighty waters, who drew out the chariots and
1:53:45
horses, the army and reinforcements together, and lay there never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a
1:53:52
wick. Forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new
1:53:59
thing. Now it springs up. Do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.
1:54:08
Our God is a God who does new things. The Israelites had never left Egypt
1:54:14
before. They had never the the people of God in general had never done what God wanted to do through the Israelites.
1:54:21
They had never been brought into a promised land in the promised land. God continues to do new things.
1:54:30
He That's who he is. He's a God who does new things.
1:54:36
There was revival in the past, but when God brings a revival again, it will be a
1:54:41
new kind of revival. It will look different. In this revival, he's restoring things
1:54:47
that haven't been restored before since the book of Acts. things we haven't seen in the body of
1:54:54
Christ. Deliverance. He is restoring
1:55:01
not just to be in one little ministry, but all over. He's this is a new thing. He's doing
1:55:06
the anointing, his way of moving in power, putting his power in vessels, the way we see through
1:55:13
the word and then impartation being released so that the power of God is moving effortlessly, mightily through
1:55:19
people and being imparted where people like we all these testimonies we heard today so easily, God is moving through
1:55:26
them. It's because it's true anointing. The power of God that he puts in
1:55:34
vessels, not just anybody, but those he can trust. We've been missing this by and large in the body of Christ. And
1:55:41
this is part of the new thing that God is doing. He's moving through women
1:55:47
as well as men. This is a new thing by and large that he is doing.
1:55:53
He's using weak and foolish things in a greater way than what we have seen. This
1:55:59
is a new thing that he's doing. He's moving through apostles and prophets by
1:56:05
and large. This is a new thing he is doing. And
1:56:12
he's restoring the new wine. It says in Mark 2:18, "Now John's
1:56:19
disciples and the Pharisees were fasting." This is amplified version. It's powerful because the amplified version says it like this. Now John's
1:56:25
disciples and the Pharisees were fasting as a ritual. So therefore not led by God but doing it
1:56:33
as a ritual. Things we do just to do them as in performance of God as a
1:56:38
ritual as a tradition. It carries no power. It's not led by God. We are to do
1:56:44
everything led by God. That's where there's power. That's where
1:56:50
there's fruit. So when you fast, not led by God, but as a ritual. If you if you
1:56:56
take communion, not led by God, but done as a ritual.
1:57:01
If you pray as a ritual, but not not not connecting to God and led by the Holy
1:57:08
Spirit, but just saying words just to do as a ritual, no power. Everything we do for God should not be a
1:57:14
ritual, but we should include Holy Spirit and he should lead us. Amen.
1:57:20
So it says, "Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting as a ritual, and they came and asked Jesus, why are
1:57:25
John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting, but your disciples are not doing so?" Jesus answered, I'm going to skip on to verse
1:57:32
21. No one sews a patch of unshrunk new cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the
1:57:37
patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. No one puts new wine into old wine skins.
1:57:43
Otherwise, the fermenting wine will expand and burst the skins and the wine is lost as well as the wine skins. But
1:57:50
new wine must be put into new wine skins. So, this is part of his response
1:57:57
to why are your disciples and you not fasting in the way that we do in the way
1:58:05
that is ritual? And so this is a powerful answer that Jesus gives that teaches us revelation
1:58:12
about old wine versus new wine. Old wine is about rituals and traditions not led
1:58:18
by the Holy Spirit. Doing thing man's ways. Doing things in a way that can be people pleasing actually. Doing things
1:58:25
in a performative way. Performing to to get righteousness. Performing for people
1:58:30
so you can look really spiritual like a really good Christian. performing so that you can feel like a great
1:58:36
Christian. Performing to please people so that they say oh so that you don't have Pharisees
1:58:44
persecuting you. That's the old wine.
1:58:49
And that can apply to to so many things. All the things that God commands us to do in the word. praying, reading the
1:58:56
Bible, how we ministering to people, evangelizing, praying for people, how you pray for people, how you cast demons
1:59:02
out, offering, communion, how we do church teachings.
1:59:08
There can be old wine which is operating like the Pharisees
1:59:13
did out of religion and performative and people pleasing shutting out the leading of the Holy
1:59:19
Spirit doing things that or a comfort in a comfortable way that doesn't lead to
1:59:25
persecution or new wine. We can do things in the new wine which is the
1:59:32
doctrine of Jesus, the way of Jesus that he introduced
1:59:37
and it's led by the Holy Spirit and it attracts persecution
1:59:43
because it actually destroys the work of the devil when you operate in the new
1:59:48
wine because we're in a kingdom of God where there's principles and rules and laws in
1:59:55
the spiritual realm that God set up. So operating in the new wine is about
2:00:01
getting in line with God's principles. Like one brief example, if you can know
2:00:06
what I what I'm talking about is like the principle of authority.
2:00:12
So what makes a demon go is when a vessel of God has been entrusted with
2:00:18
anointing and authority. And when the vessel of God knows the authority they
2:00:23
carry, they don't let demons intimidate them. and fool them and they operate in their
2:00:30
authority effectively. So for everyone to scream out loud, we
2:00:38
all scream out loud together, demon go now. That's not how authority works.
2:00:46
This is why we see Apostle Peter when he ministered, people came under his shadow and all who came under his shadow were
2:00:52
healed and delivered. Where was the rest of the apostles casting out demons together with him? They weren't there.
2:00:58
It was just Peter. Because that's how authority works. We all have specific dominion and territory in the spiritual
2:01:04
realm. Like the stories of of impartation here from Switzerland, it was her nephew. She
2:01:12
prayed for her nephew and the demon went. She was operating in her territory, her family.
2:01:18
They are pastors in a church and they I release imation for them to pray for the people in their church. That is their
2:01:23
territory in their church. But for them to start casting out demons here, for example, would be outside of
2:01:30
their territory. And that's not even how it works because God has truly given a person when he's
2:01:36
given a person authority, it's authority for all demons to go. That's what happened in the times of Peter.
2:01:42
So when a vessel really carries authority, true authority, true anointing, if it if if the vessel says
2:01:48
every demonic spirit of addiction must go, now then if there are 40 people here
2:01:54
with addiction and 1,000 with addiction watching, then 140 demons of addiction
2:02:02
must go with one command.
2:02:08
So that's a little side note so you can understand what I am teaching now about
2:02:13
how God in his new wine, his new w Jesus's new wine way is about principles
2:02:20
in the spiritual realm. The new wine is the revelation
2:02:26
of God's ways of of of of his principles of how to operate as a child of God of
2:02:33
how to walk in the authority and anointing. That's why the woman that shared her impartation testimony, she shared that she she she did the walking
2:02:40
in miracles ecourse. That's my ecourse, by the way. You can find it on 5church.org website or apostle
2:02:45
cathernick.com under resources or link in bio. But she shared like I had to learn how to walk in the anointing
2:02:53
and be effective. Amen. So Jesus is saying we can't mix the old
2:02:59
and new wine together. You have to shed the old way completely and step fully
2:03:04
into the new wine. So to have this different spirit of
2:03:09
Caleb and Joshua and enter the promised land, you can't have one foot in Egypt
2:03:15
and one foot in the promised land. It won't work. So that means you're going to make a lot
2:03:20
of people angry. You're going to offend a lot of people because there's a lot of people in the old wine. This is the
2:03:28
beginnings of this revival. So there's a lot of people that don't understand the
2:03:33
old don't understand the new wine yet. And they may say that's not right. That's wrong. It's this way. You should
2:03:40
do it this way. You should pray this way. D. You'll encounter that. I've
2:03:45
encountered that. But I can't care what people think. If I'm going to have a
2:03:51
different spirit like Joshua and Caleb, if I'm going to enter the promised land. If I'm going to lead the way and help
2:03:56
others step into revival. And you can't either.
2:04:02
Joshua and Caleb, people were threatening. They they knew that they were going to make people mad. They knew
2:04:08
they were going to make people bad by speaking the good report. They knew it. And even they didn't cower down when the
2:04:15
people said, "Let's stone them." They didn't cower down. They didn't care what
2:04:21
people thought about them, said about them. They followed God wholeheartedly.
2:04:27
They accepted the new way fully. You need to be ready to step into this new
2:04:34
territory and leave the old way behind completely and not care what anybody has
2:04:40
to say about it. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:04:46
1 Corinthians 15:58. Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be steadfast and movable, always excelling
2:04:52
in the work of the Lord, always doing your best and doing more than is needed, being continually aware that your labor,
2:04:59
even to the point of exhaustion in the Lord, is not feudal nor wasted. It is never without purpose.
2:05:05
There's one last one last thing I want to share with you about how to have a different spirit like Caleb and Joshua.
2:05:13
They kept going for more than 40 years. They kept
2:05:19
marching. They kept moving. They kept moving forward. Despite all these obstacles, despite
2:05:25
disappointment, despite people trying to kill them, despite all the giants in the land, they kept moving forward. And this
2:05:33
is what God is speaking to all of you right now. Keep going. Keep the fire.
2:05:39
Keep marching confidently. confidently. The giants will come, but you will have
2:05:46
victory every time. Don't let the giants slow you down. Don't let any scheme of
2:05:52
the devil slow you down. Keep moving forward. We have more and more land to
2:05:58
conquer for Jesus in this revival. We got to keep going. Hallelujah.
2:06:05
I am so proud of I've seen so many of you. It has been I this is and this this
2:06:10
year it it's the year of acceptance and and God gave the direction to all of you
2:06:16
to all of you planet 5 church all of you who are accepting of God's move his revival he gave you this word that you
2:06:24
must shine your light
2:06:29
because it's a year of acceptance and so how we bring in the harvest how we lead
2:06:35
people who are now ready to receive how we lead them to Jesus is by shining our light. And I have seen
2:06:42
so many of you shine your light like I have never seen. I have seen so many of
2:06:47
you love on others, put others first, take time out of your days to spread
2:06:53
flyers about what God is doing in his revival and go up and talk to people and
2:06:58
share your testimony and use your social media for God's glory and just be
2:07:04
zealous, passionate, on fire for Jesus and his move and have this passion for
2:07:09
others to receive what you've received. I'm so proud of you. I've seen it and I I am so full of joy. God is so proud of
2:07:16
you. And I want to say to all of you, keep going. Keep going.
