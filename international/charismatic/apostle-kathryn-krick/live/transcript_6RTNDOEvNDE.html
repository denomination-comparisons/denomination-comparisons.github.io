Hi everyone. Welcome to the live stream today. Come on in. I hope you're having a
0:07
blessed day so far. I'm excited for all that God is going to do today. Write in the comments where you're watching from.
0:14
And be sure to share this live stream with everyone you know. I know God is
0:21
going to move powerfully through this live stream. I know he's going to move through the screen. He's going to come
0:27
and do miracles. He's going to bring healing and freedom. And I believe this
0:32
word today is going to be lifechanging. I believe that lies of the devil and the
0:38
ways the enemy has tried to keep some of you stuck. These lies, these strongholds
0:43
are going to be broken through this live. And I'm so expected. I'm so excited for what God is going to do.
0:51
Hallelujah. So, make sure you don't keep this blessing to yourself. Share this live
0:58
stream with your friends, your family, everybody on your social media pages. God is so faithful to move in power
1:06
every single live stream. So I I encourage you to share with excitement,
1:12
share with passion, share with faith. You know, there's so many examples in
1:18
the Bible of people who had faith for their friends or people who had faith for their family members. Like these
1:26
people, they were lowering this guy who couldn't walk. They were lowering him through the roof
1:32
of where Jesus was ministering. Their faith, their passion for to see their
1:38
friend be healed released the miracle to the friend. The
1:44
centurion soldier, his faith for his servant led for his servant to be
1:50
healed. And there's examples of parents who had faith for their child and their child
1:55
was healed. So I say that to say that when you share these live streams, you
2:01
should share with a heart of faith, a heart of expectancy that these people on your social media
2:07
pages, those that you know and those that you don't know. and just in the world in general because the amazing
2:13
thing about social media is that there's no it it's it's public when you share
2:18
and there's no limits to where that video that post can go to in the world
2:25
we're living in now in this the world of the algorithm. You know, you don't know just how far it
2:32
may reach somebody just by you being obedient and hitting share. So, I encourage you, have faith, have expectancy as you hit the share button,
2:40
as you share this right now for the people you do know and the people you don't know. Amen. So, write in the
2:47

6:56
right, we're going to get into the word right now. Today I am teaching kingdom
7:01
identity versus personality traits.
7:09
Checking to see if it's in focus. I think it is. I think it is as as long as as long I
7:16
think it's because I'm away. It's getting giving the illusion. Maybe
7:25
as long as the my the box is on my face, it should be in focus.
7:30
And it should stay in focus because I'm just going to keep looking at the camera, I think.
7:39
Hallelujah. All right. So, let me just check and make sure
7:45
everything's good before I get into it.
Message
7:58
All right. So, I'm teaching on kingdom identity versus personality traits. So,
8:05
first of all, I want to talk about your identity in Christ. Now when you have become a believer,
8:12
you have a new identity, a new identity than you had before you were a believer.
8:18
Now God has made you in his image. He has he has specifically formed you in
8:24
your mother's womb. He has made you so unique. What is so amazing and so powerful is that not a single person on
8:31
this on this world is the same as another person. And it wasn't done by
8:36
accident. God literally designed, created you, every single person
8:42
completely unique, completely unique and rare and special and valuable. And God
8:50
has given you qualities, giftings, um, a certain way of your personality
8:58
that is for a purpose and he's going to use to show himself in this world. He is
9:05
you were made in his image. So he reveals himself through you. You know,
9:11
there's certain people that have um different personalities that show
9:17
different parts of God's heart, different parts of him. I was thinking
9:24
today, I was think I was thinking about the five-fold ministry. I was thinking about how Jesus, he gave these gifts to
9:31
the body of Christ, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, and all of these gifts are different
9:37
ministries that the body of Christ needs. And they're all different. And Jesus,
9:46
when he came on this earth, he was all five. Like, he exhibited all five. He was
9:55
strong in all five. And today for apostles, prophets,
10:00
evangelical, pastors, and teachers, you can only be one. You can have other giftings. You can you can have like a pastoral gifting if you're an apostle,
10:07
for example, a prophetic gifting if you're an apostle. You can have um prophetic giftings as an evangelist,
10:13
etc. Uh but you can only be just one. And so
10:20
this is like how God has made all of us in a in a similar way is we are showing
10:26
his heart. We are showing different parts of him um in our uniqueness.
10:32
So your uniqueness is beautiful and you should never compare yourself to others
10:37
thinking like you weren't made as good as another
10:42
person or the personality you have isn't as good as other people. You should
10:48
never ever do that because God literally created you how he wanted and he saw
10:54
that it was good. He saw you were good. He saw that it was good and perfect how he created you. Hallelujah. Uh so first
11:03
of all, I just want to share that it's very important you you see that you were made unique and God wants you that way.
11:12
Um and there's such beauty in your uniqueness that reveals God that reveals
11:18
his heart when you become transformed to be like him. When you tr be transformed
11:23
by his spirit to be like him. Now these the way he made you, your giftings, your
11:29
personality will really shine. Before you become a believer, that's not the case. But when you receive the Holy
11:36
Spirit, now it's like all of you starts shining. All of the
11:42
different parts of you start shining and reaches people in a unique way that others can't. the way God made you
11:50
uniquely, you to shine. Like how the rainbow has different colors, it's like you're a unique color. Hallelujah.
11:57
Um, so all that being said, all that being said, at the same time,
12:05
when you become a child of God, you join a family of royalty, of kingdom
12:12
royalty. You become a royal child of the king, a son or daughter of the king.
12:20
That's who you are. You're a prince or princess. That's who you are truly.
12:27
The king of kings is your father. Uh and so what's very important is to
12:35
know is to learn the DNA of your father.
12:41
Learn the DNA of God. like to not be so stubborn and
12:50
like hold on to who you were, your personality and everything the way you
12:57
were before becoming a believer that you don't adapt and align and
13:05
transform into the king's DNA, the king of kings DNA.
13:12
So you you know you can't be what what you're what you're not supposed to be is is be who you are your personality
13:20
exactly how it was and how you acted how you behaved how you spoke even the same
13:27
when you become a believer but now just you don't swear for example
13:33
and that's the only change there may be some aspects of your
13:39
personality there may be some aspects of how you behave and even how you talk,
13:45
how you act that was influenced by the devil.
13:52
The devil uh he is in the business of
13:58
trying to change a person's identity, change change who a person's attracted
14:05
to, change how a person thinks, change how a person speaks, change how a person acts. that that's what the devil wants
14:13
to do because when he can change your identity, he can control you.
14:19
Um, he can control how you think. When you accept that change of identity, he can control how you act.
14:27
And there's a lot of people, you know, the devil came in as a child. Sometimes
14:32
it's a generational curse. Sometimes abuse happened, whether it's physical, sexual. Sometimes abuse or emotional
14:38
abuse has happened when someone is a child and it shapes their identity.
14:44
Their identity becomes something not godly. Their identity changes from even what
14:51
they were like before after that event, that open door
14:58
where the enemy came in and started speaking lies about their identity,
15:04
lies about how they should behave, lies about how they should speak.
15:11
So what's so important is when you become a believer, you need to understand that you have a new identity.
15:20
God has made you perfectly. But you have to learn how God wants to
15:26
use you uniquely you in his kingdom
15:34
rather than not changing in every way only changing in religious behaviors
15:41
probably like only changing in okay you don't swear okay you don't drink okay you don't sleep around okay now you're
15:47
reading the Bible um but other aspects of how you think speak, act, don't
15:54
change. No, we need to surrender everything to Jesus so that he can form
16:01
our new identity as a royal child of God.
16:08
It's so important for you all to look at your past and look at
16:17
ways the enemy tried to come in. Maybe it was traumatic events. Maybe it was rejection that happened. And if you
16:24
notice this shift, a shift in how you acted, a shift in how you spoke, a shift
16:30
in your personality since then, that wasn't particularly a
16:35
good shift. Maybe you saw as a fine shift, but honestly, maybe it was a demonic shift.
16:41
But you should be real with yourself and look in your past and see
16:48
how you used to act and be real with yourself. Is this really how God wants
16:54
me to be? My personality, how I act, how I speak, or did the enemy
17:00
come in some ways and influence things and then I changed and really the devil
17:05
was reshaping my identity? And if that's the case, you know, it
17:11
means that you have a lot of transformation to do. You have a lot of renouncing to do. Maybe you've renounced so much. Maybe you're completely
17:17
delivered, completely delivered from demonic oppression. But there's things you need to renounce that you haven't
17:22
yet. That is this now this like reason why you're not transforming
17:28
into the image of God at the speed that God wants. There's a reason why you're stagnant in certain areas.
17:35
You got to renounce these things. Um, we need to be the light of the worlds
17:45
and we need to make sure that we are how we be the light of the world is that we
17:51
make sure that we are representing Jesus rightly.
17:57
That's the big meaning of being the light of the world because Jesus is the light. So we are his representatives
18:04
who carry his light. We have to represent Jesus rightly. We are his ambassador, his ambassador, his
18:11
representative. Whoa, what a responsibility.
18:17
We are vessels. Yes, he uses us different. He uses us uniquely, but there needs to be
18:24
uh a a great similarity of all children of God. We need to really look like we
18:32
are children of the king. We need to look like him. We need to act
18:39
like him. We need to be servant-hearted. This is what it looks like. Being
18:44
servant-hearted, being selfless, putting others before yourself, being humble,
18:51
void of all pride, being loving of all people, including
18:56
your enemies. Loving with everything you do in action, in word, in how you're
19:02
thinking about people. because it will come out. How you're thinking will come out.
19:07
Being joyful, being peaceful, having self-control,
19:12
being patient. Galatians 5:22, but the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our
19:17
lives. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
19:24
So you need to look at your e at your personality,
19:31
how you act, how you speak, the things of about you that are unique.
19:38
Are any of these aspects of your personality, how you act, you speak,
19:43
not able to align with the fruits of the Holy Spirit?
19:49
Be real with yourself. If something's not aligning, then that means that you have to renounce that.
19:56
That means that God wants you to lay that part of you down, that part of your identity down.
20:05
Um, this is a big part of how we must be the light of the world.
20:10
So I said servant-hearted, humble, loving, joyful, peaceful, self-control, patience, goodness, faithfulness, the
20:15
fruits of the Holy Spirit, but also in line with God's order.
20:24
In line with God's order, that you are obedient to God's ways. That you are
20:32
obedient to be a disciple, a real disciple.
20:38
Like every person is called to be planted in one place in one church and
20:44
there will be a spiritual leader spiritual leaders and a spiritual leader that God is calling you to imitate like
20:50
how Paul said imitate me as I imitate Christ
20:56
in 1 Corinthians 11:1. So
21:03
it says in the book of acts that the the uh believers were devoted to the
21:08
apostles teachings. So you need to be devoted to these
21:15
teachings of your spiritual leader. You need to be imitating your spiritual
21:22
leader as they imitate Christ. You need to really be serious about this. You
21:28
know, so the these are powerful words. These are very powerful words that are not talked much about in the body of
21:33
Christ today. These scriptures like the scripture I share with in the book of acts it says
21:39
they devoted themselves to the teachings of the apostles. They devoted devoted is a very strong
21:47
word and that's the word in the Bible. That means really carefully listening,
21:53
being a a a being teachable like a child
22:00
and and and receiving those teachings, receiving those words as truly from God
22:06
and saying this is God speaking. This is God speaking. And you take it you take
22:14
it as really God speaking. You you take it so seriously. You change yourself. If
22:19
change is required, you meditate on this word. If this is a word that is like a
22:25
weakness for you, like a really big area where you have to change a word and a teaching that comes forth, you take it
22:31
so seriously, you meditate on it regularly, you repeat the teaching, you
22:36
make such intention, priority, you make it priority to
22:41
apply this word in your life.
22:47
There's some people that they're not devoted to the apostles teachings. I And I can I can see it. Like it's not
22:54
hard to see. It's like you you have to have your ears open.
23:01
You have to take it seriously. If it's something you never heard of before, something you don't know, something that
23:06
you need correction in, oh, I got to take this seriously or else
23:12
I'll forget. I got to write this down. I got to replay this. I I got to make
23:19
intention to make this change because I don't want to be out of God's will. I don't want to be someone who
23:25
doesn't grow. I don't want to be someone that's rebellious, someone that's disobedient.
23:30
That's a strong word that the Bible says, but that is the Bible is our instruction of how we should be children
23:37
of God, of how we should be disciples. And this is instruction where it says in the book of Acts that the believers were
23:44
devoted to the teachings of the apostles. So when you're not devoted to the
23:50
teachings of your spiritual leader or leaders, you will misrepresent Jesus.
23:57
That's one of the big meanings of imitate me as I imitate Christ. When Paul says this,
24:04
he's teaching them truth. He's teaching them truth that he lives by. He's teaching the people truth that he once
24:11
didn't know learned truth about God and his kingdom and how to follow him in the
24:16
spiritual realm. He took this truth he applied it in his life and that is how God
24:23
exalted him to be an apostle to be this leader walking in this mighty power of
24:29
God. So that's one of the big ways you
24:34
imitate you you imitate your spiritual leader is by being devoted to the teachings. That's one of the
24:42
biggest ways. So um
24:50
in this new wine, in this revival, God is pouring out his new wine and he is revealing his ways, his principles that
24:58
have by and large been lost in the body of Christ. This is a lot of new to many. It's a lot
25:06
of new. It's a lot of new to many of you. That means you need to be so
25:11
diligent to take these teachings seriously because
25:17
you you'll forget it. Otherwise, it won't stick. You'll divert back to
25:24
old ways and think it's okay and not see the seriousness of it. Um God has order. God
25:33
has his ways and these are revealed in teachings through your spiritual leaders in his word. And these teachings bring
25:41
revelation in the word. That's that's the gifting of apostles. That's the gifting of teachers. That's the gifting
25:46
of all fivefold ministers who carry teaching gifts who are called to teach. They have this grace to bring revelation
25:55
upon the word of God, the Holy Spirit's real meaning, what he's speaking through
26:01
this word. it all and then then and then it expands your spiritual eyesight to be able to hear and see God's voice as you
26:08
read the word of God on your own rather than hearing the old wine doctrine, the religious uh doctrine that you once read
26:16
the Bible through that that lens you once read the Bible through. So, um,
26:28
we must, you must be in line with God's
26:33
order. In line with God's order. And that's something that a lot of people miss
26:40
because in the old wine, it's a lot of out of order. It's a lot
26:46
of not following God's principles. It's a lot of doing things however way you
26:52
want. There's pride in there. Okay. So there there can be some people
26:58
who are like halfway in, halfway in the new wine,
27:05
but not staying totally in line with God's
27:12
order, his ways, his principles, his new wine, and diverting a bit to their old
27:19
ways, to the old wine, to religion. But today in the body of Christ, it is more
27:26
common to be in the old wine, to be religious. And so it's it's
27:34
it can be it can sneak up on somebody where they think they don't realize the seriousness of what they're doing
27:41
because such a majority is doing this same old wine religious thing disregard
27:48
and disrespect of God's order of his ways and his principles. So to be the
27:53
light of the world, to represent Jesus rightly, you need to be in line with
27:59
God's order and his principles, his ways.
28:05
Hallelujah. Um,
28:11
we must all come together as believers
28:16
and be alike with how we represent God.
28:22
We all must have these characteristics. This should be your your main
28:27
personality. Jesus personality. Servant-hearted,
28:33
humble, loving, joyful, peaceful, self have having self-control, patient, in
28:38
line with God's order.
28:44
That should be your Jesus personality. what matters the most.
28:52
And then there's the unique way God made you, unique way.
28:59
Maybe your sense of humor, maybe the way you talk, maybe the way you act, maybe the um
29:07
just the the the uniqueness that you are,
29:12
you have to make sure that that fits into the Jesus personality.
29:19
Some things might have to go. Now
29:25
I want to, you know, really reveal the scheme of the devil. the scheme of the devil to this scheme of the devil that
29:33
is to um
29:39
trick you into thinking a part of your personality,
29:45
a part of how you act, how you speak, how you are is you.
29:52
And like you but but it's it was actually shaped by the devil. But like you love it. you you love it,
30:00
you know, you you embrace it and it makes you the most comfortable
30:06
this aspect of your personality, how you speak, how you act. And so like you you hear these voices
30:12
all the time saying like that's you, that's who you are. It's beautiful how you are. Like never change. Like that's
30:17
just you. That could be the devil. When it's not when these certain aspects of your
30:24
personality are not filtering through aligning with these traits of
30:33
the Jesus personality, the G the fruits of the Holy Spirit.
30:41
Um when you have something very special,
30:48
very different about you. You let's I want to talk about when you were all
30:53
children slash teens slash 20s something slash maybe even now
31:00
but I'm generally talking about the past but it applies to now too. But
31:05
you some of you you maybe you had something different and unique about you
31:11
and you found that you faced a lot of rejection, maybe bullying,
31:19
maybe abuse because of that uniqueness about you,
31:25
because of how you spoke or acted or behaved in a certain way. And you knew you knew it was different. You knew it was you knew it was unique to you.
31:32
you knew it wasn't common. If that's the case,
31:38
there can be different factors as to why you found rejection happening.
31:45
You found mistreatment happening. Factor number one could be factor number
31:51
one could have been that people were jealous
31:56
because as I as I said the the the the the uniqueness that God has made us
32:03
is beautiful and sometimes people can really see it
32:09
shining. Other times maybe your uniqueness that needs the anointing to come upon it before people really see
32:15
that it shine. you know, like like for me, like for me, like like I don't know,
32:21
like growing up I I had giftings, but they were all kind of spread out. Like I
32:26
mean, singing and acting was my strongest gifting, but I didn't consider myself like the most
32:34
amazing singer in the world and actress in the world. It was I was in my I was a lead in my high school musical, but like
32:39
in a small town, you know, and um I played sports in um I played sports.
32:47
soccer and basketball, but I wasn't like the best athlete for sure. I was more
32:52
like average. Um, and so I I didn't really face too much a little
33:00
bit, but I didn't face too much jealousy because I wasn't
33:06
I didn't have this obvious gifting that was shining so much.
33:11
um I did really well in school but it wasn't like it was announced like my
33:17
grades and everything like stuff like that. So yeah, but then when this this
33:23
gifting of me was hidden, like how God made me uniquely me as an apostle and the things he put in me
33:30
that I didn't know about, like the ability to speak and preach
33:36
and have confidence to walk in authority and cast out demons and heal the sick.
33:43
and the joy that I had like I always had joy but these things God put in my put in me in my mother's womb
33:50
nobody saw that including me until the anointing came upon it and the prophetic word came upon that so it's different for people but other people their gift
33:58
like God gave them a certain gift um when and they it's seen when they're young and when the anointing comes on it
34:06
when they're older now it really shines but it can start like shining when you're young so maybe you had a certain
34:12
gifting that people saw and they were jealous of. So
34:21
because of your uniqueness, rejection may could have happened. The reason for
34:26
the rejection, the reason for the mistreatment could have been jealousy. People were jealous. You were shining so
34:34
bright. Um,
34:44
but also also though it might that might not have
34:52
been the reason you faced rejection. You faced mistreatment.
34:57
Another reason why you might have faced that and maybe it was repeating by the way is because there could have been an
35:04
oppression that attracted rejection,
35:10
attracted mistreatment, attracted abuse. It could have been a generational curse.
35:16
It could have been since you were young. It could have been a door you opened a door a door you didn't open but it was open in the spiritual realm. And then
35:22
there was this oppression that attracted it's like
35:28
there was an open door there in your life. So people with demons would be influ like
35:35
demons could see go there and reject this person like and a person can be led
35:42
to do that and that could have been why you saw that repeating.
35:49
There's some people that are in patterns of manipul manipulation in relationships, horrible relationships.
35:55
It could have started with this open door of letting the wrong person in close and never shutting that door.
36:02
Maybe, you know, never seeing the importance of valuing yourself and um
36:08
and renouncing past relationships, renouncing the past demonic soul tie. So, there's some people that get in this pattern where they're constantly not
36:14
valuing themselves, not seeing how dangerous it is to let the wrong person close, whether this is a close friend or
36:21
someone you're dating. Um, and it's like the devil knows this weakness and the devil knows you've opened this door and
36:26
you've never closed it. You never renounced it. And so he keeps sending
36:32
people that like to manipulate people that that that that are like
36:37
narcissists, people that are selfish, people that are prideful, and like easily mistreat people and treat people
36:43
how they want for their selfish gain. And the devil can send those people like to that specific person when that person
36:50
has that door opened. And even more so when there is like a curse, there is oppression upon that
36:57
person's life that leads to just more. So that can be a reason that's a totally
37:04
different reason why the rejection could have been happened. It could be a combination too.
37:11
And now the third reason why you a person might have faced rejection,
37:16
mistreatment because of their uniqueness.
37:21
It could be that the devil influenced you to behave a certain way
37:30
that was unattractive to people
37:38
like Maybe you would become very needy to close friends and
37:46
not independent or just constantly have to be with them or something like that.
37:52
Um, and just constantly having this need for one person to always be there or
38:00
something like maybe you had that and maybe you didn't think it was that bad
38:06
of a thing cuz you saw it as just being super loving to whoever that person was like pouring out so much love upon them.
38:14
But the enemy could have shaped your personality in this way
38:21
where it becomes unattractive to people. It makes people
38:27
push away or maybe um you know you you you you had
38:34
selfishness, you had pride but you didn't see it but the enemy fed you that. So when when people came close
38:41
they saw it because people can see selfishness. People can see pride sometimes. People can see it more than
38:47
you really can see in yourself. And so maybe the enemy like the enemy
38:53
could have influenced a person in their mind to act selfish, to act prideful,
38:58
but maybe the enemy was feeding them lies. Like you need to value yourself.
39:06
You need to value yourself. Always put yourself first. Love yourself.
39:12
Like maybe the enemy influenced you to
39:18
be selfish and you didn't even see it was a problem because you thought you
39:23
were just lack valuing yourself or something. You see?
39:30
And so um other things that can happen is maybe you are maybe you you would
39:38
have like a unique kind of personality whether you know this was totally made by God or
39:46
maybe you're very unique in a certain way but it was shaped by the devil.
39:53
In either instance, let's say you could um maybe you face rejection from that
40:00
whether because people were jealous, whether because of oppression, it gravitated towards it because the
40:06
oppression you had or people gravitated to reject or tended to reject you because of the oppression or because the
40:13
devil shaped your personality, people were like turned away. So this is another scheme of the devil.
40:20
So if a person has faced rejection for any of these reasons,
40:26
the devil can make that person prideful,
40:32
like how dare they reject me or start to tell you like it's because
40:38
you're unique in this way people reject you and you're like you maybe a person can dig their heels in and become
40:44
stubborn about the way they are. Um, and
40:50
you know, just just be offended that people reject you because of a certain uniqueness about
40:57
you, let's say. And then in your living that offense and stubbornness,
41:06
that increases pride. And if the way you are that's repelling people
41:13
was shaped by the devil now you're not open to be changed to
41:19
change to transform. That's the scheme of the devil to be um
41:25
to get you to be stubborn in how you are in your uniqueness
41:31
resistant to change. It's it's this rebelliousness
41:39
and and and sometimes people really don't want to change and so they can use their personality as an excuse. They can
41:44
use like well I'm made uniquely by God like as an excuse rather than humbling
41:50
themselves to see well actually there's certain aspects of your personality that
41:56
God wants to transform that was actually influenced by the enemy.
42:09
So um I first wanted to share that well I wanted I I shared I'm sharing now this
42:16
scheme of the devil the scheme of the devil to try to hold you back from being
42:24
totally this kingdom identity that God wants you to have and to represent him
42:30
perfectly. perfectly, rightly. Hallelujah. I actually I am so shocked at how I've
42:38
changed. I am so shocked. I'm so shocked. I'm so shocked how my personality's changed. Like I look back
42:46
at I was watching last week, as I mentioned recently, I was watching my
42:52
spiritual father, Prophet Joe Davyy, minister at the first conference that I hosted him at in 2017. And that was the
42:59
conference he prophesied that revival is now. That God has heard our prayers and God has brought revival now. But I was
43:06
watching last week day one of this two-day conference. It's on YouTube by the way. Um I will put the link in my
43:13
stories after this. So I believe it's called prophetic healing conference. Um
43:19
if you type in um yeah that it's at five
43:25
church's YouTube page. Anyways, um I was watching that and I would get up on the
43:30
stage and read scripture sometimes and just seeing myself, just like seeing
43:35
myself and even how I spoke and read scripture, I was shocked cuz you know it's not
43:42
often you like watch videos of yourself years ago. That was that was
43:50
eight years ago. And so I was watching myself speak and
43:55
read this scripture and I felt like I was looking at a different person.
44:02
And what's shocking is like this is when I was surrendered to God. That was already actually a year after receiving
44:07
the prophecy. And it was nine months before receiving the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle um and reach the
44:13
nations that prophecy. So it was a nine months before I received that prophecy which was nine years ago on this ninth
44:21
month that we're in. Hallelujah. Um, I had been surrendered to God for nine
44:28
months prior, there's nine again, nine months prior to receiving that prophecy
44:33
in September 19th, 2016. Um, I had already been surrendered to
44:39
God for nine months up to that point. Completely surrendered to God. And before that point, I was a Christian my
44:46
whole life. though I was a lukewarm Christian um through high school and college but I was a Christian my whole
44:53
life. I was surrendered for those nine months. I was I was you know I was growing so much in that first year of
44:59
being under my spiritual father as a spiritual daughter and still when I look back eight years ago
45:06
I feel like I'm looking at a different person. [Laughter]
45:12
Um, I have done I've tried to do 1
45:17
Corinthians 11:1, imitate me as I imitate Christ. I've tried to do that for my spiritual
45:22
father. I watch him as he ministers. I listen to him as he speaks both on the
45:29
pulpit as he ministers, but also personally to me, as he encourages me,
45:35
as he corrects me, as he equipss me, as he prophesies. I've tried to really look
45:43
at him like this is my example that Jesus has given me. He is a
45:50
representative of Christ. He's a better representative of Christ than me. And so
45:55
I want to really carry that in my heart in all ways. Now, I know I'm made to be
46:01
me. I'm not made to be him. I know that God will use me in unique ways, but I
46:06
don't want to miss out on any way that I'm supposed to be imitating him. I don't want to miss out on any way that
46:12
I'm supposed to be transformed to be a representative of Jesus. So, there's
46:17
things I would notice. I would notice how when he ministered, he walked with so much confidence, godly confidence,
46:24
but also so much humility. I saw that he always gave God the glory, never took
46:31
any glory for himself. I would see how he would walk in this authority that
46:38
I've never seen before. this authority over the devil. I've never seen until him um someone
46:46
get so serious with the devil like you cannot
46:53
oppress this child of God any longer. You have to go. Like I've never seen
47:00
anyone get that serious with the devil, with demons.
47:06
I'll never forget that day. Okay. I was left speechless as I saw my spiritual father um do mass deliverance, cast out
47:13
so many demons by God's power. And he just looked like he was doing the most serious thing in the world. He was 100%
47:20
there. He like he was just so focused. So
47:27
I just saw the heart of Jesus so much about just how God loves his people so
47:32
much and he will rescue his children from the enemy with all fierceness and
47:40
seriousness like a lion. Hallelujah. Um, and that that shaped me, that shaped
47:48
me, that changed me, that made me more serious in life, serious in general,
47:54
more serious about God's kingdom work, more mature,
48:01
more grown up to be more serious about this work of God. And that
48:10
translates away from ministry, not just in ministry. That translates before and
48:17
after. It translate the seriousness of the work of God.
48:23
That became more of my heart, more of my life, more of my personality.
48:30
Um, I saw him walk in this godly confidence
48:35
as this true leader prophet that God called him to be. And seeing him,
48:42
imitating him, seeing him, imitating that is one of the biggest things that changed me so much because public
48:49
speaking was my biggest fear and weakness. And I really did not see myself as a
48:55
preacher. I felt so insecure about me being a preacher, about me being a
49:03
pastor, about me being a minister, about me being a leader. I felt so insecure
49:09
about that for years and years and years, for
49:14
almost five years. I I I felt that insecurity when revival broke
49:21
out. That's when it broke off once and for all. the feelings of insecurity. But
49:29
I saw how he walked with his confidence. He knew who he was in Christ. He knew
49:35
who Jesus told him he was. And that's faith.
49:42
For you to have confidence is based on your faith.
49:48
Faith in God and what he has called you to do and who he has called you. And so
49:54
I had faith that God, that Jesus through my spiritual father called me to be an
50:01
apostle and to be a leader of a church and to preach
50:08
the gospel. I I
50:14
saw my spiritual father's example and I knew I needed to meditate on this truth
50:20
so that my faith would grow, so that my confidence could come, could grow.
50:30
That came from carefully watching my spiritual father,
50:36
seeing him walk in this godly confidence and also imitating how he spoke with
50:42
such certainty over my life, over what I was called to. And he would continually
50:48
encourage me, edify me about who I was, about the future, about what God had
50:56
called me to. And I so he's speaking with this confidence. So I'm like,
51:01
"Okay, I I'm going to I got to imitate that for for me. The way he sees me, I got to I I need to imitate how he sees
51:08
me for me to see me for for for him to say what he sees me
51:14
doing." He said he saw me doing all that I'm doing now when I was this insecure
51:20
little Christian girl trying to be a singer in my mid20s who couldn't imagine
51:26
preaching who spoke I even my voice like I looked at past testim past I looked at past
51:33
testimonies or past testimonies when I went to my spiritual father's church like for the first time I share my testimony
51:39
um what was this I don't know 20 oh 2017 this would have then is when I first
51:44
went to Tanzania, my spiritual father's church, and I heard myself testify and my voice changed.
51:53
Some of you know what I'm talking about. You've heard them my voice. I mean, you heard you've seen these videos, but like I'm testifying and I'm testifying like
52:00
as this like sweet girl and sometimes I can sense there's like, you know, like
52:10
I mean at I remember in my mid20s, my late 20s, I wanted to be married. I came from being lukewarm. And so sometimes as
52:17
as as a woman, we can like
52:22
we c it can show from the outside what we want. We if you want a man to
52:31
pursue you, okay? And this can be in a total good and godly way like you want a
52:36
husband but maybe this is maybe this is um you're thinking about it too much or
52:42
something or may you know you're not it's it shouldn't be coming out so much
52:48
when you are a child of God. We are called to represent Jesus and walk in authority and be strong and confident,
52:54
not just be this like I'm ready for my husband,
53:00
look pretty, like that's not what we're called to. And the right person, whether
53:06
you're a man or woman listening, watching, the right person, the right uh
53:12
uh the person who's called to be your wife or husband, like they they will be
53:17
attracted to who you are in Christ. They will be attracted to that to how
53:23
brightly you shine and they will see that beauty and that's going to be the
53:28
most godly, beautiful um marriage and relationship. So anyways, I look back and I I sound more
53:35
like this. Like I'm a pretty girl, but like just waiting for a husband, a
53:42
Christian, nice Christian guy. So that's kind of like and um but like I don't
53:47
talk with much authority. I I speak like more like soft and like higher.
53:57
And I'm I'm shocked when I go back and listen. I'm shocked when I go back and listen at how much I have changed. And I
54:04
I'm telling you, I never was like listening to myself. I never was like,
54:09
"Oh, I need to speak with more authority. Oh, I need to speak with um
54:16
not so like um girly girly like
54:22
that never happened. I I I I'm telling you that never happened." But just like
54:28
me making that intention to imitate my spiritual leader, my spiritual father as he imitates Christ, it brought this
54:35
change in my personality. Hallelujah. It made me more pure. It
54:44
made me more pure. And I made that intention to have my focus solely on doing the work of God.
54:51
Solely doing the work. like I I made that intention to be disciplined in my mind to stay focused to not be how I was
54:59
before. I wouldn't let my mind wander and purity came through that because
55:06
what's in the inside comes out. And so before I'm like, "Oh, I like I want a
55:14
nice Christian husband and I'm just like this sweet Christian girl, you know, not
55:21
planning to do anything like so life transforming the world like just want a
55:28
simple life." Like that came out as I look back. I'm like,
55:34
"Oh my goodness, I remember how I was." And I like see myself from the outside of who I used to be.
55:42
It's so cool to look back and see what God has done. And I didn't even like try to change these things specifically, but
55:48
it happened by humbling myself and imitating my spiritual leader as my
55:54
spiritual father as he imitated Christ. Hallelujah. Um,
56:00
also something I learned from my spiritual father so much by imitating him and this so much was by listening to his teachings but also watching his life
56:06
and seeing him seeing him in his personal life. Um,
56:12
he so he protects the anointing because the anointing is so valuable, precious,
56:18
rare and you can't live a casual life with the anointing. Um, for one,
56:27
the devil is is looking for you to be casual with the anointing because then
56:34
he can like send people to drain it. Like he can send you you start living
56:40
casual. You start like socializing, socializing, socializing so much and he
56:46
can send people to just like misuse the anointing. just drain the anointing because the
56:52
anointing is for ministry. The anointing is to preach the gospel, heal the sick,
56:59
cast out demons, do the work of God that God has called you to. And um sometimes we can do things that
57:06
are not like outright sinful, but even just like in a socializing way or just
57:12
how you spend your time, spending your time with people, but it's not in the
57:18
will of God. It's those things you aren't called to to. It's like the
57:24
anointing has to be preserved and protected so hardcore.
57:32
Um, and so you have to live a different life. Like when you're an anointed servant of God,
57:39
I'm talking about specifically like an anointed servant of God, you fivefold ministry, you have to really live a
57:45
consecrated life. And it's hard for people to understand because
57:51
this consecration looks like so much alone time, but it's for the
57:56
purpose of protecting the anointing and spending time with God and staying
58:02
focused and um just
58:07
having such protection where the devil can't find anything to
58:13
any way to drain the anointing or take the anointing away. I have to verify this on Tik Tok.
58:28
So yeah, so like as I went to Tanzania, I see my spiritual father and I see like, wow, this is so different. Like
58:36
the way he lives, the way he's consecrated, the way he protects the anointing, the way he's just lives so
58:43
differently, so differently. the sacrifice to protect the anointing.
58:49
Um, and a big a big area of that is who you bring in close.
58:55
So, um, I've imitated that. I have I have imitated that. And that's a big
59:02
secret of the anointing. Big secret is the protection of it. Is
59:08
be willing to sacrifice and not live like other people live. to be so consecrated and set apart
59:16
to protect it. Um, and and a big part of that has been who
59:25
who I bring in close. And this is what I want you all to hear now. You have to be very careful about who you bring in
59:30
close. Um because I'm telling you, people will
59:36
there will be believers out there who are lukewarm and not surrendered to God,
59:41
but they won't say they're lukewarm. They won't say they're not surrendered to God. They'll say the opposite. They'll say the opposite.
59:50
But their actions show differently. But the devil wants you to push away wisdom
59:59
and bring the wrong people in close to drain you, to drain the anointing in you
1:00:06
and to bring unnecessary um problems in your life because of the
1:00:13
open door this person has. Um,
1:00:20
and that's what I this is what I want to this is one of the big things that the
1:00:26
Holy Spirit was leading me to share today is having to do with those of you.
1:00:31
There's some of you that you
1:00:36
are very unique. But some of this uniqueness, some of the certain characteristics that
1:00:43
you have, um, parts of your personality, you have to humble yourself and give it
1:00:49
all to God. Like I gave you, I gave you this example that
1:00:55
I gave you, this example I gave you about myself. Like
1:01:00
I just simply devoted myself to the the teachings from through my spiritual
1:01:06
father. I imitated him and I made such focus on this that this this
1:01:13
transformation of my personality and how I acted, how I spoke, it came
1:01:20
it it happened. It happened automatically. And so there's some of you that need to
1:01:27
you haven't devoted yourself to this and
1:01:33
there's parts of you that need to change. And like the example I gave, the example
1:01:40
I gave, it was doing nothing that in my mind was like sinful or anything, but it
1:01:45
was a part of my personality influenced by the enemy that God wanted to change
1:01:50
completely, wanted to get rid of even and put something new.
1:01:56
Um, and if you don't do this, you will attract the wrong people. If I, you
1:02:03
know, if I didn't surrender that, surrender myself, my
1:02:10
personality, my identity, then
1:02:16
the wrong people, the wrong guys, they would like come into my life. I could be distracted by that and I could have been
1:02:23
bringing it on myself because of the way my personality was.
1:02:30
that wasn't how God wanted it to be. And so um here let me give you another
1:02:36
example. So I this is one example and I and I believe God is going to be speaking to you the example I shared of
1:02:41
myself but I believe God is going to be giving you all some of you already are hearing it revelation from God about
1:02:50
different unique aspects of your personality that God wants to transform. So um this is another example.
1:02:58
A person there's a person might have found a lot of rejection. Maybe it's
1:03:03
because of certain uniqueness that they have their personality or something. Maybe they face a lot of rejection.
1:03:08
Maybe they consider themselves a misfit, you know. And then another person,
1:03:16
let's say there's another person out there who they
1:03:22
they have this unique personality, but their unique personality was shaped by
1:03:28
the devil and they are presently being used by the devil
1:03:34
because they're not surrendered to God. So now this person has similarities to
1:03:40
you because you both found rejection because of like uniqueness
1:03:46
and what can happen is pe people like that can be gravitated towards one another. You
1:03:54
maybe you maybe people are just jealous of you but you went through a lot of rejection and now another person is
1:03:59
coming into your life. They have gone through these same things that you have and you see their uniqueness. you can see, you know, wow,
1:04:07
we're both unique. We're both rejected because of our uniqueness. But that person's uniqueness was actually shaped
1:04:12
by the devil and they're presently being used by the devil. But what can happen is a person
1:04:19
discounts all wisdom and has like
1:04:26
has like compassion for the person, but not in a good way.
1:04:33
Because we are called to love all people, but we're not called to bring all people close.
1:04:39
And a lot of people, they are walking outside of wisdom because they're bringing the wrong people in close out
1:04:45
of the name of love and compassion. Jesus only kept three people very close.
1:04:54
And then there was 12 that were close, semi-lo. These three that I'm talking about,
1:04:59
James, John, and Peter, they're with him in the mount of transfiguration and in the garden of Gethsemane,
1:05:05
those would have been the most spiritual, the ones that Jesus couldn't could trust the most that had no open doors to the devil at that present time,
1:05:12
at least because they weren't no, they weren't perfect at that time, but they had the
1:05:17
least amount of doors open to the enemy. They were they were surrendered the most to God. Now, you have the 12 disciples.
1:05:24
They're semi close and we can see biblically that they were loving Jesus,
1:05:30
following Jesus the most spiritual, the most that the most safe spiritually to be close to Jesus.
1:05:39
But it's only those 12 and then three that he even brought really close.
1:05:45
And they weren't random people. They weren't just some random person off of the street. It was it wasn't just some
1:05:50
person that forced himself on them because there'll be people like that that will just latch on to you.
1:05:58
And it's the devil like the devil's using them as a as an open door, using
1:06:04
them to drain you when you weren't called to bring that person in close. We are called to love everybody. Jesus
1:06:10
loved everybody, but he didn't bring everyone in close. He ministered to them
1:06:16
all. Through your life, through your social media, you shine your light. That's how you love everybody. You pray
1:06:23
for them. That's how you love everybody. If you have interactions with them ever,
1:06:28
you see them in real life. You love them, but you don't pull them in really close, but you love them. You speak
1:06:34
kindly to them. You were you were you were generous to them. You were loving
1:06:40
to them with your face, with how you speak, with how you act, but you don't bring them in really close.
1:06:48
When Jesus ministered to people, he didn't come invite them to to stay with him
1:06:56
where he sleeped. He ministered to them and then he left.
1:07:02
That's how he was called to love them. And so um there's this scheme of the
1:07:08
devil for you know people with maybe a similar
1:07:15
personality. They've gone through rejection because of uniqueness in your personality and you'll you'll feel you
1:07:23
want to bring them in close. But this is an open door to the enemy
1:07:28
when that person is being used by the enemy. they have open doors when they're not surrendered
1:07:34
to God. And so it's so important this teaching to open up your eyes to see that um
1:07:41
first to look within yourself so that you can change and be the most
1:07:48
Christlike. Nothing holding you back.
1:07:53
Nothing holding you back. And also so you can have this wisdom
1:08:00
to not bring the wrong people in close.
1:08:05
Um I want to end with this story.
1:08:11
One of my spiritual daughters, I believe she's going to share this testimony, but I want to tell like the story first
1:08:17
right now um with you. I'll share it with you. So she um
1:08:24
she was in a romantic relationship with a guy um
1:08:33
and she had this precious heart has this precious heart and had this precious heart for Jesus and she came to Fivefold
1:08:41
Church. She came to the church and um I I was talking with her and she was
1:08:47
telling me about the situation, this relationship she's in. And as she's describing this relationship, as she's
1:08:54
describing this person, I can just see this is 100% not the person she's
1:09:00
supposed to be with because very very they're very very very very unequally
1:09:07
yolked. Um me myself, I had so much value for
1:09:13
myself. Um well, I thought I did actually. Well, no, I did at that point because that was
1:09:20
one of the prophetic words that my spiritual father gave me actually when I received the prophecy of my life is that you need to value yourself more to get
1:09:27
to this calling that God has called you to um raise your
1:09:32
standard. So, but before that was said, I already thought I had a high standard
1:09:39
because my dad just treated my mom amazingly. They have they're in love. It is so beautiful their marriage and they
1:09:46
love Jesus so much. My parents, they're humble, pure, and but my dad is is an
1:09:51
amazing Christian man, godly man. And um
1:09:57
I mean, he is really an amazing godly man. and um
1:10:03
and he acts godly and he treats my mom in a godly manner.
1:10:08
Um and I that was my example growing up. And so
1:10:14
I just knew that's my standard like how my dad is,
1:10:19
how my dad treats my wife, how my treats treats his wife, my mom, how my dad acts
1:10:25
godly is godly. Like that is my standard. like not going any lower than
1:10:30
that. Like I I I just knew that I knew that I knew that's my standard. Um
1:10:37
it didn't it of course in lukewarm times it diverted away from that but like in my heart from there and then coming back
1:10:44
it was there in my heart. Um and so I'm seeing her as I see myself. I'm seeing
1:10:51
her my spiritual daughter as this like amazing godly woman. and I'm seeing that
1:10:58
she doesn't see her value uh with this relationship she's in. And um she's
1:11:03
sharing about it with me and I'm just like looking at her with kind of a blank
1:11:09
face. Like I'm not like um oh that's awesome that you're in this relationship
1:11:14
with that guy. That's awesome. No, I was just kind of like just listening. And she tells me now, she's like, "I could
1:11:22
tell by your face. It said it all."
1:11:27
And it really spoke to her. And um I was just being like real. I wasn't, you
1:11:33
know, I was just cuz everyone has free will. I It wasn't the calling to be like, "You need to break up with this
1:11:39
guy." No, I wasn't the leading of the Holy Spirit to do that in that moment, you know, but she was imitating me in
1:11:46
that moment. She was seeing she was seen um in the spirit. She was seeing me
1:11:52
spiritually in a respectful manner like imitating me, you know. And so long
1:11:59
story short, the holy God ends up leading her to end that relationship. And um she she says now she says like I
1:12:08
realized that I saw the beauty in him but it made me dis look away from all
1:12:15
the other things. And so that's a beautiful thing that God's put in me. Beautiful thing. But
1:12:22
you have to walk in wisdom. You have to walk in wisdom with relationships with
1:12:29
um romantic relationships because sometimes when we want something
1:12:35
but oh darn it they don't have whether it's a close friend or whether it's a romantic relationship you're like I want
1:12:41
this friendship or I want this uh boyfriend or girlfriend. Um but but it's
1:12:47
not God's will and the reason being is unequally yolked. But if you want it, many times
1:12:55
you'll see the beauty real easily and you'll just push away the red flags,
1:13:02
push away the unequally yolked signs
1:13:07
because you want it. So you got to be aware of that scheme of the devil/ scheme of the flesh.
1:13:14
the way we can be, the way people can be, believers can be when they want
1:13:20
things so much when it comes to relationships. This could be because you feel lonely, you really want a close
1:13:26
friend. You have to be aware. Walk in this wisdom.
1:13:32
Amen. Hallelujah.
1:13:39
Hallelujah. Well, thank you, Lord. I know that spiritual eyes, your spiritual
1:13:45
eyes have opened up so much and you have just increased in wisdom massively.
1:13:50
Thank you, Jesus. And I believe that that the devil's schemes are destroyed off of your life today. And I want to
Prayer
1:13:57
pray for you right now. I want to encourage you all right now to spend a
1:14:03
moment and just take a a moment with the Holy Spirit right now and just look at
1:14:10
your personality. Look at the way you speak, the way you are. Just
1:14:16
everything. Look at your past. Look at your your how you your identity right
1:14:22
now. Look at the past. Is there certain areas the enemy came in and it changed
1:14:28
me? but not not not for good. Look at all of these things and surrender it all
1:14:37
to God. Surrender this. Maybe it's an identity that you're holding on to, an aspect of your identity, an aspect of
1:14:44
your personality. Surrender it to God.
1:14:49
Um, renounce renounce these these areas
1:14:56
you've gone wrong in when it came to relationships. Renounce these um wrong covenants you
1:15:04
have made. You might have made you got to be aware of this. The enemy can bring the wrong people in your life sometimes
1:15:11
and that the enemy may you may feel a prompting to make a covenant with that
1:15:17
person like you'll never leave them, you'll be your the best friend forever
1:15:22
or etc. You got some of you need to really reflect on
1:15:29
certain covenants you've made that was led by the enemy to try to keep you stuck and not moving forward bound with
1:15:37
this soul tie to a person. So just right now spend this time and
1:15:44
start speaking these things. Start renouncing these things. And I I encourage you right now to just
1:15:49
surrender everything to Jesus. every part of your personality, just say, "Lord, just just tell them with your own
1:15:56
words. Whatever way you want to transform my personality,
1:16:01
whatever way you whatever anything you want to take away, I give it to you,
1:16:06
Lord. Have your way with me. Have your way. Every single part of my life, how I speak, the tone of my voice, the tone of
1:16:14
my voice changed. And I didn't mean to, but I surrendered to God. And the tone
1:16:19
of my voice change like change like surrender every part of yourself to God
1:16:27
right now. Thank you Jesus.
1:16:32
Thank you Lord. Thank you God.
1:16:40
And I encourage you also to renounce word curses people spoke over you and that you spoke over yourself. negative
1:16:46
words about your identity and maybe you didn't consider them negative. You're just like, "Yeah, this is who I am."
1:16:54
The shy one, the introverted one, the loud one, the brash one, the comedian,
1:17:03
the class clown, the perfectionist.
1:17:09
Humor is beautiful, but you don't want that to be your identity. Number one,
1:17:16
excellence for the kingdom is beautiful, but you don't want it you perfectionism
1:17:21
in an OCD way to be your identity. Number one. Amen. So, just any of these words that
1:17:29
you've spoken over yourself. Oh, yeah. I am a Yeah, even saying I'm a perfectionist.
1:17:35
Things like this can lead you from being um flexible with the Holy Spirit. Can cause you to be rigid.
1:17:43
can cause you to have so much condemnation when you aren't perfect. Like these titles, these words you
1:17:48
spoken over yourself to describe yourself to people or people spoke over yourself or maybe you had the senior superlative in in uh high school.
1:17:57
Renounce these things. Thank you, Jesus.
1:18:05
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Right now,
1:18:12
I detach you from all these things you've renounced. I break every word curse spoken over
1:18:19
you. And these word curses that shaped your identity that you didn't even see
1:18:25
as bad, but they shaped your identity, not in a godly way. I speak these word
1:18:33
words to be taken off of you. All of these identities that are not
1:18:39
your kingdom identity, kingdom of God identity, child of God identity, I speak them to be wiped away in Jesus' name.
1:18:48
Thank you, Lord. And I declare right now that
1:18:54
all spirits of rejection must go in Jesus' name.
1:19:01
I declare that all of the trauma that came from mistreatment, abuse,
1:19:08
from rejection, it must go now in Jesus name.
1:19:14
All of this trauma and oppression
1:19:20
that came, this loneliness, this depression, this fear of being left alone that came from people leaving you,
1:19:28
rejecting you for the same reasons many times. This must go now in Jesus' name.
1:19:38
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
1:19:44
Thank you, Jesus. I declare all the heaviness that you've carried from times you were rejected,
1:19:52
from times you were betrayed, from times people made fun of you.
1:19:58
This heaviness must be lifted off now in Jesus name. I declare all depression must go. All
1:20:07
death must go. Anxiety, fears must go.
1:20:12
I speak all addictions must go in Jesus name. I speak all sicknesses must go in
1:20:18
Jesus name. Thank you Jesus.
1:20:24
Thank you Lord. And I see God delivering a lot of women right now.
1:20:32
A lot of women. I see God delivering a lot of women from
1:20:40
this fear of not finding the right person.
1:20:47
This fear of I see God delivering a lot of women of from this fear that you will
1:20:54
never be liked. You will not be good enough by
1:21:01
people with a high stand by men in a high standard that you that you wouldn't
1:21:08
be good enough that you wouldn't be lovable. This fear must go in Jesus' name.
1:21:18
And I see a lot of women. I see some men too. But there's I
1:21:25
see a lot of scars on the heart, hurt from romantic relationships where
1:21:33
people left you. People just said, "I don't want to be with you anymore."
1:21:41
This just kept happening and happening. I speak all of the sadness, all of the
1:21:47
heaviness, all of the fear of that happening again must go in Jesus' name.
1:21:53
And God is saying right now that he was preserving you. He was protecting you.
1:21:59
These were not the right people. And this happened for this reason.
1:22:06
I'm a testament to that in my life that God actually I went through that. And
1:22:12
God allowed all of that to happen as hurtful as it was to protect me.
1:22:20
that rejection was my protection. And I want to say to you that felt
1:22:28
because you kept getting rejected. You kept being left. You just kept feeling like it must be
1:22:34
me. I'm not good enough. I'm not lovable enough. I'm not beautiful enough. I'm
1:22:40
not funny enough. I'm not smart enough. There's my personality isn't charming
1:22:45
enough. The devil's a liar. And I I say to you that you are made perfectly. You
1:22:51
are made beautifully and you are more than enough. You are more than enough.
1:22:56
May all that insecurity leave now in Jesus' name. Thank you Jesus.
1:23:03
Thank you Jesus. You are so precious. You are so valuable. You are so beautifully made.
1:23:12
You are lovable. You are more than enough.
1:23:18
With Jesus living inside of you, you are way more than enough.
1:23:24
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. I speak all of that
1:23:30
insecurity of every in every area to go now in Jesus name. Everything that held you back from standing strong and tall
1:23:37
and proud to be who God called you to be.
1:23:43
Proud to be a child of God. May that strength come in you, that
1:23:48
courage, that confidence come in you now in Jesus name.
1:23:54
Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. And I release this anointing over you
1:24:00
all now. And I speak transformation to come. Great transformation to come.
1:24:08
Everything of your identity that the enemy's tried to put on you, stick on you,
1:24:14
keep you in as you are a new creation, it must be exposed and fall away now in
1:24:20
Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord.
1:24:27
Thank you Jesus. I speak God's kingdom identity over you now. You are a child
1:24:33
of God. Child a child of the King of Kings. You are royalty. You are valuable. You are precious. You are
1:24:40
perfectly made. You are beloved.
1:24:47
And God has such great plans for you. You are a servant in God's kingdom. You
1:24:52
are a disciple. You are one who learns every day. You are childlike. You are
1:24:57
humble. You are pure. You are patient. You are kind.
1:25:03
You are full of faith. You are gentle. You have self-control.
1:25:10
I speak this identity over you. May you be molded to have all of these
1:25:16
qualities, all these characteristics, this personality of Jesus in Jesus name. May you walk in authority
1:25:24
over the devil. You are a victor and you are a lion and lioness
1:25:30
who walks in authority and stomps on the devil
1:25:35
every day. You're a vessel of God who brings light,
1:25:41
his light, his love, his power to the world. You are ch you're a world changer
1:25:48
and you are a blessing to all those you encounter. You plant seeds
1:25:55

1:26:02
world is more bright because of you. And the world will become brighter because of you. Every day you're on this earth.
1:26:11
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God is proud of you. He
1:26:17
loves you so much. Just breathe in deeply
1:26:27
to receive this truth over you.
1:26:35
Accept your identity. Accept your new identity in Christ.
1:26:41
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
1:26:47
Thank you, God. I believe that you are changed from today and you will be a completely different person from now and
1:26:56
this change will keep happening every day. I encourage you to do what I did.
1:27:01
Imitate me as I imitate Christ. I encourage you to do that. I encourage you to to clo pay close attention.
1:27:08
Pay close attention. Like it's not just imitating in like preach
1:27:16
the gospel, heal the sick, cast out demons, and be loving to people. But how
1:27:23
how to be loving to to somebody? If you see me being loving to someone, how am I
1:27:28
being loving to someone? If you see me being patient to someone, how am I being patient to someone? If you see me having
1:27:35
self-control, how what's the way that I'm doing that, you know?
1:27:40
It's looking carefully like as I shared I looked carefully at my spiritual father and this change came change my
1:27:48
personality came change in these aspects of my personality my voice
1:27:55
came. So I encourage you to really take this more seriously.
1:28:05
It is seen. It is seen when you look like your spiritual leader. It is seen when you're
1:28:12
not. It can really be seen. And when sometimes when we're not
1:28:19
wanting to imitate so much and we're wanting to hold on so much of that
1:28:25
personality, that's actually not godly. It's rebellious. It's a form of
1:28:30
rebelliousness. So, it can cause you to be rebellious in other areas.
1:28:36
It's seen. So, I encourage you to really take this to heart. Take this to heart
1:28:43
that God wants to transform you in ways you didn't imagine
1:28:49
to be the best representative of Jesus possible.
1:28:54
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. For all of you who came with prayer requests today, for all of you who have
1:29:01

name. May you be filled with abundant joy, abundant peace now in the name of
1:31:42
Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. One other thing I I imitated
1:31:49
I noticed of my spiritual father is that as serious as he is when he ministers,
1:31:54
there's a time when he ministers and outside of ministry too for laughter,
1:32:01
for just joy in the Lord and just dancing before God and just wildly
1:32:09
praising God, wildly dancing before God,
1:32:14
singing before God with all of your heart with no abandon. Is that the
1:32:19
saying? Yeah. I've seen the childlikeess in him,
1:32:26
the joy, how there's a time and place for that beautiful
1:32:32
part of Jesus to come out. Hallelujah. Praise God. So may you go in joy, great
1:32:40
joy and rejoicing, great joy in the Lord, great peace in the Lord in Jesus name.
1:32:48
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Wow. This has been so
1:32:53
amazing what Jesus has done. Thank you Jesus. I I know he has just done so many miracles. Thank you Jesus. I encourage
1:33:00
you to thank God right now for what he has just done. and thank him for the miracles he has done because this is how
1:33:07
you receive. He's just released so much. And it's so important you buy faith. You
1:33:13
grab them. You value them. You don't discount them. You don't just leave them
1:33:19
here, but you grab them with faith. You say, "I receive. Thank you, Jesus, for
1:33:24
doing this miracle." Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:33:30
Some of you are going to see these miracles manifest later. This is how many times God moves is where you don't
1:33:36
feel anything different right away, but the miracle has happened in the spiritual realm and it will manifest as
1:33:41
time goes on. Like the lepers who came to Jesus and they were healed after they left Jesus's presence. I want to invite
Announcements
1:33:48
you all right now to give to the work of God at Five-fold Church. I'm the pastor at Fivefold Church. And I want to invite
1:33:55
you to sew into God's kingdom to help advance God's kingdom so we can do more
1:34:00
of the work of God and reach more and more people. Plan more events where God is glorified, his power is released and
1:34:07
believers are equipped and set on fire. Glory to God. I want to also encourage
1:34:13
you that whenever you give, there is a reaping that takes place. God sees every seed you sew and he brings blessing. He
1:34:20
brings reaping. He brings harvest upon the seeds. So when God calls us to be
1:34:26
cheerful givers, it shouldn't be that hard. It shouldn't be it should be
1:34:32
really easy if you can see in the spirit to be a cheerful giver, to give with expectancy, with excitement, with joy to
1:34:39
touch God's heart in this way because this act of obedience truly touches
1:34:44
God's heart. You're giving what's important to you. You are surrendering everything to Jesus
1:34:50
including money which has a hold on a lot of people and it will have a hold if you don't surrender that and you are
1:34:57
contributing to God's kingdom. So it translates to more lives being touched, saved, healed and delivered because you
1:35:04
gave. Amen. So if you'd like to give, you can go to the link in my bio or fivefurch.org/give.
1:35:11
I want to pray over you all right now. All of you who are giving, I release more of this anointing upon
1:35:18
all of you giving right now in Jesus' name.
1:35:24
May everything that was trying to hold you back from advancing, from moving forward, from moving forward financially
1:35:30
and for moving forward in your career, from moving forward in your dream and what God has called you to do. This must
1:35:37
go. All the stagnancy must go. All the lack, poverty, it must go in Jesus'
1:35:44
name. May you move forward. May you be propelled ahead now in Jesus' name. May you move forward every day. May you grow
1:35:52
every day from spiritual to physical. Grow financially every day in Jesus
1:35:57
name. Let there be increase in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:36:05

1:44:19
future one. The next one will be next week. All right. Well, thank you, Jesus. Oh,
1:44:26
one last thing is if you are new here, listen up. There are many scammers and impersonators of me. So, please be aware
1:44:33
of that. Um, only if you if you want to donate to my
1:44:39
ministry, just go to fivefchurch.org/give or the link in my bio to that website.
1:44:45
That's the only way to give. So, don't be sending money other places. Um,
1:44:53
like there's a lot of scammers that say they they DM they pretend to be me. They
1:44:58
DM people with a prophetic message saying you need to give to this orphanage to be free from the enemy's
1:45:05
attacks or something like that. So, that's a scammer. That's not me. Don't do that. Um, I mean, don't give to the
1:45:12
scammers. Don't be fooled by the scammers. Okay. Um, the big the easiest way to know that it's my true accounts
1:45:20
on social media is that on all social media accounts except for X except for X,
1:45:27
I have more more than 200,000 followers or subscribers. On most of them, it's
1:45:33
way more than 200,000, but all of the scammers will have way less than that. So, that's that's the
1:45:40
easiest way to know. On X, my name is Katherine Crick. Katherine Crick. Um, I
1:45:47
don't have any Facebook groups, like Facebook prayer request groups. That's I don't have any of those. Those are all
1:45:53
impersonators. I just have my page. Um, and
1:45:59
what else? Uh, oh, I will never um DM you. I will never FaceTime with you. I
1:46:06
will never reply to your comments on my posts saying I want to talk to you more
1:46:11
here or wanting to communicate with you personally in a different way like through email or something like that.
1:46:18
The scammers do this is why I share that. Um I don't have a Gmail, a
1:46:23
WhatsApp or a Telegram and I don't do video calls, FaceTime
1:46:29
calls. And also please be aware of AI audio messages. I will not be sending
1:46:34
you audio messages. So, if there's an audio message that you get that sounds like me, it's not me, it's AI. All
1:46:41
right? So, just be aware of all that and um let your friends and family know if
1:46:46
you share my ministry with them so they're not scammed. But I speak protection over everyone and that you
1:46:53
would walk in great wisdom in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Just want to share that so you know what my account
1:47:00
is. Hallelujah. All right. Well, I am so excited for
1:47:05
church on Sunday at Fivefold Church. God is going to move powerfully. It's truly
1:47:10
revival every Sunday. So, I encourage you, do not miss it. If you're in the LA area, do not miss it. People travel from
1:47:16
all over the world and have been since 2021 every single Sunday to be in the
1:47:22
presence of revival in where the power of God is moving to encounter his power. So,
1:47:28
come do not miss this. And all of you online that can't be there in person, get ready to encounter Jesus through the
1:47:35
screen so powerfully. Amen. All right, I encourage you to share this live stream. I know that this
1:47:41
live stream is so needed for so many people out there that didn't see this today. So, I encourage you to share it.
1:47:46
I encourage you to bookmark this one as well. This is an important one. And I bless all of you. Have an amazing rest
1:47:53
of your day or night. And we'll see you on Sunday. God bless you all.
