Apostle Katherine's book has been groundbreaking in my life to share with

36:58
what I need to know about unlocking my own deliverance, which has been done. Hallelujah. And helping others receive
37:05
their deliverance. Apostle Katherine's book, it came out in April, but it is still selling, selling, and like a

fellowship, and be part of 5Furch, but also be part of a small group community.
38:55
Amen. You can go to 5fchurch.org/sallgroups and find the small group that's closest
39:01
to you. Amen. We have small groups even in California that are people from Northern California, people from down by
39:08
San Diego. Those are people who can't get to 5F in LA every Sunday. We have
39:13
many, many small groups all over the United States. We have small groups in other countries. We can't even name them
39:20
all right now. But if you will go to 5fchurch.org/s smallgroups, find the one that's closest
39:26
to you and join that small group and God will touch your life so powerfully. You
39:32
are see we're seeing miracles in these small groups. Glory, healing, miracles, deliverance,
39:37
freedom. Hallelujah. We also have a small group that's a Spanish-sp speakaking small group. And if you're in
39:44
the United States, you may join that group. If you speak French, but you don't live in France, you can join the
39:51
French small group. Amen. God is just moving so mightily. These small groups
39:57
are bursting over the whole globe. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. And we
40:04
also um it's like I said, if you don't have a small group in your area or state right now or region, join the one that
40:11
is closest to you and you will be so blessed and grow so much. Amen. Thank
40:17
you, Jesus. And we also want you to know we still have 5F church flyers available
40:24
in the lobby. These flyers are being handed out everywhere. People are
40:29
grabbing 10, 20, 15, taking them and passing them out on the streets, passing them out in your city. You may live two
40:36
hours away. Pass them out in your city. Leave them on the bus. Leave them at work. Leave them in the restroom. Leave
40:42
them at a restaurant. Hand them to people. It is amazing way to just share Jesus in the end time revival. There's a
40:49
QR code on there because we know people can be planted online at 5Furch from
40:54
anywhere in the planet. Amen. So grab a couple on your way out and as you hand
41:00

51:24
or 5fchurch.org/events. Amen. Now, for those of you in the
51:31
Philippines, I have something to announce announce. La last year, I ministered at Revi in in
51:40
the Philippines. It was called Revival is now Philippines and it was so might
51:45
such a mighty move of God where 8,000 people came and it was mass deliverance
51:51
like we had never seen. You know, so many people have testified that as they watch replays, as they watch past
51:57
videos, they get delivered. They get healed. They encounter God's power so mightily.
52:04
Is that anybody here? Is that anybody here? We don't have to play this yet before I announce it. Is that anybody
52:10
here? Anybody got anybody received watching online past replays? I know
52:16
there's more of you. I don't think you heard me because I've seen so many testimonies. If you've ever received a miracle while watching a
52:23
video that was not live, but it was a replay at 5F Church or any revival events, raise your hand. And in the
52:29
comments, write that's me. Is a lot of hands. It's like pretty much most of the people here. Hallelujah. So, I say all
52:36
of that to say is that our 5F church small group in the Philippines had this
52:42
amazing creative idea to reach the people in the
52:48
Philippines to spread this revival. They had this idea to show a replay of that
52:54
event at a movie theater. We can show it now.
53:02
So, this is this is showing the replay of that event. They rented out a movie
53:07
theater, a big movie theater that can hold a lot of people. There they are. There's some of our small group leaders
53:15
in the Philippines. Hallelujah.
53:20
And this is outside the This is the movie theater. It's so Look at It's so powerful
53:26
in the mall. Isn't that amazing?
53:31
Hallelujah. You see, look, look at the other movies they're advertising. And revival is now.
53:38
Glory to God. September 20th, 9:00 a.m. September
53:46
20th, 900 a.m. Free admission. This is a powerful way to shine your
53:52
light. Shining the light in the darkness. Wow. So, all of you in the Philippines, um, I encourage you to go
53:58
to this. And this is also going to be a gathering of the Philippines small group. This is our first time meeting in
54:04
person. They've been meeting virtually. There's so many of them. So, it's going to be so powerful. And um you got to you
54:12
those of you those of you 5F church small group members uh in the Philippines, small group leaders and
54:18
members, you got to take the camera out and show us what happens cuz I am believing that movie theater to break
54:25
out in mass deliverance and healing and miracles. Hallelujah.
54:32
And I speak that, you know, the Philippines was the first place that the promise came to pass that this revival
54:38
would grow to stadiums, to arenas where 8,000 filled the arena. And that that's
54:45
the beginning. That's the beginning. That's the It's like the There's a scripture where there's a story in the
54:52
Bible where Elisha says, "I see rain coming." And he sends his servant to go
54:57
look for the rain. And he says, "There's a cloud the size of the palm of the hand." And so this it that was an
55:03
indicator, a small indicator that it was about to pour. Amen. And so in
55:09
Philippines that that arena event that was that and there's going to be a rain of God expanding his revival to more
55:15
stadiums and arenas. And I see through this movie theater, it's the same thing. It's going to
55:22
expand. I I know in God will you God will bring mass deliverance and healing to many many theaters around the world
55:29
in this way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Glory to God.
55:36
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, um it's free admission. So,
55:42
September 20, what does it say? September 20th. Is that what it is? Yes. Which is around the anniversary week of
55:49
when we had Revival Now Philippines. Glory to God. And also when I actually first saw my spiritual father, prophet
55:54
Jordan minister and when I received the prophecy was this week. Hallelujah. The
56:00
prophecy for my life that I was called to be an apostle. Special week. Glory to God. Nine years ago. Nine years ago this
56:06
week. Um so and now I have a couple and now I have actually one more very
56:12
exciting announcement. Very excited to share this with all of you. And for those of you watching the Lord, there
56:19
has been so much hunger in a certain nation.
56:25
For a while, such a a wild hunger, specifically this past year, pretty much
56:31
end of 2024, specifically this one nation, there has been such hunger for
56:37
Jesus, for his power, for revival. And God moves upon the hunger. God answers
56:44
the cries of the hungry. When you humbly yourself and pray, meaning you're hungry
56:50
for God's will to be done, not your own, then God will heal your land. Then God
56:56
will heal your land. And so God has led us to move just quickly and even book a
57:03
venue and everything even before raising funds because of this hunger and with faith. And so I have a new revival is
57:09
now event that 5ft church is hosting to announce and this is going to be happening in in the first week of
57:16
January. It is revival is now sow Brazil.
57:22

57:41
you Jesus. You're one you some of you may you're here for the first time. You're probably wondering why everyone's so excited here. These are our our our
57:48
five family here. Many people who are standing or those who serve those who have been here have seen the hunger. We
57:54
have seen the hunger. the social media page like of Apostle Kathern Crick in Portuguese exploded to like zero to a
58:03
100,000 followers in just like a couple months or something like that. I forget the exact statistics, but just wild
58:09
hunger there has been in Brazil specifically recently this year. Hallelujah. So, praise God. Praise God.
58:19
Um, this is going to be a free event. You can register now. link in my bio or
58:25

58:38

58:46
of the hunger. You know how God moves upon the hunger. It's something different. It's something higher. Hallelujah. When there's great hunger.
58:53

1:00:08
people when they came in. We have a we have a testimony team table. Like
1:00:13

1:00:20
to an event or something or being here, um share in the lobby. We have a sign.
1:00:26
Do you have a testimony? Um, and so some of you have done that today and I've heard just the summary of it and I'm I'm
1:00:32
so in awe of Jesus and I want you to come up and share your testimonies. All right. So, thank you for sharing them.
Testimonies
1:00:38
Um, we have first of all Natalia and Ricardo from Brazil. Can you come
1:00:52
from Brazil? This is so prophetic. Are you excited?
1:00:57
Yes. Hallelujah.
1:01:04
Brazil. Yes. Hallelujah. So prophetic that you are here.
1:01:09
Wow. So I hear you have an amazing testimony to share. Yes, we have.
1:01:14
Uh two months ago, uh I was watching you um a live on Instagram
1:01:22
and um uh we have trying to to have a baby to be pregnant for more than five
1:01:29
years and I just started to watching and you
1:01:36
said, "I see someone with troubles to to conceiving."
1:01:42
And I I knew that was to me and I received that. So yesterday
1:01:49
uh we noted that I'm pregnant just
1:01:54
just one day before I came here. I came late just to be here today. So one day
1:02:02
before I came here, I I realized that you decided to take a test like
1:02:07
yesterday. Yes. Yesterday. So we we had another one today.
1:02:14
Yes. Yes. And I'm pregnant now. Hallelujah.
1:02:23
Hallelujah. Praise God. God is so good. God is so faithful.
1:02:32
And uh we no one doctor could um couldn't find any problem with us. Uh we
1:02:41
we spent more than four years um uh in
1:02:47
searching what was happening with us but nothing. So I'm I I started to think
1:02:54
it's a spiritual. I need a miracle. It it it's not going to happen. Just a
1:02:59
miracle. So it's happened now. Yeah. Praise God.
1:03:06
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. I see so many people around the
1:03:12
world right now who are in the same situation. And I see them just crying, just so so
1:03:21
grieved that they haven't been able to conceive. And I see right now your testimony has just lifted faith in them.
1:03:27
And they will receive right now. they will receive this miracle today.
1:03:32
And I want to speak to everyone watching right now who has been having trouble conceiving. I send this anointing to you
1:03:40
now. I speak healing to you. Every spirit of infertility must go and you must conceive now in Jesus name. Amen.
1:03:50
Amen. Praise God. I'm so happy for you. We're so happy for you. We're
1:03:55
celebrating with you. Thank you, Jesus. And how far are you from Sa Paulo?
1:04:01
How far are you? 150 kilometers. Not too far. Two hours.
1:04:08
Well, I see that it is very prophetic
1:04:13
you being here today. Even I've seen there's a prophetic meaning even of the this pregnancy
1:04:21
because I see God birthing revival in Brazil.
1:04:28
In this season right now in January, it will be birthed
1:04:34
like the revival will be birthed and people crying out hungry for so long and
1:04:40
it not happening. It will be birthed. So there this is not a coincidence of
1:04:45
you coming here on the announcement and announcing that after so long of trying, God has done this miracle and you have
1:04:51
conceived. Praise God. And I see God using your testimony and using your your
1:04:58
heart for Jesus and his revival to make this revival to spread and to prepare hearts to be like John the Baptist and
1:05:05
prepare people to receive what's coming. I see God is is sending you out to do
1:05:10
this. And so I see him releasing anointing upon you. That this is one of the big reasons God brought you here was
1:05:18
to release this anointing upon you to prepare the way in Brazil for Jesus to
1:05:24
come in power. Hallelujah. I release this anointing to you now. And I speak
1:05:30
the fire for revival. The fire for Jesus to grow in you and flow out of you. And
1:05:36
may you prepare these grounds. May people's eyes open up and come and receive. I speak blessing over your
1:05:44
pregnancy and protection over the pregnancy and baby in Jesus' name. That baby would be perfectly healthy and
1:05:52
birth would the birth would be perfectly safe and healthy in Jesus' name. I
1:05:57
release this anointing upon you now. May the fire of the Holy Spirit move through you and prepare people to receive Jesus
1:06:04
in his revival. Let this revival spread through you both. Amen. Amen.
1:06:11
Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:06:16
Claudia. Claudia.
1:06:34
Hi. Pray to God Apostle Katherine.
1:06:40
The apostles in the book of Acts planted a seat at the feet of the apos. Sorry
1:06:47
people in the in the planted a seat at the feet of the apostles. I'm very
1:06:53
nervous. I'm planting this seat at your feet. Apostle I waited for deliverance
1:06:59
for years. I am 44 now. and you are the chosen vessel that
1:07:07
God used to deliver me.
1:07:12
My heart is jumping out of my chest.
1:07:18
Um, I have to lift my voice in thanksgiving
1:07:25
for Jesus Christ has done what no one else could have done for me. He has stepped in with power and mercy
1:07:33
and it's not random that I am here at Fifold Church. He knows that I have
1:07:38
looked for deliverance everywhere under the rocks and every time I wonder why I'm not receiving if I am receiving in
1:07:46
faith. But when I came here, God moved mightily
1:07:52
and to give a before and after. I used to
1:07:57
have um nightmares since the time I was four years old. Um these dark encounters used
1:08:05
to leave me drained and physically ill, especially after the Lord found me. The
1:08:12
adversary went hard after me. Um
1:08:17
PMS, I endured debilitating PMS month after month since I was 15 years old. I
1:08:22
used to think that it was a curse because I used to get sick, very sick. It was very painful. From one week to
1:08:28
two weeks, I was sick. And now my cycle is calm. I am well in Jesus' name. I
1:08:37
also used to have fear and I used to have dairy and gluten intolerance.
1:08:45
Um, after deliverance, my life shifted dramatically.
1:08:51
Now I can eat and drink anything for the glory of God. Yes.
1:08:58
Um, my cycle is calm. It's a miracle every month. I can't just believe what that
1:09:05
what God has done. Um, my dreams
1:09:11
are clean. The the spiritual warfare has decreased considerably.
1:09:17
Um, I have this joy and fire for God, this
1:09:23
longing to follow him in his footsteps and to tell
1:09:29
everyone that the Lord can set you free because I didn't know about deliverance
1:09:35
and I want to tell the world that deliverance is happening here that by his stripes we are healed. I have
1:09:41
received a personal revelations of his love for me. Um
1:09:46
I think I'm forgetting many many things but I want to tell you something. There is power in testifying on August 20th. I
1:09:55
reached out to mission tal and five of church and to you and I have shared an
1:10:00
updated testimony that everything that I have testified back in March has continued to bear fruit for the glory of
1:10:07
God. And Apostle Katherine, I believe in my heart you prayed for me because on
1:10:13
August 24th, four days after, if you allow me to read this, the Lord gave me
1:10:18
a dream at 5F. In his presence, I renowned the spirit of molestation. And then without awareness, unbeknownst to
1:10:25
me, I renounce the strong man. And I say, who am I, Lord, that you are going to reveal
1:10:32
the strong man to me? Because my family and I, we were under a spiritual attack and we were receiving blows from
1:10:37
everywhere and we wouldn't know what was hitting us. So we were renouncing everything in our bloodlines. But I
1:10:43
could have never come up with this name. The the Lord revealed Jezebel for my
1:10:48
bloodline and a wave of weakness hit me in the dream. So this dream is proof of
1:10:54
his mercy and faithfulness. Just as Daniel 2:22 says, he reveals deep and
1:10:59
secret things. He knows what is in the darkness and light dwells with him. Jesus Christ is the light of the world
1:11:05
and he has overcome the darkness and the darkness cannot comprehend it. So father go I I planted this testimony and this
1:11:13
seat at your feet apostle because this was written in the Bible is how people leaded at the feet of the apostle
1:11:19
apostle and God has raised you in in front of the church and your apostolic
1:11:25
mantle. I renounce the spirit of Jezebel for the glory of God. In Jesus name.
1:11:31
Amen. I speak this Jezebel to leave you and this fam the family in Jesus name. I
1:11:38
bless you. I bless you. May you increase in this anointing in Jesus' name for the
1:11:44
glory of God. May many people come to Jesus through you in Jesus name.
1:11:52
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I bless you. Praise God. Praise God. Glory to God.
1:12:02
Um, Lupe, if I'm saying it right. Loop or Lupe.
1:12:21
Hallelujah. This is your daughter. It's okay.
1:12:34
Hi. Um the day of of the revival that was in
1:12:41
um at the beach um I was getting ready. My sister came from Bakersfield and we were getting ready and I told my
1:12:49
sister, "Oh, let me put this sweater on because the AC is pretty cold out there, so I'm going to get prepared." And I was
1:12:54
actually wearing this sweater and um and and she said, "Really? It's really cold, you know." And then we come and then we
1:13:01
get here and no one was here. And I said, "What happened? It's the AC." And I'm like, "Oh my god." Like I came
1:13:07
prepared for that day. Um, and I go to the beach and then my daughter, my
1:13:12
8-year-old that's over there, um, uh, I realized that she's going to be exposed to the sun. And for the last four
1:13:20
months, she couldn't be out in the sun that for so long. Um, her skin all over.
1:13:25
It was like swollen, like almost like a sunburn. Every time she will go outside,
1:13:31
it will get red and wear red. I couldn't add anything because it will burn. And I
1:13:36
prayed and I said, "What is this? Is this spiritual? What is it, God? So, we went out there and I'm praying. I said,
1:13:42
"God, let it be your will." So, we go out there by faith and I'm looking at her like I had sun sunscreen and I add
1:13:49
some on and she was just playing in the sand. And I go there and then you prophetically say someone here something
1:13:56
with the exposure of like you can't be out like something to do with the skin.
1:14:02
I don't know how exactly you spoke it but right away I was like that's my daughter. I'm like I snatched the g the
1:14:08
miracle and my sister too cuz she knew about her and we're like this is for her God. This is for her. The next morning
1:14:15
um the dead skin was coming off like you know when when you have a rash or you
1:14:20
have psoriasis or eczema, it starts going white. It was falling off like
1:14:26
nothing. I kept touching her and it kept going and going off of her. And now she is healed and she don't have it anymore.
1:14:33
Yeah. She's okay. could be in the sun. She could be in the sun. She has the
1:14:38
scars and everything cuz she's a little bit dark, but you could see her skin is completely healed.
1:14:45
Yeah. And I was the one that fell in the water. Oh, yes. So that day as well, my sister was like,
1:14:51
"Sister, I'm really feeling it. We got to get baptized." And I looked at my sweater and I said, "Oh, but it's I don't want to get my sweater wet." And I
1:14:59
said, "I got to pray about it, but I'm really feeling it." She was going by faith. And next thing you know, I went
1:15:04
like this and I said, "Lord, give me whatever you have. I'm here to receive." Boom. I fell in the power of God.
1:15:10
In the water. In the water. And then I looked at my sweater. I think this is your will. And I got baptized that day.
1:15:18
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. When you surrender,
1:15:24
his he pushes you in his will. His will will be done when you
1:15:29
surrender. Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:15:35
Hallelujah. We're I'm so happy and excited for you, hun. Praise God.
1:15:41
Praise God. And I speak I speak that all scars would go completely in Jesus'
1:15:48
name. Total healing for and the skin completely now in Jesus name. May you
1:15:54
enjoy the sunshine, the light now in Jesus' name. Amen.
1:16:00
Hallelujah. Praise God. Wow. Praise God. These miracles are
1:16:08
amazing. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to God. Wow.
1:16:15
Thank you, Lord. I'm so excited for all the miracles he's going to do today. How about you?
1:16:21
[Music] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
Message
1:16:28
So I'm going to go into the teaching now. This is going to be part two of
1:16:33
last Sunday's the greatest in the kingdom which is you you have learned
1:16:38
are the servants ones who are servants one who have servant hearts and that's what Jesus said it the greatest in the
1:16:46
kingdom are those who become like children are those who are servants are those are those who serve all. Amen.
1:16:55
Praise God.
1:17:03
So today I'm going to be teaching some different um aspects of a servant
1:17:09
heart, some different directions for you of how to have more of a servant heart.
1:17:17
Are you ready? Hallelujah. Luke 5:33
1:17:24
says, "They said to him," John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do
1:17:29
the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking. Jesus answered, "Can you make the friends of
1:17:35
the bridegroom fast while he is with them, but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. In
1:17:41
those days, they will feast." He told them this parable. No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old
1:17:48
wine. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new wine will not match the old. And no one
1:17:55
pours new wine into old wine skins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins. The wine will run out and the
1:18:03
wine skins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wine skins.
1:18:11
So these Pharisees, they had a certain revelation from the Bible of what of
1:18:18
what they thought God was saying when it came to fasting. And their revelation they had was old wine. It wasn't the
1:18:26
true revelation of Jesus that Jesus came to bring which is full of grace and
1:18:34
freedom and having to do with the leading of the
1:18:39
Holy Spirit rather than separate from being in communication with the Holy
1:18:45
Spirit and just doing rituals religiously. So that is the big aspect of the old
1:18:54
wine that Jesus is talking about in this scripture. He's saying to the Pharisees,
1:19:00
you have an old wine doctrine that's about rituals, traditions, doing these
1:19:07
things religiously, doing these things in a performative way, doing these
1:19:12
things to check off the box on your list of things you have to do to be a good uh
1:19:18
follower of God rather than really being after God's heart.
1:19:27
There's this distance from God's heart when one has old wine. Doing things in
1:19:34
this religious ritual way and doing things without really being after God's
1:19:40
heart, listening to God's voice and hearing him speak. Do this, do this, do this for this purpose. Do this now for
1:19:47
this purpose. But rather just blindly doing things just to do them. Many times
1:19:53
doing it so you can feel like a good Christian. Many times doing it so you
1:19:59
can look like a great Christian. Look how great I am with all these
1:20:04
religious rituals I've done. Just like the Pharisees, that one Pharisee, he's
1:20:10
saying, "Lord, I thank you that I am so great. I tithe. I fast. I do this all
1:20:19
the time. I thank you, God, that I am this way." and not like this tax
1:20:24
collector over here, this sinner. And the Bible says that the sinner, the tax
1:20:30
collector who was humble before the Lord and genuinely repented from the heart, a genuine repentance, not just words,
1:20:38
empty words. That guy be was righteous before the Lord. That guy God said he is
1:20:47
righteous. He is he is really after my heart. He is saved. But the Pharisee, it
1:20:53
was the opposite. So that is how people are. I do this, I do
1:20:59
this, I do this. But they're far from God's heart. So this is how the Pharisees were. They were fasting all
1:21:07
the time. They were fasting and fasting and fasting and fasting. And they
1:21:12
weren't seeing Jesus and his disciples fasting this way. So they were questioning, "Why are you seemingly
1:21:18
going against the word of God?" Jesus wasn't going against the word of God. He was walking in the revelation from the
1:21:26
father. He was after the father's heart. And so everything he did, whether it's fasting,
1:21:34
whether it's praying, whether it's ministering, whether it's speaking,
1:21:39
anything he did was at the result of being after the father's heart. That's
1:21:46
where it came from. humbly
1:21:54
seeking the father's heart rather than thinking about how people see me.
1:22:01
Amen. So the major thing that God is doing in
1:22:07
this global revival is restoring the new wine.
1:22:16
There is so much old wine in the body of Christ today.
1:22:23
So much why last week I've taught a lot about this. The foundation of the body
1:22:29
of Christ has by and large not been accepted, received
1:22:35
and and and rejected by and large. According to Ephesians 2:20, it says the
1:22:41
this is New Testament, the foundation of the church are apostles and prophets
1:22:47
with Christ Jesus as the chief cornerstone. Then evangelists, pastors, and teachers
1:22:53
come and build the rest of the building like flooring and ceilings and windows,
1:22:59
but the foundation are the apostles and prophets. It's not much of a house with only only the only the foundation, but
1:23:06
it's also not going to stand very well and function very well if there's no foundation. We need all five.
1:23:14
And so, um, that is, you know, the, think about it, the foundation. We've,
1:23:19
the body of Christ by and large has lost the foundation, the foundation of the Jesus way, the foundation of the new
1:23:26
wine. And this has been an opportunity for the enemy to come and bring back this old wine as he masquerades as an
1:23:33
angel of light, deceiving people, sounding like God. Fast, fast, fast, pray, pray, pray in the religious ritual
1:23:40
way. That's what the devil's been doing to a lot of people. And so he's he's
1:23:45
he's the devil has brought the church back into the old wine by and large,
1:23:51
which is why we desperately needed revival. Many people didn't know why why they were crying out for revival. They thought it was for one reason. They
1:23:57
thought it was just for more people to be saved alone. But we were crying out for a revival because it was desperate
1:24:03
for the the the church itself first so we can be this bright light to shine in
1:24:09
the darkness so that more souls can be saved and really saved. Not religiously saved. Say, "Repeat after me, prayer,
1:24:14
but have no transformation, but be truly saved and transformed and be set free
1:24:20
from demonic spirits and sicknesses a and and and walk in abundant life to
1:24:26
shine brightly to the world and be transformed in the heart to be like Jesus." Amen.
1:24:33
So, this is the big thing that God is doing in this revival. He's restoring the foundation. He's restoring the
1:24:40
foundation that brings the fear of God. The prophets bring the fear of God. The apostles bring the fear of God as well.
1:24:46
The apostles bring the fear of God with the meaty teaching that brings revelation.
1:24:54
Not just repeating the word of God with very little revelation, milky
1:24:59
revelation, but with real revelation. Bringing a rama word that actually matures
1:25:06
believers. That's the big work of an apostle.
1:25:12
And they also prepare the way for prophets. They with this spiritual growth, it prepares the way for the
1:25:18
prophets to come and bring the fear of God through those these prophecies.
1:25:24
It opens up your spiritual eyes like woo and brings the fear of God. But people need to be prepared or else they can
1:25:31
hear the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light and they can reject the prophecies. So they have to be
1:25:38
prepared. So the apostles and prophets they bring the
1:25:44
fear of God even more so prophets but they mature and bring the fear of God.
1:25:53
Hallelujah. So now that we have this this Rama word
1:26:00
revelation coming, people's eyes are opening up to see how they've been acting like Pharisees, how they've been
1:26:07
in the old wine, how their life does not look like the believer's lives in the book of Acts. That's what's happening
1:26:12
now in this global revival. their eyes were opening up to see that
1:26:18
even though they've been a Christian for many years, many decades, they were they were living like a Pharisee
1:26:24
in in some way. Maybe not fullout Pharisee, ready to crucify Jesus, like you know, ready to speak against
1:26:30
servants of God of today. Not I don't even mean to that extreme, but in some ways maybe judgmental
1:26:36
in some ways just doing things in a performative religious way.
1:26:43
So in this revival, God is removing this deep, deep old wine.
1:26:52
This old wine that's gone deep in people for decades. And more than that, because
1:26:57
we're talking about parents and grandparents raising us up in old wine.
1:27:03
So it's like even deeper than decades that we've even lived. You know, it's even deeper that the the deepness of the
1:27:11
old wine. It's deep. All right. And so, all that being said, man, that really
1:27:18
should speak to all of you, to all of us, that this old wine isn't going to come
1:27:24
out overnight. That we should not be prideful to think
1:27:30
that all the old old wine's out.
1:27:36
The disciples were not even involved in the old wine. The disciples were not
1:27:43
Pharisees. They were they were just fishermen, tax collectors. So, they
1:27:49
weren't even in the old wine. That's a big reason why Jesus chose them because it would take even longer for people in
1:27:55
the old wine to be out of the old wine completely.
1:28:00
And he had to get moving with his work. He had to commission them out in three
1:28:06
years. But it's still these these blank slates,
1:28:11
it took them three years to learn the new wine.
1:28:17
These disciples, the first disciples that were with Jesus, three years.
1:28:24
And they were they're the disciples. I mean, their hearts were really
1:28:30
beautiful. They were leaders. They were chosen
1:28:35
leaders because God saw their hearts. So even these chosen leaders because the
1:28:40
more pure your heart is, the quicker you'll grow.
1:28:46
And it's up to you to purify your heart. It's up to you to humble yourself. You can choose how fast you'll grow. It's all up to you.
1:28:53
But those who have the purest hearts, most humble hearts, will grow the
1:28:58
fastest. So these disciples had the most pure hearts and still it took three years
1:29:07
for them to really get the new wine in them and be ready to represent Jesus
1:29:14
rightly. So
1:29:20
to to have a servant heart to be a servant to be a good servant means to unlearn
1:29:29
so much so that you can learn.
1:29:34
You have to humble yourself. You ha you have to be real with yourself. You have to look at your life as a believer prior
1:29:40
to stepping into the anointing. prior to stepping into the anointing
1:29:47
where your eyes have been opened up where some many of you you have been delivered of bondage you had for decades
1:29:53
and some of you this bondage led you to be in sin it it led you to not act Christlike this bondage that you carried
1:30:02
and you were a Christian for maybe decades but now you're totally free and now you've matured and transformed
1:30:09
quicker in a week in a month and a year than your whole life.
1:30:15
Why? Because of the power of God. Because of where you are planted.
1:30:20
The power of God is needed to bring this maturity.
1:30:26
For the fear of God to come, for you to be free,
1:30:32
for your eyes to open up to the new wine and take out the old wine and receive
1:30:38
the new wine. You need the power of God. We need the power of God.
1:30:45
Okay. So, oh man, it's so important for you to be to humble yourselves and be
1:30:51
real with yourself and say, "Okay, maybe decades of my life as a Christian. I was
1:30:58
in bondage. I listened to tons of different teachers. Yeah, I was in bondage. I wasn't growing. I didn't act
1:31:04
Christlike. I stayed lukewarm. I wasn't carrying the anointing like I am now,
1:31:10
walking in God's power. This is how I was. But now I have
1:31:17
stepped into the anointing. I have planted myself where the anointing is. The power of God is. I've stepped into
1:31:24
God's true move revival. And now all of the oppression's gone.
1:31:30
I'm I've now grown so much. I'm now Christlike like I never have been in my life. I've received impartation of
1:31:37
anointing. I have more peace and joy and abundant life than ever before. If that is true for you, if that is true
1:31:46
for you, some of you, it's your first time here. You don't, you're just listening right now. But some of you, and it will be
1:31:52
true for you. Hallelujah. But for many of you, this is your truth, what I'm speaking. Am I right?
1:31:58
Glory to God. You need to humble yourself and realize
1:32:05
that where you were listening to had old wine.
1:32:12
And you listen to how many teachings? And you had so much ad admiration, maybe
1:32:20
even idolizing some of these leaders who carried old wine.
1:32:26
And that's come in your heart. That's come in your heart.
1:32:33
When you admire somebody, when you admire them,
1:32:39
you start to be like them and you like certain things about them
1:32:46
and you want you want to be like that and then that comes in your heart.
1:32:53
And what you need to realize is that when you were in the old wine, there was so many things you thought were right
1:32:59
but was not right. it was wrong.
1:33:05
I see today, for example, I see I see a lot of Christians that act very judgmental.
1:33:12
And they they think they're just being bold
1:33:19
and calling evil evil and stuff, but they're really judgmental is the case.
1:33:27
And they're not showing compassion truly to those who were lost.
1:33:33
they're not showing compassion with their actions, with their words.
1:33:40
And so that's just an example like, you know, you can really admire someone who
1:33:45
is really judgmental because maybe they have a maybe they're a huge minister or
1:33:50
they have a huge platform. Maybe in the past you really admired admired that in someone,
1:33:58
you know, not knowing it was wrong, not knowing it wasn't Christlike.
1:34:04
And so what I want you to know is that when you step into the new wine, you have to understand that there's so much
1:34:10
you got to unlearn. It's not just it it's not just unlearning the things
1:34:15
like, oh, there's no apostles, no prophets, no power of God. To be truly in the new wine is not just
1:34:23
accepting miracles, deliverance, apostles and prophets. There's a lot more to the new wine than
1:34:28
that. the Jesus way.
1:34:34
How Jesus thought, spoke, acted.
1:34:42
We have not seen a lot of examples today up to today of of how Jesus would really
1:34:50
act, think, speak in today's time. Obviously, right? Because if we did, we
1:34:57
would have seen the power of God moving more and the ministries that Jesus the the the fruits that Jesus had, which we
1:35:03
clearly saw in the apostles, he told us, "Well, you'll do the things I do and greater." When I read the book of Acts
1:35:09
and I look at the life of the apostles, I look at the life of the five-fold ministers, I see Jesus in them. Do you?
1:35:17
They're literally doing the works that Jesus did. And Paul, he's speaking with boldness, but he has compassion and and
1:35:24
passion, and he remembers the grace God has given him, and he extends that grace
1:35:29
to everyone he ministers to. I see these disciples
1:35:35
show the fruits of Jesus from character to their works.
1:35:42
So since we have not seen what looks like the axe church by and large up till now in this revival, that
1:35:50
means that we have truly not have had
1:35:55
great examples of Jesus, representatives of Jesus,
1:36:01
of really how he would think, speak, and act today in situations of today.
1:36:07
Amen. So what what God really wants you to know today is that there is still so
1:36:14
much more humbling to go. There is still you need more of a servant heart
1:36:19
because there's still old wine. Some of you have been here for years. There's still old wine. I see it. And God is
1:36:26
helping you. But I I'm saying I'm being real. Humble yourself.
1:36:32
Humble yourself. God is calling you to lay down what you know. He's called you
1:36:39
to lay lay down these these things in your heart that you that that for years you admired
1:36:47
something. You admired somebody and it came deep in your heart and it's like
1:36:52
you love this thing. We're called to lay it all down for
1:36:57
Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:37:04
Praise God.
1:37:11
So, how how you do this is to really listen carefully to the teachings. There's sometimes when I preach where
1:37:18
I'm like, "Oh, I hope they hear me.
1:37:24
I hope they really hear me because I know they need this. I feel the heart of God.
1:37:31
Like, I hope they're not daydreaming. I hope they're not thinking about something else.
1:37:38
I hope they get the revelation of what I'm saying cuz they need this. I see it. I see the old one. They need it. They
1:37:47
need it. And so, I say to you, listen carefully.
1:37:56
Listen carefully. In the in the book of Acts, it says that
1:38:02
the believers blank themselves to the apostles
1:38:07
teaching. What is it? Devoted. The believers devoted
1:38:17
devoted devoted themselves
1:38:22
to the apostles teachings. devote yourself
1:38:28
like when you listen, you need to come with this humility and servant heart.
1:38:35
I got a lot of old wine in me in the past and it does not come out overnight
1:38:42
and I humble myself to know that there are aspects of me that need to change.
1:38:49
And so I'm gonna listen with all of my heart right now and I'm going to take these words as God's words
1:38:58
and and maybe you don't understand them at first because when things are in your heart so deep it's hard to understand.
1:39:07
When I I wanted to be a Christian pop EDM singer songwriter and I meditated on that. I believe it's like I had a sense
1:39:13
that I was called to ministry in a big way like to influence many people. I had
1:39:18
that sensing that God that sense that God put in me. I never could imagine it was a minister, an apostle ever because
1:39:25
public speaking was my big was my biggest fear and weakness. And so I was trying to find my calling for so long. I thought I finally found it in being this
1:39:32
singer. And I meditated on it a lot like this is going to happen. I believe
1:39:38
finally I found my calling. And I had so many friends and family members write to
1:39:43
me, I'm so proud of you. you're gonna make it. So many they never acted that
1:39:49
way before. And so this came in my heart. This came in my heart. This came in my heart. Like my dream of this
1:39:58
beautiful, good, godly dream to be a singer. It it was in my heart.
1:40:05
It was only about one year or so that it was in my heart deep that I received the
1:40:10
prophecy this week nine years ago that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus
1:40:15
Christ. Hallelujah. Glory to God. But when I heard that word, I didn't
1:40:22
understand it. I could not understand with my mind how this makes sense because public speaking
1:40:28
is my biggest fear and weakness. But singing was a gift and I enjoyed doing it. It doesn't add up
1:40:36
logically only spiritually. You need spiritual eyes, spiritual
1:40:41
understanding. You got to humble yourself. You got to trust God before understanding. Obey God before
1:40:46
understanding. And then the understanding comes. I understand full well now. But I didn't at first.
1:40:54
Even when I received the prophecy, I really thought I would do music just as much at first because my spiritual
1:41:01
father, Prophet Jav, who prophesied this calling to me, he wasn't like, "You're going to have to lay aside your music completely." He didn't say that right
1:41:08
away or anything. Actually, it just Holy Spirit started speaking that to me as time went on. But at first, I thought it
1:41:15
would be like at least 50/50. I'm still doing the music. That's what I thought.
1:41:22
I really thought that for for a while, for some months probably because it was deep in my heart that
1:41:27
this is a good godly thing and there's nothing wrong with it. But God had so much more
1:41:35
and I couldn't see it. I couldn't understand there. And so this is how it can be when you you you got to be
1:41:42
careful. You got to be careful
1:41:47
about intaking old wine. Are are you you got to be careful to not
1:41:53
be looking too many places. You got to be planted in one place.
1:41:59
When you uproot roots and you put them somewhere else, it dies. You put them
1:42:04
different places. You put them, you try to chop up the roots and put them different places, it will die.
1:42:11
This is God's principle of being planted in one church.
1:42:16
Everyone's called to be planted at one church and that means you're devoting
1:42:22
yourselves to the teachings there. You have to be careful that you're not unintentionally
1:42:32
breaking the strength of the roots in the ground by other voices you're listening to,
1:42:38
other examples you're seeing. First of all, are you seeing the fruits
1:42:43
of Jesus' character and and the works,
1:42:49
the miracles through this person you're listening to and watching?
1:42:54
No, I'm saying for anyone who you're listening to and watching, if you're not, but yet where you're
1:43:00
planted at, you're seeing those fruits, that's saying something.
1:43:06
It's saying that this person has some or maybe full old wine in them. Watch out
1:43:12
or that old wine that you haven't gotten out yet is going to stay there and keep growing
1:43:19
and keep you from growing spiritually.
1:43:24
The two very important scriptures
1:43:30
that will teach you how to get all of the old wine out and the new wine in.
1:43:36
is one, devote yourselves to the apostles teachings.
1:43:42
Two, imitate me as I imitate Christ. Paul said, you have only one spiritual
1:43:49
father, me. Paul's saying that that I'm your only father. This is New Testament
1:43:55
church. So, it's that means that it's God's will for everybody to have a spiritual father or mother.
1:44:03
This is New Testament church. This is Paul's example. He says, "You may have
1:44:08
other people you listen to teaching, but you only have one father." But by the way, this other teaching that he's talking about is not random teachers of
1:44:15
the old wine. He's talking about like within the five-fold ministry. As this ministry grows, we're going to have
1:44:20
other ministers. My spiritual father's church in Tanzania, they have apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. And they're all ministering
1:44:26
different times. We are in the beginning stages. God is laying the ground, the foundation of
1:44:32
this church here now. But as time goes on and people are raised up, people have gotten their old wine out enough because
1:44:38
we can't entrust somebody to teach here with 5% old wine in them. You got to get all that old wine before you're entrusted and anointed to teach the
1:44:45
people of God. That's why it's not fast, by the way,
1:44:51
that other people are raised up because this is a big extensive work that God's doing. Big surgery God's doing in
1:44:58
everybody's heart here. Getting all that old wine out. It'll go quicker as time goes on, but this is the beginning of
1:45:04
God restoring the new wine. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:45:10
Hallelujah. So, um, when he's saying when he's saying you have many teachers
1:45:15
but only one father, he's not talking about listening to other teachers from different places. In fact, he reprimands
1:45:21
people saying why are you not remembering the doctrine I taught you? You're listening to other people's
1:45:27
gospels of Jesus, doctrines of Jesus. He reprimands them.
1:45:32
Remember what I taught you, Paul said. The gospel I taught you. The new wine I
1:45:39
taught you. Paul says,
1:45:44
um, so when he's saying you have many teachers, he's talking about like like here in the church, it would be like if
1:45:50
there's other people who are teaching here, like it's good. It's great to listen to
1:45:56
those teachers. Yes. because they've been soaked in the new wine
1:46:02
and God has seen that they are ready to teach the new wine and represent him
1:46:07
adequately. But Paul is saying you have many teachers teachers within the same
1:46:13
ministry new wine but only one father. So you have to be very careful who you
1:46:19
are. Maybe you're not watching people's sermons but oh that social media.
1:46:27
Oh, that one minute clip can do a lot of damage if you're not careful.
1:46:36
Old wine and it touches that part of the old wine that you haven't given up yet and you're like, "Oh, yeah, that's good."
1:46:45
Because you liked being how you were in the past. You liked being religious. Made you feel good sometimes. You know
1:46:52
it. You liked being self-righteous. You liked judging people. Made you feel good. the flesh. The flesh feels good.
1:46:59
You see what I'm saying? So that part of the old wine that you haven't surrendered yet because your flesh likes
1:47:06
it. The flesh doesn't like being humble, by the way. Doesn't like being pure, but your flesh
1:47:13
likes it. So you see a one minute clip or something. Somebody preaching with old
1:47:19
wine, somebody speaking with judgment. Oh yeah, I like that.
1:47:25
And it reinforces that old wine in you. That's why I say the second most
1:47:31
important teaching of how to get the old wine out completely and the new wine in is imitate me as I imitate Christ.
1:47:41
Imitate. Imitate.
1:47:47
There's a scripture that Paul when Paul is speaking I'm telling you all these
1:47:52
scriptures I didn't write down because this is the Holy Spirit once again moving but Philippians 4:8
1:48:03
Paul says whatever is lovely admirable worthy of praise good think of such
1:48:09
things. But then it keeps going and it says, "Put into pra something like put into
1:48:18
practice everything you hear me teaching you and see me doing."
1:48:31
So you should not only be listening carefully to the teachings, but you should be watching on the pulpit, on the
1:48:38
altar, and outside
1:48:46
through social media. You can see outside, right? Through different through
1:48:52
different things. You can see outside. You can imitate Amen.
1:48:58
Hallelujah.
1:49:03
Glory to God. Glory to God. This is powerful new wine. This powerful what
1:49:09
the testimony of the woman shared how it it does say in the Bible that they laid seeds at the apostles feet. That's New
1:49:16
Testament. That's a powerful revelation to add on to what I shared last Sunday. you you
1:49:23
might be wondering why people are bringing offering forward on the stage. Go wa I can't go into another sermon
1:49:29
again of last Sunday's sermon. So please go watch last Sunday's message if you're confused. But real quick to summarize it
1:49:36
in Tanzania my spiritual father's church throughout the message they are bringing offering. They're bringing seeds
1:49:41
throughout the message because the there's this revelation that God has released there that
1:49:48
the words that are spoken that people want to grab them and see them solidified in their life and and
1:49:54
and have them be alive and work in their life. So like for example a certain revelation where you're like, "Oh, I
1:50:00
need this. Oh, I need this. That convicted me." for example, in the
1:50:06
message, you know, amen is a way that we like accept and receive it by speaking that.
1:50:12
But it's even an even deeper action to put a seed to that word. And that, you
1:50:19
know, sewing is sewing into God's kingdom. It advances his work, but at the same time, it's making a sacrifice
1:50:25
of what's important to us, special to us. It's a it's an action of like this
1:50:31
is so precious to me that I want to make a sacrifice for it. Not that we have to. Everything's free from God, but
1:50:39
God's worthy of this. Just like we offer him a sacrifice of praise, we offer him a sacrifice to serve him. Everything we
1:50:46
do is sacrificed to God. Amen. And so for things that like money has a hold on people's hearts. And even if it doesn't
1:50:52
have a hold, it's something of value. So that's why specifically there's power in
1:50:58
sewing because it's taking something that's valuable and giving it to God and saying, "I value this word that you've
1:51:05
just released and I really want this in my life. I value it. I want it to work
1:51:11
in my life now." Amen. Hallelujah.
1:51:23
So first Kings 16:9 this is when um Eli it says Elijah went from there and found
1:51:29
Elisha's son of Chafat. He was plowing with 12 yolk of oxin and he himself was driving the 12th pair. Elijah went up to
1:51:36
him and threw his cloak around him. So when Elijah did that, it was God telling him, Elisha is your is is called to be
1:51:45
your spiritual son and is called to be the one that receives the mantle I put upon you. So throw your cloak on him.
1:51:52
It's a picture of throwing the anointing. Now the anointing was immediately coming upon him now, but it was the meaning of that was come serve
1:51:58
me. God's calling you to serve me so that the anointing can then flow in your life as you become a true servant
1:52:04
through your service. You cannot become a servant by not serving.
1:52:10
You can never become a leader by not first following.
1:52:16
So to be a servant leader, you have to first serve a leader, your leader, and
1:52:22
follow. So Elisha then left his oxen and ran
1:52:30
after Elijah. So he left the things that were important to him. He immediately left them when when God called him to
1:52:37
follow Elijah. And he says, "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye and then I will come with
1:52:43
you." "Go back, Elijah replied. What what have I done to you?" So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yolk of oxin and slaughtered them. He burned the
1:52:50
plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and become
1:52:56
his servant. He didn't set out to Elijah and become equal with Elijah
1:53:03
or slightly below Elijah. He became his servant.
1:53:13
Elijah was doing very important works for God. God had called him to be this
1:53:18
prophet and do great works, miracles. And so when Elisha came under him and
1:53:25
became his servant, what he did was make it so that more of this amazing work of God going through Elijah could go forth.
1:53:35
He assisted him. He helped him so that more of this work could go forth.
1:53:42
Amen. This is the kingdom government mindset. Um this is the kingdom being kingdom-
1:53:49
minded. Um, you know, like when my
1:53:54
spiritual father, you know, he prophesied to me that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ. He called, he said that I was called to receive
1:54:00
imitation of this anointing that he carried. And um, but like my heart, I
1:54:06
didn't want to be a minister. In my heart when I saw him, I had never seen God move through him. I I never seen God
1:54:12
move ever like that. I had never seen God move in power through anybody like that ever.
1:54:19
And the way that the power of God, the love of God touched me through him,
1:54:24
changed me like never before. Brought me closer to Jesus like never before in my
1:54:30
past whole entire life of 25 years of being a Christian. And we need apostles
1:54:37
and prophets. And so when I saw this prophet for the first time, I'm like, the world needs this blessing. The body
1:54:43
of Christ needs this blessing. They need prophets. And he's the only prophet I had seen. So for me it was like they need you. The world needs you. The world
1:54:50
needs to receive this ministry through you. Like I have because I I've been to so many churches over the years. So many
1:54:58
I've listened to so many teachings what I thought were the best teachers, pastors out there and nothing compares
1:55:05
to the power of God, the love of God, the transformation that's come in my life through that that I have received
1:55:11
through you as a vessel. It's very passionate. is very passionate
1:55:17
about what God was doing through him to reach the world to reach more people cuz
1:55:23
I was set on fire and I was fully surrendered when I wanted to be surrendered my whole life. I went to sermon after ser uh church service after
1:55:30
church service raising my hand saying the repeat after me prayer but no change was happening but I encountered the
1:55:35
power of God through a true anointed vessel through a true prophet and I'm set on fire fully surrendered for the
1:55:41
first time in my life transformed wildly so in love with Jesus so full of joy so
1:55:46
full of peace and so obviously I want that for everybody so zealous hallelujah so um
1:55:55
but Like that was not wrong. Like that was right.
1:56:01
Like it it's so it would have been so prideful for me to be like I want to be like that.
1:56:08
When he when this was prophesied over me, I wasn't like oh wow. I get to do these wonders like that. That's going to
1:56:15
be awesome. No, I was like what me?
1:56:20
You know, I mean, I was I humbled myself to see I'm not that
1:56:28
I'm not that that I see in this mighty servant of God and God's calling me to like be like that. What you know, I I
1:56:36
humbled myself to see that truth, you know, and so I had such a heart for just
1:56:42
like the work of God happening through him to expand.
1:56:47
But God told me that that's the right heart. It's a rare heart. Like it's rare to
1:56:55
have to think that way because of the lack of purity in the
1:57:01
body of Christ by and large today. There's a lot of pride, a lot of selfish
1:57:06
ambition. So a lot of people's responses when they see someone walk in the power of God is
1:57:12
like, I want that. I want that power. I want people to admire me like that. I
1:57:19
want that honor. That's that's what's in a lot of people's hearts.
1:57:25
And there's also jealousy. And there's also skepticism. Why is he so favored?
1:57:33
It's common because of the lack of purity in the body of Christ today. And so all that being said, people are so
1:57:40
individualist an individualisticly mind. They have a mindset of being so
1:57:45
about themselves is what I mean. And instead of building something
1:57:51
together, building the kingdom of God together, that's so common today. And we got to
1:57:58
get out of that. We got to come into the new wine. And this is what God is speaking to you today. That that he is
1:58:04
building something here at 5F Church. And he wants you to devote yourselves to building that
1:58:11
and lay down everything else and respond to God's call of what he's
1:58:18
asking you to do. I had to lay down and and a lot of these
1:58:25
things are good godly things. You have pursuits. You have hobbies. And these are good godly things just like my
1:58:31
Christian music pursuit. But God called me to lay down that
1:58:38
pursuit, hobby, passion completely. Even though in my mind, it's going to
1:58:45
lead people to Jesus. It's going to bring good to the world. It's going to encourage to worship Jesus
1:58:51
in spirit and truth. My my great music pursuit.
1:58:57
But God said, "Lay it down because I need you to be 100% fully
1:59:04
devoted to being an apostle to building this church I've called you to to to
1:59:10
plant to equipping your the people." I was thinking about this. I was meditating on
1:59:15
this. I was thinking, "Wow, imagine if I kept in my heart this music so much and
1:59:23
I refused to not keep doing it." And so I made time to write music and film
1:59:30
music videos and record and all of that. This is just not God's will for my life right now. It's his will for me to be
1:59:36
fully devoted on what he's called me to as an apostle. But what if I kept doing that music
1:59:42
pursuit? I was thinking about right now. I was like, well, like here are some examples. There wouldn't be Secret of
1:59:49
the anointing book. There wouldn't be unlock your deliverance book. There wouldn't be the walking miracles course. There wouldn't be live streams through
1:59:55
the week because I devote myself to this calling.
2:00:01
Like I devote myself devote
2:00:10
like I don't even have like my my my hobbies have to be um my exercise like
2:00:16
hiking and swimming. I I don't even devote other time for like hobbies because God has called me
2:00:22
to be fully devoted to this work. And this is what God is calling you to.
2:00:29
This is what God is calling you to to be fully devoted to this work of God. You
2:00:34
know the work of the church. It says, you know, when you read the book of Acts, it says they devoted themselves to the apostles teachings. It also says
2:00:41
that signs, wonders, and miracles were were being performed by the apostles. And it also says they were that they had
2:00:47
so much favor upon them. And it says they were adding to their number every day. It also says that all who were sick
2:00:54
and oppressed they brought under the shadow of Apostle Peter and all were healed. All of these things are having
2:01:00
to do with the church. None of these things are having to do with all these believers doing their own
2:01:06
thing in an individualistic way. Come on.
2:01:11
The greatest works, the greatest miracles are happening in the church. All the believers are called, all who
2:01:17
believe, these signs shall follow them. Cast out demons, they will lay hands on the sick and they will be healed. You're all called to walk in the power of God.
2:01:23
You're all called to minister to people, but it's for the purpose of bringing them into the kingdom. And the kingdom has order. The kingdom has order that
2:01:30
people, the believers would be planted in a church where God's kingdom government gives them the equipping, the
2:01:36
teaching, the impartation, the high level anointing to heal and deliver them. And so that all the believers
2:01:43
would be freed, healed, equipped, spiritually protected from the cover for by the covering, equipped, receive
2:01:50
impartation to be doing what God has called them to do on this earth to really be anointed and be this bright
2:01:57
light in the world. You can't do it without the church, without the equipping of the five-fold ministry.
2:02:03
So the most important work of God is in the church because everything flows from what
2:02:10
happens in the church. The believers thrive because what they have received in at the church. You rece what you're
2:02:18
receiving here. You're receiving the fire, the power of God. No demons are holding you back anymore from being a
2:02:24
mighty vessel of God. You're in the truth. You have victory over the devil. Now your spiritual eyes are opened up.
2:02:30
Devil can't play around with you anymore. So now you are beaming with the light of God, the anointing as you walk
2:02:36
out of the church. Now people see the glory of God on you like when they saw Moses and they are compelled to talk to
2:02:43
you to to to come to your light. Hallelujah. Yeah. Jesus,
2:02:52
you are free. No demons holding you back. You are free from the old wine. No
2:02:58
lies of the devil condemning you. So you can really love people well.
2:03:05
Hallelujah. And so it's old wine. This is the
2:03:11
opposite of old wine. Get this in you. It's opposite of old wine.
2:03:18
If you are asked to serve at Five Church in any way, if you are asked to serve at Five Church
2:03:24
in any way, this is an honor.
2:03:30
And you were if you were asked, you are called to devote yourself.
2:03:36
I was thinking about like the worship team. They are practicing their instruments.
2:03:43
They are rehearsing throughout the week. And now when they get up there, because they're all doing it, everyone can
2:03:50
worship Jesus with no distractions of like a wrong note
2:03:57
or or or being off pitch when singing. Like it matters to devote yourself to
2:04:04
what God has called you to serve in. But what if one one of the worship team
2:04:12
members says, you know, it's amazing how God God has provided every single person
2:04:18
who serves at 5F Church perfectly. Like just the right amount of people for the season we're in is what God has brought.
2:04:25
Like it's shocking. It's shocking. Like just the like he's like like he handpicked you. You you
2:04:33
you. I put this gifting in you and I need to use you now. in my kingdom. And I'm going call you to I'm calling you to
2:04:40
devote yourself now with this gifting that you had. I need this gift now for my kingdom to expand for to reach my
2:04:46
people. That's what happens when God asks you to serve. And so I was thinking about like the
2:04:52
worship team I was thinking about what if the this this is fictional by the way. This is fictional. But I was just thinking like a what if to share this
2:04:59
point with you. What if one of the worship team members, we ask them to play, we ask them to play their
2:05:05
instrument and they're the only ones we know who play an instrument. And that's a true story. That's not even fictional.
2:05:11
But but they're like, "Well, you know, God's really called me to
2:05:17
like write my write music for myself about God and put it on my platform.
2:05:24
And also I need to go out and evangelize to people on the streets. So because of
2:05:32
this and this and this and I also work, I therefore can only play my instrument maybe once a month.
2:05:40
And then we're stuck. We don't have anyone to play the other weeks.
2:05:46
Do do you do you get what I'm saying? I'm trying to show you how good godly things can hold you back from how God is
2:05:53
calling you to be doing very important works for his kingdom.
2:06:01
You playing on the worship team, you're leading worship to thousands and millions of people. They're tuning in
2:06:08
every week and they're worshiping God.
2:06:13
That is huge. That is a big work. that God has called you to. Editors,
2:06:23
we have an amazing editing team that devote themselves to to to editing the videos with excellence.
2:06:31
And the excellence is very important. And I have an example that's amazing.
2:06:37
This this there's a video of this little boy who was so precious. He came with this most beautiful heart just so
2:06:44
emotional wanting his mom to be in heaven because she was in sin. So wanting her to come to Jesus. And so
2:06:51
this is just all he says. It's this prayer request. And this video we put on I I I shared with one of our the people
2:06:58
on our editing team. I shared let's post this video. It was from like a year ago. I said let's post this video. And so her
2:07:07
and I worked together with excellence in the area of create creativity
2:07:14
a a and strategy like how can we really make this video excellent you know we
2:07:20
ended up putting a title over it like describing what's happening in that moment so maybe people are compelled to
2:07:26
keep watching if they feel like scrolling or something and we just like took time with this video
2:07:34
and gave it our all. And this video,
2:07:39
it's been going, it was posted three weeks ago and it's been going viral for three weeks non-stop.
2:07:46
And glory to God. But it has 2.6 million views as of last night. And what's so
2:07:54
amazing, it show it can show you analytics on social media, which is amazing, but it shows how many people
2:08:00
became followers through that video.
2:08:06
Any guesses? Well, some of you know, you found my story. I told you yesterday. Don't say
2:08:11
if you know. As of last night, it was almost 19,000
2:08:16
people.
2:08:24
three weeks. In three weeks, another thing is that there's this feature, I've
2:08:30
told you in the past about this, but there's this feature where we could choose to put this reel out to only
2:08:37
people that don't follow me. And I could literally see who watched it
2:08:42
that were followers and who were non-followers. And it was 99 something% non-followers.
2:08:49
So 2.5 million people who maybe did not know about God's revival, who maybe have
2:08:55
never encountered God's power, they just saw that through that video in the past 3 weeks. 2.5 million people.
2:09:06
But like if that one on the editing team was like, "No, I got to do this good
2:09:13
godly thing. I got to do this good godly thing. I got to do this good godly thing." Now, don't get me wrong, it's very important we make it priority to be
2:09:20
in the word and spend time with Jesus and rest and everything, but I'm talking about like good godly pursuits, like my
2:09:26
music, for example. But what if this person had these good godly pursuits and they're like, "Uh, I just I can't do
2:09:32
that yet." It literally would would have been put on the back burner.
2:09:39
and 18,000 people that are now followers that I believe have become saved,
2:09:44
healed, delivered in the past three weeks through this video, they wouldn't have.
2:09:50
I'm trying to get you to see the magnitude of the work of God at the church.
2:09:56
That when God asks you to serve, see the value and devote yourself. Don't
2:10:02
treat it casual because it's holding back people from
2:10:08
receiving. When thousands could receive like that because God's ready to move mightily.
2:10:15
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:10:23
Thank you, Jesus. Um
2:10:34
I lastly want to share something that's important about having this servant heart and how to to receive this new
2:10:41
wine is that um it's very important that we do things in order. That's a big job
2:10:48
of the apostle as well is they bring order. God has God is a God of order, not
2:10:54
confusion. And it says in in um Matthew 12:25, Jesus knew their thoughts and
2:11:00
said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself
2:11:07
will not stand." The more a church is divided,
2:11:14
the less powerful it will be. The more a church is united, a ministry
2:11:20
is united, a revival army is united, the more powerful it will be.
2:11:29
We need to be united in the new wine. It's very important.
2:11:35
And like I said, the new wine is not only about accepting the power of God, deliverance, apostles, and prophets,
2:11:43
but it also is revering the the the these the principles of God that you
2:11:49
haven't heard of before, like order. And I have teachings on order. If you
2:11:55
don't know what I mean by order, and please watch them. It's very important and foundational.
2:12:01
But like in the old wine there's it's people are just laying hands on everybody and some people are carrying
2:12:07
demons, some people have witchcraft in them. They're laying hands on people.
2:12:13
No, you know, there's an order of how to pray for people that we see exhibited
2:12:18
through the apostles through Jesus and the apostles walking in authority by the
2:12:23
command demons must go. But not everybody's shouting commands at one time. But the one like Peter, all who
2:12:30
came under Peter, they were all healed and delivered because he carried a high level anointing and he carried true authority and is how it works in the
2:12:35
spiritual realm. When they really know how to execute their authority and they're not doing it out of order,
2:12:42
the demons have to obey. Amen. So, that's an example of order, but there's a lot of different things that have to
2:12:47
do with order. And one of the meanings of order is that we are all aligned and
2:12:55
united in the vision. At 5F Church, where you're planted, for example, we you you are submitted to the
2:13:02
vision there. You humble yourself to the vision there. Amen.
2:13:08
And and you you you are you are aligned
2:13:14
with the fact that you want you don't want anything that you do
2:13:20
to confuse somebody like something old wine that you do
2:13:25
because in the world of social media, everybody's watching everybody. A lot of you people here, people know
2:13:32
you full well because you're on my stories, you're in the videos, and they follow you on Instagram. You
2:13:39
have a big responsibility to represent Jesus rightly. You are an ambassador
2:13:44
of 5F Church on your social media page
2:13:49
and in anything else you do, how you act, how you speak, anything you do. It's very important that you are not
2:13:56
putting out old wine because that confuses people because people admire
2:14:02
you. They've heard your testimonies online. They admire you. Maybe they wrongly put you on a pedestal because
2:14:08
they've seen you on social media or something. They see you like a celebrity or something. And so then you you you do
2:14:14
something that's old wine. You say something that's old wine. Maybe it's like, you know, I've done a teaching of
2:14:20
how to pray the Jesus way. Maybe something comes out about prayer. The way you talk about it or something is
2:14:25
old wine. It brings confusion. Oh, I look up to this person. So, wait, I'm confused now cuz that doesn't seem like
2:14:32
what I learned. You see, you see how dangerous it can be. Confusion brings division. So, you
2:14:40
need to have the fear of God to not ever bring confusion to the believers.
2:14:46
Confusion of the mixture of old wine and new wine. How do you do that?
2:14:51
Don't be quick to do something that you're not sure is old wine or new wine.
2:14:58
Imitate me as I imitate Christ, it says. So don't be quick to do something you
2:15:03
haven't seen be taught or done here.
2:15:08
Do you understand that? If you have a question in your mind like I don't know,
2:15:17
here's here's a great example. Okay, here's an example I'm going to give you, but I want you to take it in your own life. It doesn't have to be this
2:15:23
specific example. Imagine everybody know if you don't
2:15:29
know, yoga is demonic because the origin of yoga was to
2:15:35
worship another god. And so the poses that they are doing are literally to
2:15:41
worship that god. And so because it's having to do with literal worship to a god, that's what makes it demonic. So if
2:15:50
you're playing worship music and not meditating on that god, you're still
2:15:55
like doing the positions of worship to that God. So what you should instead do
2:16:01
is stretch your body that's not in those positions, that exact positions of worship.
2:16:08
Amen. But someone can come here and maybe they I don't teach on yoga a lot how it's
2:16:15
demonic. It's in my unlock your deliverance book. Maybe they haven't read it. I haven't talked about it in maybe a year or something, but they've
2:16:21
been coming for a year. But all of a sudden sudden they get this great idea. They get this great idea
2:16:28
that they are going to start Christian yoga and invite people and they're going
2:16:34
to play worship music and they're going to talk all about God throughout it.
2:16:39
and they think this is a great way to invite people to 5F Church. You're going to have flyers there.
2:16:48
But do you see how someone could so easily do that? So the right thing to do is you get this
2:16:55
idea. You got to be aware. The devil can masquerade himself as an angel of light sometimes, especially if you have a little old wine left in you. You got to
2:17:02
be aware. So if you get an idea like this, if you haven't heard me talk about yoga,
2:17:08
don't do it. Play on the safe side.
2:17:14
So I share that with everything. If you haven't heard me teach on certain topics, don't start promoting a certain
2:17:21
topic. You see what I'm saying?
2:17:27
If you haven't heard me say a certain cross cross necklace or something in a certain way with Jesus on it or
2:17:33
something is demonic or just don't go out and start to teach somebody. Do you see what I'm saying? But your
2:17:40
social media, the revival army sees. So it's so important you have this fear of
2:17:47
God to not confuse anybody because people wrongly look to you sometimes
2:17:54
as a leader. or maybe it will just confuse them. They don't see you as a leader, but it just confuses them. And
2:18:00
that's the scheme of the devil to slow down revival. I want you to have the fear of God of this. This is very
2:18:06
important. So, if there's anything that you It's very important you're in order. You
2:18:12
know, the Philippines uh the small group in the Philippines,
2:18:17
the the small group leaders, they they they did things the right way. They did things in order. They did things in
2:18:23
respect. and they have this great idea of how to shine their light in a new way of how to expand revival because this is
2:18:31
very important. You all are creative and with your new ideas to reach more people. But as much as you are being
2:18:39
enthusiastic to be creative, you have to be just as uh uh careful to not go out
2:18:45
of order. Be in line and make sure that you are submitting
2:18:50
this to to God's vision. making sure you're in order. Amen. So,
2:18:56
the small group leaders, there's one of the small group leader, she had this idea to rent um to pay for a cinema to
2:19:03
rent it out and play this uh the Revival Now event, but she did the right thing.
2:19:08
She asked me, she reached out, I have this new creative idea of how to
2:19:15
reach more people, but this is something new. This is something different. This is something different. new creative,
2:19:22
you know, that's big that affects a lot of people. So, we better make sure we're doing the
2:19:27
right thing and also representing 5F correctly and Jesus correctly. And so, I
2:19:33
I said, "Yes, this is an amazing idea." But then they also were respectful and made sure that they didn't make their
2:19:39
own graphics and stuff, but made sure that they got the the graphics approved
2:19:45
because you see it's in the mall those big signs.
2:19:50
Excellence matters. There's a reason I don't dress sloppy at
2:19:55
church. I got to represent my king. I'm a a daughter of the king.
2:20:01
And in heaven, the the there's there's there's gold. There's all these jewels
2:20:08
everywhere. We we we got to be beautiful. It doesn't it doesn't matter like moneywise doesn't
2:20:14
matter, but we have to be presentable and represent Jesus rightly. And so that matters with graphic design because we
2:20:22
want to reach as many people as possible. When we come with excellence, we're going to reach as many people as
2:20:28
possible. We're going to catch those fish that judge the book by its cover.
2:20:34
You see what I'm saying? So, if you have if you ever have like a a a great idea
2:20:39
that involves really reaching more people, but it's new, it's something different that you you you know, you get
2:20:44
that conviction like, I probably should just give Apostle Katherine a heads up and ask her if this is in line with the
2:20:50
vision and everything. Do that. That's very important
2:20:56
so that we can God can use you the most powerfully he wants to use you rather than the enemy sneaking in and bringing
2:21:03
confusion. Amen. Amen. And also, I just want to say, I
2:21:10
think this might be obvious to most people, but like in the future, oh wait, wait, before I say that, I also want to
2:21:15
say here's another example of it. Social media pages. This is a big area. You you need to make sure you're in order
2:21:21
because there's all those scammers out there, those fake pages, you know, of me.
2:21:26
There's so many impersonators of me and of 5F. So, we got to be careful on social media, right? And so like someone
2:21:33
there's been people who have made pages for the purpose of wanting to bring wanting to to reach out to people to
2:21:40
show them God's power. They want to lead them to come to 5F church to encounter Jesus. And so they start a page and they
2:21:48
put all just videos of 5F 5F videos just like reposting them for
2:21:53
example. And I have shared with them when they asked to be in make sure they're in order. I asked, "Well, make
2:21:58
sure I told them, make sure you put the word fan page because that's a technical term these days to show that things
2:22:04
aren't um impersonators." So, I said, "In the bio, put fan page."
2:22:09
And make sure you are very clear in the bio and the description of how to
2:22:15
receive from God more through this video. Make sure you put 5Furch at me,
2:22:21
my username, because this is serious. This is a this is an opportunity through every post,
2:22:28
through every video to reach someone who's lost.
2:22:33
It's like if you were on an airplane. I was with on the airplane with somebody a couple of weeks ago. There were I mean there was a a gentleman sat next to me.
2:22:39
He started opening up to me out of nowhere just opening up and sharing how um he would act he that very day he
2:22:46
acted out in anger towards someone and he was feeling really convicted about it but like he he also felt like he did the
2:22:52
right thing but he wasn't sure. And so I knew this was a divine appointment for me to share with him about deliverance
2:22:58
and how Jesus can deliver you. But I didn't stop there. I I I gave him my social media
2:23:05
information. I gave him the information for my books and he ended up downloading both of the audio books by the time the
2:23:10
flight landed. Glory to God. And this is someone who wasn't a follower of Jesus.
2:23:17
But like what if I had stopped short when he had opened up so much? Now it's
2:23:22
different. Sometimes God calls us just plant seeds cuz someone's not really open. But he's opened up so much. What if I had just said Jesus can deliver you
2:23:29
period? How tragic that would be. What a missed opportunity where I could have led him
2:23:38
under Apostle Peter's shadow. I could have led him. This is where the people go to be free and healed.
2:23:45
So you have a very you need to to have the fear of God with your social media posts in your captions like if when you
2:23:54
share share how people can receive. Amen.
2:24:00
Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So I want to just encourage all of you to have
2:24:07
this fear of God to be in order. You need to know that it's old wine to not be in order. And so you need to really
2:24:13
tread carefully and make sure you're not bringing confusion in any way by going out of
2:24:20
order. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
2:24:26
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. I'm so excited for what God is going to do
2:24:32
after this word because when we are more united, God can move more powerfully and
2:24:38
at a greater speed. When we are all in order, when we are all united,
2:24:43
when we all have servant hearts together, this is when the anointing pours out more and God sees we're ready
2:24:50
to to expand more and more and reach more of his people. Amen. So, I encourage you to take this word to
2:24:56
heart. I see this message as one of the most important messages ever. Like, bookmark this, listen to this, take
2:25:03
notes on this, listen to this again and again and again. Amen. Hallelujah. I
2:25:09
want to invite you all to serve uh to to serve God by sewing right now and serve.
2:25:15
That was prophetic. I want to invite you to serve serve God at 5 Church. If you
2:25:21
have gifts, if you have abilities, email us. Let us know if you are ever asked to serve. Give your all to it. Knowing how
2:25:31
much more powerfully God will use you when you really devote yourself. Amen.
2:25:36
One of the one of the big ways of serving God is through your seed too. Those of you that have uh finances,
2:25:43
that's a big way of serving of contributing to God's work as well. So if that if you have that seed that God
2:25:50
has blessed you, take that seriously. Devote yourself to serving God in this
2:25:56
way that uniquely you were brought to fulfill this need and advance his kingdom in. Amen. Hallelujah.

2:30:32
ever regret and give your life to him. Just tell him, "Jesus, I give my life to you." That's all you have to do is
2:30:39
confess that Jesus is Lord and and and believe in your heart. Hallelujah.

surrender it from your heart because when you do that, God will then help you to see what's been stuck.
2:31:25

2:31:32
that I like. Maybe I don't even realize I like something and it's actually old wine. Lord, I want it out. If it's not

Corporate Prayer
2:51:45
is the only miracle worker? [Applause]
2:51:50
Jesus. no human being. He calls us healers. He says, "Heal the
2:51:57
sick." But we know it means it's God's power doing it.
2:52:02
It's all him. We're vessels. He chooses to partner, but it's all Jesus.
2:52:08
And so, it's so important that you don't see the vessel and Jesus as the same or
2:52:15
the vessel is higher, of course, but it's only Jesus's power.
2:52:21
So, it's Jesus's power that heals and delivers. Whether it's through a oneon-one prayer or through a word
2:52:28
spoken from a distance, even like the centurion soldier, his he came with faith. Jesus, he says, "You can only
2:52:35
say, you only have to say the word. You, my servant, doesn't need a one-on-one prayer. Only say the word, Jesus." And
2:52:40
he said the word and he was healed. And Jesus says, "I've never seen faith like this." Just believe. It's not about a
2:52:46
feeling. Just believe in the power of God. Not in the power of a person. Not
2:52:51
in a power of me. Believe in the power of God. Believe in that same power that
2:52:57
healed a centurion sold soldier servant is moving here today to touch you where
2:53:03
you are. To touch you where you are watching across the world. Say right
2:53:09

2:53:16
only have the power to heal, deliver, and do any miracle.
