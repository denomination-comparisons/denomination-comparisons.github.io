I am so excited for all that God's going to do on this live stream today. Welcome everybody that's just tuning in.
0:06
Share if you haven't already. Uh today is a special day. I wanted to celebrate
0:12
with you all reaching 1 million subscribers on my YouTube channel. This
0:18
is such a win for the kingdom of God. This is something to celebrate because
0:24
this is the work of God. this my YouTube channel, all of my social media channels, they are gods and all that I
0:32
do on these on this YouTube channel and on all social media channels um I do
0:37
with the leading of the Holy Spirit and they are offered to God and the ministry
0:42
the ministry that I do this is something I never wanted to do. This is something
0:48
I couldn't have dreamed desired in a million years.
0:53
I never could have dreamt this up. I never could have imagined or wanted to do this, but this is what God has asked
1:00
me to do. This is my calling. This is purely instruction from God to do
1:07
ministry, to minister to all of you, to all of God's people on my social media
1:13
channels, on my YouTube channel. So, this is the work of God. Hallelujah.
1:18
This is 1 million at least 1 million many more even who see the videos but
1:24
haven't yet subscribed yet. But this is celebrating 1 million plus of people receiving God's power being equipped to
1:32
have victory over the enemy and be equipped to walk in their calling. This
1:38
is a celebration of so many who are who have encountered God's love through the screen and his power through the screen
1:45
and have been delivered and healed. And this is a celebration of the victory of
1:50
Jesus over the enemy, over the enemy,
1:56
using people over every scheme of the devil to try to stop God's people from
2:01
encountering his power, from encountering his love, from their eyes being opened up to the truth, and from
2:08
receiving the anointing, receiving this revival, and stepping into this revival.
2:14
Jesus has the victory over his move, over for his people, for his revival
2:21
army. Jesus always has the victory every day, no matter what. Always and forever,
2:28
Jesus has the victory. And when we stand with Jesus, when we choose Jesus, when we choose to surrender our lives to
2:34
Jesus, we are on his side. We are on his team. So Jesus having victory equals us
2:42
having victory equals you having victory when you choose Jesus when you choose
2:48
surrender. Hallelujah. So we are champions of God. You are a champion of
2:55
God if you have chosen Jesus. If you have chosen to stand with Jesus and you
3:00
have overwhelming victory. The Bible says that God gives us overwhelming
3:06
victory. Hallelujah. So I wanted to
3:12
take time today to celebrate with you all what God has done, the victory he
3:19
has brought, the doors he has opened and celebrating many souls, 1 million plus
3:25
souls who have come closer to Jesus, encountered his love and power. also
3:31
celebrating today that we are doing the greater
3:36
things that Jesus promised. He says, "You will do the things I did and greater." And whoa, what an unbelievably
3:45
exciting time to live in right now that we are experiencing
3:51
the limitless power of God like never before. It's like through through
3:57
technology that's available today, through social media, we are getting to
4:02
experience the limitless power of God in ways that that that generations past
4:09
haven't because of the days we're living in, because of these days of doing the
4:14
greater things that Jesus spoke about. So, what a time to be alive. Thank you
4:19
Jesus for what you are doing, what you have done,
4:24
opening doors. Thank you Jesus for opening up doors on social media, for opening up doors supernaturally to reach
4:33
your people who need you, who want you, who need freedom, who need healing, who need a touch from you, who need to know
4:41
your love. Thank you, Jesus, for opening up these doors. Thank you Jesus for
4:48
opening up door after door after door, a million doors for this moment right now
4:54
to reach this milestone of 1 million
4:59
subscribers on YouTube. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
5:05
I want to first of all thank all of you who have subscribed to my YouTube channel. I want to also thank all of you
5:12
who have shared my videos on YouTube and of course on every social media
5:17
platform. But I want to thank you for doing that, for having a heart for
5:23
people to receive as you have received, for having a heart for people to be healed and delivered and encounter God's
5:29
power in love. Thank you. Because it's because of you that God has been able to
5:35
open up so many doors. Um, this is how social media works. A big way that
5:42
social media works is by spreading the good news is by sharing the videos,
5:48
interacting with the videos, with the with the posts. Because first of all,
5:53
who you share it to, they see it where they wouldn't have seen it otherwise. But also, the way I think most of you
6:00
know by now, if you don't know, there's this thing called the algorithm. But it's literally how social media works on
6:07
every different social media. The more that a video or post is engaged with,
6:14
um, the algorithm gives it favor. The algorithm um spits it out into the the
6:22
the social media universe. it it spits it out to more people's um feeds,
6:30
timelines, whatever they're called into their where where where it will pop up and they will see it. So um whenever a
6:39
video goes viral, it doesn't just go viral randomly. It goes viral because
6:44
people have engaged with the video and have made it so that it it can then
6:51
reach more people. So, so you are such a big part of this moment of 1 million
6:59
people plus encountering Jesus's love and power through the screen. Um, you
7:06
are such a big part of this. You know, for the 1 million subscribers
7:11
to happen, it is all God. And it also takes our obedience. It took my obedience. It took um the 5F church
7:19
editing team and social media team and their obedience and it also took your
7:26
obedience. Those of you that have shared the videos, interacted with the videos,
7:32
this you are you are literally a part of this. You are the revival army is
7:37
literally a part of this milestone victory for Jesus for for his kingdom
7:44
for revival. Hallelujah. So I celebrate you today. I thank you today. I thank you on behalf of God's kingdom, for for
7:52
being obedient to God and having a heart for Jesus, for what he wants, for his
7:57
move, and having a heart for God's people to be free to encounter his love
8:03
and power and be healed and walk in their calling and receive impartation of
8:08
anointing and be set on fire for Jesus. Amen. There's so much that God is doing
8:15
through these videos. Glory to God. There's so much, so many miracles, so
8:21
much equipping. He's speaking. There's so much. And I I thank Jesus. I thank
8:27
you, Lord. I thank you for having no bounds and moving through social media,
8:33
moving through the screen, and touching your people across the world. Thank you,
8:39
Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. So, today
8:45
on this I wanted to have a little celebration today. I am going to be sharing a little bit about my journey.
8:51
I'm going to be sharing things I have never I don't believe I've shared publicly before, a little behind the
8:56
scenes about this journey to reach 1 million subscribers on YouTube. And I
9:02
also am going to be answering some of your questions. I wrote on my social media pages just um just like an hour
9:09
ago asking if anyone had any questions. So, I'm going to be doing a little Q&A as well, and I'm also going to be
9:15
praying and praying for you all and releasing God's power through the screen. So, I can't wait for what God's
9:22
going to do today. Um, so I just wanted to share um first of all, there's Okay,
9:27
so I wanted to share about my journey to reach 1 million subscribers. I wanted to share you share one story that I don't
9:34
believe I have shared publicly. I don't think I have. Um so
9:41
so my spiritual father prophet Dr. Jord Davyy for those of you who are new
9:48
welcome by the way that I know there are um many who are new YouTube subscribers
9:54
as well. Um welcome. And it was so crazy you know I never even like knew how to
10:00
watch the live count um of subscribers until the day it reached 1 million. Jean
10:06
Tal like found out how to do it and that's the first time I I um I would
10:12
just refresh my YouTube page to see you know the the subscribers but that was really eye opening to see the live
10:19
subscriber count because it was like increasing constantly like sometimes one
10:26
every like second like one every second a new subscriber and it's just it just
10:33
opens up your eyes to see how many more people are coming stepping into God's
10:38
move into his revival and who may be encountering God's power for the very
10:44
first time. And so I just want to celebrate all of you who are new here. Welcome. Um I encourage you to uh check
10:54
out my story on my YouTube. You can find my testimony there on my journey playlist and also um I have a playlist
11:02
called revival army training and what this is is it's really um the foundation
11:11
foundational teaching of the new wine. Many many believers they have not
11:17
received new wine teaching. They have re received a lot of religious old wine
11:23
teaching. um where you remain lukewarm, where you
11:29
don't grow spiritually, you remain a baby. And a big thing that God is doing in this revival, revival is now, by the
11:37
way, if you are new here, God has brought revival. And um in his revival,
11:43
he has restored his power, his anointing. And we are seeing him do so many miracles, so much healing and
11:50
deliverance is taking place. People are receiving impartation of anointing. And they are walking in miracles too.
11:56
Leading others to freedom and healing by God's power and salvation. True salvation. True surrender. Not just
12:03
raising your hand saying it, repeat after me prayer, but true surrender because of real transformation and
12:10
really encountering God in power, really meeting Jesus like face to face rather
12:15
than just hearing a sermon about him. Um so uh God has restored his anointing but
12:24
he has also restored new wine revelation. uh it's not it's
12:30
not only like miracles and the the the power of God that he is restoring but
12:36
the deeper revelations of his kingdom that have been lost for so long and replaced by old wine religion like like
12:44
the doctrine that the Pharisees had and then Jesus had a really different doctrine. And it was new wine. Um void
12:52
of religion, void of um these old ways of how to get to God and and um how to
13:01
have, you know, how how to how to live as a as a believer of God. It was a very different way that Jesus brought. And
13:08
really, even though people preach Jesus in the churches all the time and they're preaching from the New Testament and
13:13
everything, by and large, it's missing revelation. And it's like preaching the New
13:19
Testament, preaching Jesus, but with the the Pharisees revelation. It would be
13:25
like if the Pharisees chose Jesus but kept their old wine. They chose to
13:31
follow Jesus, but they kept their old wine um doctrine. Uh but Jesus says you you
13:39
can't put old wine you can't put new wine into old wine skins. Meaning you can't mix them.
13:47
You have to shed your the old wine completely and get new wine skins to step you have to you have to step fully
13:53
into the new wine. You can't mix them. So um anyways my revival army training
13:58
playlist has so many foundational new wine teachings. So if you're new here, check that out on my YouTube channel.
14:04
There's so many different playlists that will help you too, like how to have a relationship with God, practical wisdom,
14:11
um uh uh relationships, a playlist about navigating relationships.
14:17
So, check out my YouTube channel for all of those different um playlists. Uh
14:23
yeah, so anyways, um for those of you that back to the story,
14:30
um I never wanted to be a minister. I never wanted to do what I'm doing now. I
14:35
wanted to be a singer and I was pursuing that when my now spiritual father
14:41
prophesied to me at an event at the time I went to an event and uh and my
14:47
spiritual father prophesied to me that I my now spiritual father prophesied to me. This is the first time I met him but at the time he prophesied that I was
14:54
called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ. I was called to reach the nations and he saw God doing many miracles through me
15:00
and I did not want that. I was like, "What? What about a prophecy about my music?" That's what I was thinking. But
15:07
the moment that I heard this shocking prophecy amidst that um those questions in my mind, I immediately was reminded
15:15
by God in that moment of the story of Moses. Moses um was called by God
15:20
through a burning bush. Like this shocking calling was released to him. You are called to be my mouthpiece of
15:26
millions of people. He's basically saying to Moses. So he's calling Moses to be a prophet to speak on behalf of
15:32
God um and to be a leader and of millions of people and Moses had a
15:39
stutter and Moses said to God but I have a stutter I can't even speak well like he's basically saying like I am the worst person possible worst candidate
15:46
for this job but God says he's basic God's basically says I've chosen you simply obey don't try to figure it out
15:53
in your mind God says I made your mouth I will give you the words to speak. And
16:00
um so really God was saying, "You just need to trust me and and and and and
16:05
I'll do the rest. I'll I'll give you all everything you need." Um and so I knew God was speaking that to me in that
16:11
moment. So I said yes to God cuz I wanted to be in God's will more than anything else. And I felt a deep
16:17
conviction um that I I needed to humble myself, be like Mary, be like a child,
16:23
childlike faith, and just say, "Yes, Lord, let it be done to me as you have said, for I am I am merely a servant of
16:30
the Lord." So that's what I did. I put music on the back burner, and I immediately followed God in this calling
16:37
of my life. And I started Five-fold Church um nine months after to the day
16:42
of receiving that prophecy. I did not plan that. I realized after the fact that the first time we ever had a church
16:48
service, it was a worship night. Um, it was nine months of the day after
16:54
receiving the prophecy. And um, and so we started small. The first year
17:02
we had about 20 people that came to our church. And the second year we decreased
17:08
down to about 15 people. And we decreased the next year down to five. the next year on to to and the next year
17:13
was co we went down to 20 I mean sorry two two people 2020 20 I mean we went
17:20
down to about two people lots of times most of a lot of the time which was Jeantal and myself and um and and other
17:29
times her her mom would be there um as well but uh
17:36
like back in like I'm trying to think of the exact year but Um
17:41
2017 I received oh 20 so 2016 I received the prophecy and then 2017
17:49
um prophet Jordan Davyy my spiritual father the same one who prophesied over my life also prophesied over America and
17:55
the world. God sent him to I hosted him at a conference in LA the next year and
18:01
God sent him he said that he prophesied that God sent him to America for this reason at that time and it was to
18:08
prophesy this that God has heard America's prayers for revival there has been so many prayers 24-hour prayer
18:15
sessions um pray prayer conferences for revival and God has heard these prayers
18:23
and he has answered them and he has sent revival now. It is no longer the time
18:29
for praying for revival. Revival is now.
18:34
And God is pouring out apostles and prophets that will be releasing this
18:39
revival, carrying this power of God to as leadership in this revival to equip
18:46
the body of Christ, to release impartation of anointing, to cast out demons, heal the sick, and to equip
18:52
others to do those works as well. And um I knew that God was uh uh
19:01
truly speaking this through the prophet. I I knew with all my heart. And so I knew that God was calling me to uphold
19:08
this word. So I kept um speaking again and again. Revival is now. Um and you
19:15
know we do we we we got smaller in number. It looked like the opposite. But I knew God was faithful. I knew he does
19:21
not lie. I knew that his promises will always come to pass. So, I just kept
19:26
believing. It was not always It was not easy. It was not easy. There were hard days for sure. There were days with
19:34
tears. Um but God remained good and I
19:39
chose to keep believing that he is good. He's never He's never proved himself to
19:46
me otherwise. He has proved nothing to me at that point that he is good and he
19:51
is faithful. So I kept believing that his promise would come to pass. I kept
19:57
believing that I could truly trust him with all of my heart. And um you know my spiritual father
20:04
prophesied in um he he he spoke to me. Uh this would have been about
20:13
one year or so after receiving the prophecy that revival is now. one year
20:18
or so he prophesied to me. He said, "I see the way that this revival is going to break out is is through one minute
20:24
videos." So God is calling you to put out one minute
20:31
videos and to keep going, keep going, keep going. Do not stop short like the
20:37
king stopped short when Elisha told him to strike the bow and he stopped short.
20:43
He only did it a couple times, but Elisha said, "If you have done would have done it five or six times, you have
20:49
you you would have defeated every army." So, um, and also he said the the the the
20:55
Israelites, they went around the walls of Jericho and they didn't stop short. And that is when they saw the walls of
21:00
Jericho come down because they kept going. Even if it didn't make sense, even if they're not seeing any progress,
21:07
they're just going around those walls, not seeing a brick fall down or anything. So this was a prophecy for my
21:13
spiritual father and I knew with all my heart that I had to obey that word of
21:19
God. And so I taught myself how to edit through iMovie. I only edited one video before. I taught myself how to edit
21:26
because no one else knew how to edit. I mean we didn't have a team. We had my team was like at that time was very very
21:33
tiny at the church and no one knew how to edit. So, um I spent so many hours
21:39
editing videos and this is where I began posting videos on all social media pages
21:44
including YouTube. And um at that time I had I don't know um
21:52
I don't even know the number of subscribers, but it was under 1,000. It was it was in the hundreds. It was in
21:59
the hundreds was my um am was the amount of sub subscribers that I had. Um, and I
22:05
just kept posting the videos. I would spend like maybe six, five to six at least hours editing a
22:12
sermon. So, in those years, I was spending so much time editing videos
22:19
that very few people would see, would like, would comment on. But it didn't
22:25
matter because all that mattered was obeying the word of God, was obeying what God had spoken that I must do. And
22:33
so um for years I I I I was obeying God,
22:39
doing these things, spending so many hours editing videos and it was for an audience of one. God was seeing me and
22:46
that really encouraged me that God only God saw me do it. But that was enough.
22:52
You know, it I grew closer to God in that time, more intimate with God because I was doing something that was
22:58
hard. It was hard because like I wasn't seeing fruit yet. I I just I just kept
23:04
um posting these videos and they weren't even increasing in views after years. Um and so that was hard to just be doing
23:12
it and it feeling like it's not we're not progressing. They're not really reaching people. Is what I'm doing
23:19
really blessing people? I am I don't know if I'm really good enough. I would have those thoughts all the time that
23:25
I'm not good enough. But I knew that I I shouldn't believe those words because God has called me to this. So, I I knew
23:33
he would use me. I I knew I I believed that, but I didn't feel that a lot of
23:38
the time, but I chose to believe the truth and reject the devil's lies. But I remember so many times just seeing God,
23:47
just knowing that he saw me and he was proud of me. And I grew in such intimacy
23:54
with God like never before during that time because it was just him seeing me. And and I and
24:03
I and I knew he I was touching his heart because I was doing something purely out of obedience. There wasn't anything
24:09
quite fun about it. And so I knew that that was touching God's heart. I sense that. I felt that. I could hear God say
24:17
that not in an audible voice but just renewing my mind to that truth that he
24:22
asked me to do this and he sees me and I'm doing it so he's pleased.
24:27
So um I'm grateful for that time. It humbled me, you know, just
24:34
doing something for years for an audience of one and no one really seeing
24:40
what I was doing and not getting any kind of applause or support for it, but
24:47
um just doing it anyway, truly doing it for Jesus. Amen. And so um
24:56
I kept posting those videos on all social media channels and in 2020 I got a Tik Tok account and I started a Tik
25:03
Tok account for the first time in 2020 actually and um the other social media
25:09
channel accounts I've had for years at this point but Tik Tok was new and I was reluctant to start it at first because
25:16
it was a lot to keep up with all of them. It was me posting them, editing and posting on in every single social
25:23
media account, every single one. So, I was reluctant, but I got an account,
25:28
this a Tik Tok account eventually, and I remember it was May 2020 and um it was
25:35
on Tik Tok that I experienced a video actually going somewhat viral. I don't
25:41
remember the exact amount of views, but it was in October and um I was ministering at Echo Park and this woman
25:47
was just touched by God in power. Like she just started when I prayed for her, she just started like kind of like not
25:54
falling to the ground but lowering herself to the ground cuz God's power came upon her. And that video went
26:01
semiviral like I don't know if it I think it reached past 100,000 views I
26:06
think eventually. But there was more followers that started coming. I don't know the exact number, but several
26:13
thousands. I don't think exactly 10,000 or so. But that was shocking cuz I'd
26:20
been posting videos for so long and I hadn't seen any kind of um any kind of like traction, any kind of really
26:27
increase for years. And looking back, I see that that was like the palm of the
26:33
hand, the the cloud, the size of the palm of the hand. When Elisha says, "I
26:39
see," he says to his servant, "I see a raincloud coming the size of the palm of of a hand. I see that. I see that now."
26:47
And he would keep looking his servant for the cloud. And he wouldn't see it until the seventh time. He saw a small
26:54
small and then a small cloud. And then that cloud increased to a big cloud and
27:00
brought a rainfall. And so looking back, that video was that small like like a
27:07
hint a foreshadowing what was to come. Um so that was in
27:14
October or no no that was um no November. I remember it was like the day before Thanksgiving cuz remember
27:20
Thanksgiving I was just so in awe seeing that video. Um how God just moved upon
27:27
it and started reaching more people for the first time. And then okay so fast forward to one month later I get this
27:34
vision of um of creating a video.
27:39
God just put this on my heart. this vision of showing montage a montage of
27:45
God moving in power that past year at Fivefold Church and in or orphans that I
27:50
prayed for in Tanzania. And um this this this video showed miracles and it showed also the power of
27:57
God touching people. And then I prayed for people at the end of it. And I posted this video on December 30th and
28:05
um a day and a half later it reached 1 million views. And that happened to be on my birthday, my 30th birthday,
28:12
January 1st of 2021. And on that video, I had thousands of
28:17
comments of people testifying of miracles they had received while watching the video. People testifying of
28:22
being healed, of having pain, it was now gone after watching, of having COVID symptoms, they were now gone after
28:28
watching. Of having anxiety, but they felt something leave them. Now they have peace. A couple different atheists
28:34
actually wrote, "I'm an atheist, but I felt power when I watched this video." Glory to God. This was one of the most
28:40
shocking days of my life. I will never forget ever ever. I'm one of the days
28:45
I've been the most shocked in my entire life. These are the most shocked days of my life was um receiving the prophecy
28:52
over my life. Then um uh uh uh the day that God really spoke that it was it was
28:59
God's will for my spiritual father to be my spiritual father, for Prophet David to be my spiritual father. That was one of the most shocking, joyous days of my
29:05
life. Um and then uh this would have been the
29:12
next most shocking day of my life. Just in awe of Jesus, the a struck with
29:19
Jesus's love and power and faithfulness. And um that video led to an immediate
29:28
following on Tik Tok, a big following. I started going live every week. People were wa people would be receive miracles
29:34
as they watched. all of a sudden that never happened before. Only one miracle on one live that I did that was in
29:39
October. So this is the first time besides that um that many miracles are
29:46
taking place on the live streams and it happened on every live stream. And so revival started breaking out online. A
29:52
couple months later a woman was um a woman traveled from Nashville, Tennessee
29:58
and came to our service in the park because we were having services in the park because of COVID. couldn't we
30:03
couldn't run our building anymore and um demons started speaking out of her and
30:08
by God's grace and power um I cast out a demon by God's power Jesus delivered her
30:15
and the video of that went very viral and that led to a couple months later we
30:21
grew to 300 from 20some people in the park to 300 and people were being delivered everywhere it was revival
30:29
beyond what I'd ever imagined and dreamed D um that day, May 30th, 2021.
30:35
And ever since then, it's just increased. Ever since then, ever since that summer, people have traveled from
30:40
different nations and around the US to come to 5F Church and encounter God's power. And we've had so many events.
30:48
I've ministered in 18 nations where we've seen God deliver and heal and touch and release imitation to thousands
30:56
of people. And um I've gone live most
31:01
most every week most every week. Um since then since before then since
31:09
before then on YouTube on Facebook on Instagram on Tik Tok and um on every
31:15
single live there have been testimonies of people receiving miracles. that never stopped since that since I started going
31:22
live um January 2021 and God's just moved in power and so many testimonies
31:29
would pour in in the comments. It's never stopped since then. Revival truly came. Revival is here and revival has
31:38
kept growing ever since. Praise God. Glory to God. Um well that was a really
31:44
long recap of my story that I know a lot of you already know but I wanted to share a little background
31:50
while while so I can now share this part um which is what I haven't shared before I don't think at least I don't remember
31:58
um so this ever since Scott started moving in
32:04
power and things are going viral the devil was not happy. The devil, the
32:11
devil really tried to stop this move of God. He's tried to hold back this move of God. He tried to um deceive people.
32:19
He tried to spew so many lies, false accusations, nonsense uh to try to keep people from
32:27
coming and receiving the power of God and stepping into revival. But the devil
32:33
has lost every single time. And he will continue to be defeated. Anytime he tries to stop what God is doing, to stop
32:41
people from receiving Jesus and his power, he will be defeated every time.
32:47
Hallelujah. I've seen Jesus in my life in this revival. He has a perfect track
32:54
record of victory. It's perfect. And I'm 100% confident that my Jesus will
32:59
continue being victorious for his move for his people, for his will to be done.
33:06
Amen. Hallelujah. So, one of the I want to just share this
33:12
this opposition that happened. Um, so my Tik Tok account, God used my Tik Tok.
33:18
So, it was wild. This is such a weak and foolish thing because I had been putting out videos on all these different social
33:25
media channels, pages, including YouTube for years. But then all of a sudden 2020
33:31
hit and I started Tik Tok. And God used Tik Tok to open up this door for revival
33:39
to break out. That was the door that opened. That was the door that that that
33:45
these videos started going viral and circulating so much in a short time that just two months later
33:53
two months after that video went viral this woman comes and and another woman comes and their friends come from
33:59
Nashville. People travel from Nashville in Massachusetts just to come to my church our church service Fifold Church
34:04
in the park and that was where the first deliverance took place at Fifold Church.
34:10
It was a first deliverance. Um, so God used Tik Tok to open up that door.
34:17
And um, that Tik Tok account just kept growing shockingly fast. I was literally
34:25
so shocked at how fast that Tik Tok account grew. It grew to 1.3
34:33
million and I forget the exact amount of time but it was around a little more
34:40
than one year. Not since having the Yeah, bas almost
34:45
since having the Tik Tok account, but like a little more than a year it grew
34:50
to 1.3 million. Um, no, no, not not not since having the Tik Tok account, but I mean since having
34:57
like at least 1,000 followers at least since having at least 10,000 followers.
35:02
So, from like 1,000 followers to 1.3 million. That was a little more than a
35:07
year. Like a year and a few months or so. That was so shocking. I was I did
35:13
not expect that. I was so blown away at how fast it grew. Glory to God. Just so
35:20
many videos would just go viral, go viral, go viral, go viral, go viral. God opened up such tremendous doors to make
35:27
this revival spread so fast through Tik Tok. And obviously the devil was very
35:32
angry at this door. He was very angry um
35:38
how fast it was growing, how the videos were going so viral on Tik Tok. So um
35:45
then opposition came on towards my Tik Tok channel. So,
35:50
it was like early 2020. Early when was it? Ear I'm trying to
35:57
think of the exact dates. Oh, early 2022. Um, I want to say it was Yeah, that it
36:03
was I think February. So, that I got a notification that my Tik Tok account was taken down and I appealed it because the
36:11
reasons didn't really make sense. I think they were saying that some videos were going against their um guideline or
36:16
their standards or something but they weren't and so I appealed it and they
36:22
said we we are sorry they actually Tik Tok actually um apologized
36:27
um through the email and and said we have restored your account now and I
36:33
think it will I don't know the exact time I want to say like one to twoish months maybe three but around then later
36:41
shortly after that, after it was reinstated, it got taken down again. Um,
36:48
and this time the reason they gave was not that any videos I put out were going
36:55
against theirs their standards, their guidelines or whatever, but this time the reasoning was that I was under 13
37:02
years old. Now, actually quite funny because I was
37:09
31. Yeah, 31 at that time. And so I appealed it through the email
37:17
and they said, you know, to appeal this you need to show your driver's license. So I sent my driver's license, a picture
37:22
of it and I explained to them I'm not 13. So obviously someone had um
37:28
maliciously, you know, reported that or something and just the robotic system, I
37:34
guess, just automatically took it down or something. So, um, yeah. So, I sent
37:41
the the driver's license picture in, but there was no response. And we kept
37:47
emailing. We kept doing everything we could, researching how to talk to an actual person. At Tik Tok, we tried and
37:55
we tried and we tried and we tried. We tried so much. We tried for a long time,
38:01
probably like more than a year. Um, and uh, you know, when I didn't see that
38:08
door opening at the time for that account to be reinstated,
38:14
I knew I had this knowing that the devil can't do that, you know, like
38:21
he can't he can't he can't do that, you know? It's it's unjust. It's not fair.
38:27
He can't do that. So he can't get away with it in one way or
38:32
another. He can't get away with it. It may not be that that exact account is
38:39
immediately reinstated, but God can move in different ways and open up different
38:45
doors to bring justice to
38:51
open doors to reach all of those people that could no longer be reached through
38:56
that channel, through that avenue. Um, and so I've been believing in God
39:04
for that ever since ever since early 2022,
39:10
you know. Um, and I've just been resting in him. And that is one of the special
39:16
parts of this moment, this milestone of 1 million subscribers on YouTube because
39:22
it's a moment where God has restored. And um it really reminds me so much of
39:29
the story of Job. Not to compare like suffering of that to Job suffering. I
39:35
don't mean that. But like just the principle of you know the principle of
39:43
God giving and taking away not taking away in a mean way but allowing a
39:49
takeaway for your good. Um God it was God who gave all those
39:57
blessings to Job that he had. Job was so blessed. Job was so blessed with his
40:02
family. He was so blessed with financially. He was so blessed with his health. He He was just blessed all
40:09
around in every way. I mean, but it was truly God who blessed him. Job was a
40:15
righteous man. Job loved God and was faithful to God. And
40:21
even God says that to the devil. He says, "Have you seen Job?" He's actually the one that that like brings it up.
40:26
Have you seen how I forget the exact words right now that God uses, but he's
40:31
basically saying like, "Have you seen how faithful he is? how much how how wonderful a man of God he is
40:39
and that gets the devil's attention and the devil decide well he's like devil's
40:46
like oh he only is so such a wonderful man of God because you bless him so much but if he didn't have all those
40:52
blessings he wouldn't be so faithful to you and worship you so much um and the
40:59
devil's like how about you can you allow me God to to to test this theory that I
41:04
have, do will you allow me to take some things away from from Job? And God
41:10
actually agrees to it, but he says, you can't touch his spirit. You can't touch his life, his actual life. You can't
41:16
kill him. You can't touch his spirit, but you can take away his possessions, his health, even his family. God
41:24
actually allows that. But he, you know, God allowed this for a purpose. He wanted to bring an even greater blessing
41:30
to Job through this as a reward. He wanted to bring a refining fire to Job
41:35
so that Job could be transformed even more to be
41:41
an even better vessel of God to do more for God. And one of the most important
41:47
things is that he wanted to make an example of Job for us today. He wanted
41:53
he wanted Job to be a faith hero, someone that we could look up to to see
41:58
that as an example that we should keep keep trusting God and and never let our
42:07
faith to to leave us, but to keep believing that God is good even when things don't make sense. even in
42:14
valleys, even when things are not going well, like it feels like things are being
42:19
taken away or something like or you're going backwards, but that you would never you would never do anything but
42:27
continue to worship God through that. continue to trust God. Humble yourself and be childlike.
42:33
Um a and trust that he's allowing this for a purpose and it's just temporary
42:39
and there will be a reward and an increase for going through this and he's
42:45
just faithful and that's it. Period. You just have to trust him. So that's a beautiful story that the story of Job
42:52
gives us. Um, and so when I look at the story of Job, I look
42:57
at God's heart for for me, for you, for all of us today. how like God wanted to
43:03
build this story of faith, this story that exemplifies the faithfulness of God
43:09
that shows us how to be faithful to God and how to continue to worship him
43:15
through the storms and trust him when things don't make sense and that we can
43:20
we can still worship him and and and trust him in the lowest of lows, you
43:27
know. So, um, yeah, but God, you know, took away from Job, allowed the devil to
43:34
take away. But you know what? God restored after that time of testing
43:40
passed, it was temporary. It had to come to an end. And when that passed, God
43:47
restored to Job double. So much more was given back, was
43:53
given to him. He was blessed. He ended up being more blessed than than he was before.
44:00
So um you know also this is a test of humility. So I when I when I saw that
44:08
happening and I saw that God was just choosing at that time to not like open
44:13
up that door, I saw okay this is a moment for me to become more humble. Um,
44:21
this is a refining fire moment. You know, you know these just like Job, all
44:27
that he was blessed with, it was all because of God. And so those blessings
44:33
like didn't belong to Job. It was just gifts like like there shouldn't be
44:38
entitlement, you know, and and and so I shouldn't I shouldn't be entitled of um
44:45
my TikTok account, you know. I shouldn't I shouldn't feel like how dare the devil
44:52
do that to me, you know, like this is God's like this is 100% God who has done
44:58
this and this this is this is just for me to steward, but this isn't something
45:04
that like belongs to me. This is something this isn't something that I should like get angry in my heart that
45:11
some that the devil has taken this from me or something like that. And most importantly, my identity shouldn't be in
45:18
that. I shouldn't have um like pride in that. I shouldn't um like feel special
45:24
and important because of that. And you know, Tik Tok at that time with 1.3
45:31
million followers, it had way more f I had way more followers on that account than every other um social media page at
45:40
that time. I think all the other social media pages was like YouTube at the time
45:45
was like 100k 100k and Instagram was 100 somethingk
45:52
and Facebook was I don't know maybe 200k or something like that um so Tik Tok was
45:59
way way way way way above so that for me was a test of humility and um I thank
46:06
God for refining me and helping me get through that and not be too bothered.
46:13
You know, first of all, when that account went down, I just went into
46:19
faith mode like this is unjust. God will restore it. I don't need to get down
46:25
about it. I know that God doesn't want me to get down about it. I know that would be disobedience to God to not trust him if I allow myself to get down
46:34
about it. So, that was the big thing was just faith. faith is what kept me kept
46:41
where I could keep my choosing faith is what helped me keep my peace, helped me not get down, helped me not be distracted and annoyed by it or
46:47
something. But then like secondly was I mean the second thing that helped me like not be so bothered that the account
46:55
was taken down was um that God was God was doing so many amazing
47:02
things. I mean, it was at a time where I went through the the the the most severe
47:08
p persecution I'd ever gone through yet. And it was so intense. It was so difficult that it was like it was like a
47:15
couple months after that. And so it was still happening actually. It was a season of like
47:21
deep persecution. I didn't imagine like the the kinds of false accusations and people coming against me, sisters and
47:27
brothers in Christ, ministers coming against me, speaking against me, making up lies. Um I never expected to go
47:33
through something like that even though I knew persecution was coming but I it was just like whiplash. Um but even
47:40
through that I remember at that same time like the fir God opened up the door
47:46
for my first international trip to minister and first international event
47:51
to minister in. It was January
47:56
2022 and um up to that point I had been ministering every single week around the
48:02
US besides like one or two weeks maybe like Christmas week or something. It was like literally every week. Sometimes it
48:08
was four, one time it was like four cities in one week and that was crazy because that involved
48:14
a like fivehour delay
48:19
and I ended up being like two hours late to the event but people stayed and didn't leave and got moved powerfully
48:25
that was in like Philly area but anyways um
48:31
I was ministering every single week in a different city in the US and then when
48:36
2022 hit the first week, God opened up a door for me to minister in a in a different nation outside of America for
48:42
the first time. And the first nation was Tanzania, East Africa. And guess where
48:48
my spiritual father is from? Tanzania, East Africa. And I had gone to Tanzania, East Africa many times. I don't know the
48:55
exact amount of times I up to that point, but several times I went to visit my spiritual father's church to receive
49:02
impartation to just be equipped just to soak in the anointing and to grow
49:08
spiritually to go to that to the well. I had already gone so many times and um
49:15
the first door out of all the nations in the world there's like a hund I forget the exact number 190 something I think
49:21
nations the first nation was Tanzania and these the the hosts did not even
49:28
know my spiritual father they were from an Asian country and God called them to
49:35
be missionaries and started a church that ministered to the Hindu people living in Tanzania like it was not even
49:42
connected to my spiritual father. So this is just a side note wow Jesus moment. It was so shocking that the very
49:49
first nation God opened that door to was Tanzania. It was just like God was first of all just like honoring
49:56
honoring where I received impartation of anointing where this prophecy came from of this revival breaking out all over
50:03
the world through my spiritual father prophet Javi in Tanzania. God was honoring him, honoring him, honoring that nation. And it felt like a hug and
50:12
a wink from God to me as well. Um, so then the next nation I ministered in was
50:18
the Netherlands. And um, I remember I think it was in the Netherlands where I found out that the Tik Tok account was
50:24
taken down the first time. And I remember just being the first time I I just I knew God would restore. I
50:30
believed God would restore it. And I was just so busy ministering in the Netherlands. It was like multiple day event. And it was my first nation
50:36
outside of Tanzania, first European nation, first really big event. I think like,200 people came and I was too busy
50:44
with the work of God and being in awe of the promises of God
50:50
being fulfilled that I couldn't be that bothered. I I I couldn't be bothered by
50:55
that Tik Tok account being taken down. And the same thing was true a few months later. I I was ministering every single
51:02
week except for a couple weeks that first year and a half. a few weeks that first year and a half many times in different nations. So I was so busy with
51:08
the work of God. I was so busy just being in awe of God and how he was
51:13
touching people so powerfully, delivering so many all the testimonies that I couldn't be bothered by that Tik
51:21
Tok account being taken down the second time. And I remember that I was never really that bothered just because I
51:27
chose to keep believing God. And also because I kept my eyes on uh the all the
51:34
good that God was doing as it says in the Bible, whatever is lovely, admirable, worthy of praise.
51:41
Think of such things. Think of such things. So I kept my mind there. And so
51:47
I want to just share with you today this lesson like well first of all God
51:53
doesn't need Tik Tok. It's it's it's powerful because it's like God opened up that door. He used Tik Tok but he never
51:59
needed Tik Tok for this revival to break out. There's something that God has really been speaking and I even shared it last
52:06
week because God has really been speaking this to me a lot lately and it's I mean it's really just been revealed to me just a deep revelation
52:13
about all the doors that God has available to use to open for his people
52:19
for his move. Like if God needs a person or a social
52:24
media thing or a vehicle, if God needs a vehicle or a person to open up a door
52:31
for something for you, for his revival, he has a lot to choose from first of all
52:38
and um he is the creator of the universe. He is God and he is the one
52:44
who is in control. So, um, like he, you
52:49
know, if if he he doesn't have he's not confined to just one way. And that's
52:56
something so powerful that God has revealed to me is like
53:01
to not rely on one thing, one person,
53:06
one way, one avenue of reaching the promised land. Because first of all, you
53:13
don't know what God is going to use. So don't like put all those eggs in one basket. Like don't like just be open and
53:20
be ready to go wherever God sends you. You know, I did not I did not plan on
53:26
starting a Tik Tok account. I did not plan on it. I was moved one day that
53:31
like, you know, pe God's people are in all these different places. is God's
53:37
people are on YouTube, on Facebook, on Instagram, on Tik Tok, on X. They're all these different places. And so you're
53:45
we're called to go into the ends of the earth. We're called to make disciples of the nations. And this is where the nations are. This is where the people
53:52
are located. I mean, this is one of the biggest ways you can reach the people to the ends of the earth. So that God
53:59
really impressed that on my heart one day in May 2020 that I I really if I am
54:04
not using this tool to reach people then there's some people that are that are being missed. So I didn't plan on this
54:10
but I never in a million years could have imagined God was going to use Tik Tok to open up that door uh that made
54:17
revival break out everywhere. But looking back, it's so beautiful like it's kind of it it it's beautiful like
54:25
just how God reveals how he it's not Tik Tok that made this happen. It's God, you
54:32
know, like he does it doesn't need Tik Tok. Okay. Okay. Devil, you want to take Tik Tok down? Okay, Pharisees, you want
54:38
to come with your schemes in whatever ways in um whatever ways you want to come to try to tear down this revival.
54:45
You try to close a door somewhere. Okay, maybe God will allow it will allow you to do that. He will you have free will.
54:52
God will allow you. He will only allow you because he's going to use it for good. He's going to use as refining fire
54:58
and because he has he doesn't need that door. He has other doors he can open.
55:04
And so um I I just now here we are
55:09
YouTube and God has brought this restoration and it's just shown like he
55:15
didn't need Tik Tok. he can also use YouTube. He also doesn't need YouTube. He can use other things. He doesn't need
55:21
this person to open up this door. He can use a different person, you know. And um
55:27
it's it's just so beautiful. Even how revival broke out has broken out so much. It's the the the biggest way
55:33
revival has broken out has not been from a person
55:39
using their influence to draw people to revival to what God's
55:47
doing. But it's been it's been through social media. It's like it doesn't it's
55:53
beautiful. It's like God is saying like I don't need a certain person to open up
55:59
a door even like I can move in this way if people want to be stubborn, if people
56:04
want to be prideful, if people want to be jealous, if people don't want to um
56:10
come in alignment with my move. I I don't have to depend on them. I'm
56:16
I'm God. Like God God's saying this like I can move in different ways. I can move through social media. I can breathe upon
56:24
viral videos and I can I can get my power into the eyes of people who truly
56:32
want me. God's saying I can get my video the my my power in
56:39
front of people who actually want me. And I I like God is God. He can do that.
56:46
And nobody can stop that. Nobody can hold back God from reaching his people,
56:52
from coming and doing a new thing that people will reject, some people won't
56:59
like, some people call demonic, just like in the times of Jesus, nothing can stop. When God's plans, when God wants
57:07
to do something, he will do it. When he wanted to deliver the Israelites out of Egypt, he did it. It did not matter that
57:14
the person with such a hard heart you can't even dream about and he has all of
57:19
these powers did not matter. He said no and no and no and no and no again. It
57:26
did not matter. God split the sea. Hallelujah. So he will continue
57:32
splitting the seas. Splitting the seas through social media. Splitting the seas through other ways of media. Splitting
57:38
the seas with other people who will say yes to him. unexpected people that people will never expect, but he will
57:45
use them to split the sea for his revival. Hallelujah.
57:51
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Praise
57:57
God. I have to verify on TikTok here.
58:16
messed up my Tik Tok phone there. Speaking of Tik Tok, I love all of you on Tik Tok. Welcome. This is my new Tik
58:21
Tok account, by the way, which I'm believing God is going to restore still in Jesus name. God can God will still do
58:28
it. I believe in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Praise God. Um, thank you, Jesus. So, I
58:34
just wanted to share that story and share, you know, not only is this such a wonderful milestone, but this is also a
58:41
testimony of the restoration of God. It's a testimony um of how God gives
58:48
back what the enemy stole and how the devil has to pay. The devil is not
58:54
allowed to hold back what God has planned to release to his people. The
59:01
devil can never do that. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
59:16
Um and I also wanted to share something um another another thing I wanted to
59:22
share about this journey is um on YouTube you know it's it's very
59:28
interesting with social media because like the way the algorithms work it just can dep
59:36
it's different and I've learned this even recently it can just depend on the year it can depend and how those how
59:42
these algorithms work, you know, and so sometimes like videos can go viral more easily. It's just in a certain season.
59:51
So I remember on my my YouTube channel for the past for like two years from
59:56
like for like the year 2024, the year 2023, like I want to say like those two years,
1:00:04
my YouTube channel grew so shockingly fast. like Tik Tok. Looking back now,
1:00:10
wow, actually this just revelation is just coming right now. Praise God. Wow, that's so powerful.
1:00:16
Looking back, it wasn't too long after that Tik Tok account was taken down that God brought this supernatural speed
1:00:23
similar to Tik Tok. Wow. Glory to God. Because I remember it wasn't growing
1:00:30
that fast. I mean, still fast, but like not like um like how it did a couple for
1:00:36
a couple years like like that first year. But I want to say like 2022 and 2023 I want to say I don't know the
1:00:43
exact times but I'm just saying like generally about those or no sorry 2023
1:00:48
2024 about 2023 and 2024 I want to say it was about 1 to 2,000 new follow new
1:00:56
subscribers every single day either one or two like nonstop for like 2 years and
1:01:02
that was really shocking because for a couple years before that it was not that way at all and it was just one day.
1:01:09
That's just how it was. Glory to God. God was really breathing on it. And then
1:01:14
once it reach so so so it grew from 100 thou or I mean I I forget the exact
1:01:20
numbers. I didn't come prepared right now to to remember all the exact numbers but I want to say like probably like
1:01:26
300,000 to 900,000. That growth probably happened within like 2 years or so something like that.
1:01:34
Very quick amount of time. And then in the about one year ago, I think it was se I think it was like
1:01:39
Septemberish of last year, um my YouTube channel hit 900,000 subscribers. And
1:01:46
when it hit 900 subscri I think when it hit 900,000 subscribers, it was at that time where it was growing so fast, 1 to
1:01:52
2,000 every single day. And then all of a sudden, I want to say like early this
1:01:57
year, uh there was great opposition upon the channel's growth.
1:02:06
uh you know just it was very different all of a sudden as opposed to what it was two years ago. So that last 100,000
1:02:13
it was it was a slower growth than what it was before that. And um that was even
1:02:21
that was another refining fire for me to just we were so close. It felt like we were so close. Oh, this is so exciting.
1:02:26
And also this this restoration of what was lost before. But it was just a test
1:02:32
in being content and content in God's timing. And just also one one big thing
1:02:38
that God has taught me all through these years is like we get so focused on the
1:02:44
finish line. We get so focused on the promised land. We get so focused for those mountaintop moments, those big
1:02:49
exciting moments that your your goal. You get so focused on the goal, the dream, the prophecy coming to pass that
1:02:58
you can really disvalue the present moment, the the power of the present
1:03:04
moment, the fact that the present moment is building to that dream. So, it's it's
1:03:09
it's just as important as that the dream coming to pass is what you're doing now.
1:03:17
the fact that you're giving your all to Jesus. You are you are giving your all every day. You're putting your whole
1:03:24
heart into what you're doing just for the fact of serving Jesus. You know, not for the fact of reaching something
1:03:32
exciting and getting the dream to come true, but just purely for the sake of
1:03:38
serving Jesus. You are putting your all into what God is calling you to do each
1:03:43
day. And so um this you know on on
1:03:48
YouTube on all the social media channels but I know as we're talking specifically about YouTube today on you know I would
1:03:54
I would go live I would go live like
1:04:00
well with my Instagram or subscriber Q&A it's like twice a week pretty much like twice a week um every week. And if I
1:04:09
wasn't going live I was going live in a different way with revival events. Um, and then Sunday services on top of that.
1:04:16
So, it was the only times I didn't was if I couldn't, like my parents were in town visiting for Christmas, things like
1:04:23
that. Um, but it's the only time I've like ever even taken
1:04:30
off a week of going live um, while being
1:04:35
home, like not traveling somewhere. Like on my birthday, I went somewhere. So, I got I rest and took took off, went on
1:04:42
vacation. Um but like the only time I've not gone live like while being at home
1:04:47
is like when I have moved in the past. So it has been year after year, week
1:04:53
after week of of showing up and
1:04:59
ministering and feeding God's people and doing what God has asked me to do and doing it with all my heart even if I
1:05:04
didn't feel like it. Naturally, like when you whenever you do something, it's going to naturally there's going to be
1:05:10
sometimes you don't feel like doing it. Naturally, you feel tired. Naturally, maybe you're fighting a cold. Naturally,
1:05:16
um something came up that day that was really difficult that you had to go through or or maybe you're just you're
1:05:23
just not feeling it. You're just sometimes like the Lord I I wasn't sure what I was going to preach on yet and
1:05:30
God hadn't revealed it to me and he wouldn't reveal it to me till like almost right away. And that's that's
1:05:35
very uncomfortable. I mean, right before we started the live, that's very uncomfortable, you know. Um, but God had
1:05:41
called me to keep showing up because it's all about his people, about feeding his people. And um what I found is like
1:05:48
when you're serving God, everything you're doing for him that he's calling you to do is for his people is to help
1:05:56
his people, is to bless his people, is to equip his people, is to um release
1:06:02
healing, release freedom, release his love. So that is the most beautiful thing in the world. That's the most
1:06:07
beautiful thing in the world. So whenever I am going live, whenever I'm doing the work
1:06:14
of God, I am doing the most precious thing in the world, the most beautiful thing in the world. And so that is so
1:06:22
valuable. That is so precious. That is so beautiful. That is so lifechanging mo
1:06:27
mountain moving every single day. Hallelujah.
1:06:34
Every single time. And so this is something that God has really taught me is like it it don't look at the end goal
1:06:41
so much that you forget the beauty, the value, the importance
1:06:47
of what you're doing every day. Um this is is the most important thing.
1:06:54
This and this is what leads to promises being fulfilled. You know, serving God
1:07:01
is so beautiful and is so fulfilling when you can see it for what it is. When you can see that it's the most important
1:07:09
thing in the world, what you're doing. Being a vessel of God, being a vessel of God where God can help
1:07:16
people, feed people, equip people, heal people, deliver people.
1:07:22
There is nothing more fulfilling. There's nothing more purposeful. There's nothing more beautiful than that. in the
1:07:28
whole wide world. Hallelujah. Amen. One last thing I want to add and this has to
1:07:34
do with it just came to my mind right now. I I have to mention it. So um going back to I knew there was one thing I was
1:07:41
forgetting going back to um how there was opposition about the past
1:07:49
year into getting to with on my YouTube channel there was opposition. Um, so
1:07:56
the Lord led me to preach this message that I preached this past Sunday. And
1:08:02
this message was a, if you didn't see it, make sure you go back and watch it. I believe it will be lifechanging.
1:08:08
And the things that you're asking God for, you will start seeing them come to pass. Now, I believe when after watching
1:08:15
this message, because I revealed this I revealed this key of faith and how to actually have faith and and just
1:08:21
releasing revelation. I released revelation of God released re revelation of how powerful your faith is like how
1:08:31
it literally does move mountains when you actually have faith and steward faith and and even more powerful when we
1:08:39
unite together in faith when we believe in something together.
1:08:44
So, um the Lord actually led me to preach this um two Sundays ago, but then
1:08:51
God, um well, I was I was preparing that message for two Sundays ago, but then
1:08:56
the Lord led us to go to the beach spontaneously um that Sunday for
1:09:02
service. So then God led me to um preach that message I had prepared for that
1:09:07
Sunday originally for this Sunday. Okay. And so um this was not planned by me at
1:09:14
the on Sunday to declare mountains to move. That was not prepared at all. This
1:09:20
was completely Holy Spirit. At the end of the message, the Holy Spirit led me to declare every mountain that was
1:09:28
blocking God's people from receiving him, from receiving his power, from receiving this revival to move. So I
1:09:36
declared these mountains to move. I declared all these mountains holding back people from receiving God and his
1:09:42
revival to move. And everyone at church and everyone watching live I know was
1:09:47
standing in faith together. And it was so powerful. It was one of the most powerful experience I've ever I've ever had. The unity, the unity in faith and
1:09:56
the the the the the passion in the hearts, the passionate faith, the the
1:10:01
the the uni the unity of the congregation, of the revival army, of
1:10:07
just all of us together, desiring this with all of our hearts and believing in all of our hearts that God would remove
1:10:15
these mountains that were hindering God's people from receiving him and hindering revival, from spreading all
1:10:22
the places that it hasn't spread yet. It was so powerful. Wow. Um, so yeah, I did
1:10:30
not plan that. And the day before I knew my YouTube channel would was going to reach 1 million either Sunday or Monday.
1:10:36
I was guessing. I was guessing based on like how it is growing that it would be Sunday or Monday. But when I when I am
1:10:42
in church mode, I am in church mode. I am not thinking about anything else. I'm not thinking about the YouTube. I'm I
1:10:48
mean the the the 1 million subscribers that it's reaching. I'm thinking about completely church. So, um, so yeah. So,
1:10:57
it was so powerful and so prophetic that we all declared, united together for the
1:11:04
mountains that were hindering God's people, people from receiving him and his revival to be moved. And then
1:11:11
literally, it actually started moving really fast after that where I missed it even reaching the million exactly the
1:11:18
moment because it started moving really fast. And so it happened just a few hours after the church service on Sunday
1:11:24
after um I I declared the mountain to move and we all stood united together.
1:11:31
The mountains holding people back from receiving. So that was powerful. Thank you Jesus. Glory to God. And it is so
1:11:38
prophetic of what we are about to see God do in this year of acceptance that we are in. And there's four months left.
1:11:46
And I'm so expectant and excited more than ever ever before for these doors
1:11:52
that God will open. These doors that are unexpected. These doors that the devil
1:11:58
can't stop that no man can shut. that God will open up just like he did
1:12:06
through Tik Tok, just like he did through YouTube and all these other
1:12:11
social media ways and through other people who have opened up doors by um
1:12:16
hosting events and um sharing this revival with others. Many of you God has
1:12:22
used as open doors. Um many of you are the biggest open doors actually that God
1:12:28
has used you know because it was you think about the 12 disciples they didn't have any
1:12:36
endorsements the the religious leaders of that time were doing the opposite of endorsing
1:12:43
them. Those 12 disciples um
1:12:48
they changed the world because of their faith. Um, we see the Samaritan woman at the well and many others testifying of
1:12:55
what Jesus had done. And God used those open doors through those people to
1:13:01
spread the good news that has led to
1:13:06
I don't even know how many, but so many believers have come into the kingdom today
1:13:13
when there was not, you know, anyone endorsing them, supporting them. um that
1:13:20
h people of power, people of um religious power and what have you. So
1:13:26
God has used many of you as open doors for his revival to spread across the world. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
1:13:34
God.
1:13:42
So um I want to just answer a couple of your questions right now that you had that you that you wrote. Um, okay.
1:13:52
Let's see. Okay, here's a good one. Day uh that one day. Okay, there was that day that one person left the park on the
1:13:58
hot day. Okay, this is appropriate because we're in a heat we've been in a heat wave right now in LA. I think today
1:14:03
actually got it wasn't as hot, but it's been very hot in LA and it tends to get
1:14:09
this way this time of year. September, it was September. It was 100 something degrees and we had church still and um
1:14:15
it was just Shantel and I and Marissa who shared her testimony on Sunday and there was one person that was that came
1:14:22
to the service and I preached to them and in the middle of the message they left and so then I then turned to the
1:14:28
live stream which there was there was zero to 10 people watching. I don't know the amount but it was usually that
1:14:35
amount 0 to 10ish or so people that would watch. Um, and I just kept preaching and I didn't stop. And um,
1:14:43
Shantel and Marissa were there receiving and serving. And um,
1:14:49
yeah. So here this here's this question that day. What did Prophet Jord Davies say to encourage you, my spiritual
1:14:55
father? I don't remember exactly that day, but what I what I will say is like
1:15:00
um that day was hard, but there had been a lot of other days where there was just one person there or two people there.
1:15:09
So, it wasn't like completely devastating. It's like I was used to it.
1:15:15
Um, I was used to just obeying God and
1:15:20
being okay with whatever happened, however many people
1:15:26
came, but all I know is I have to obey God and that's all that matters. Nothing else matters.
1:15:32
I was used to that, you know, and we decreased in size from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 to two. So,
1:15:38
the one thing that's so powerful about like this process of going through things for years, like going through
1:15:44
hard things for years, is that it changes you. When you choose to keep on obeying God, you keep showing up no
1:15:50
matter what. When it's hard, that changes you. Like that's the fruit
1:15:56
of doing that, of obeying God, of persevering. The fruit is that you become changed. So,
1:16:04
the servant heart gets formed in you. I love how Mary says, "Let it be done to me." When when when the angel says,
1:16:12
"You you you will conceive by the Holy Spirit. The the Holy Spirit will come upon you. You will conceive. You will give birth to the Savior of the world."
1:16:19
When when when the angel delivers that news to Mary, she says, "Let it be done to me as you have said, for I am a
1:16:25
servant of the Lord." This is one of my one of the one of my favorite verses in
1:16:31
scripture because it just so perfectly like shows
1:16:36
us our role, our job, our calling is simply to be a servant of the Lord. God's going to tell us to do crazy
1:16:42
things, weird things, strange things we don't understand, hard things, things that aren't fun, but we are simply
1:16:48
servants of God. And we we must obey. Like we must just simply be childlike.
1:16:55
Don't overthink it. Don't question it. Don't bring too much logic into it. Don't be prideful. Humble yourself and
1:17:04
just do what God's asking you to do. So that is what I did day after day after day. And it changed me. It changed me to
1:17:13
to be this servant of God. Like whatever whatever God is asking me to do, okay.
1:17:19
You know, whatever the outcome, okay. However long it takes, okay,
1:17:26
I'm simply a servant of God. So, I remember that day it being really hard, being really difficult, but thanks to
1:17:32
the Lord's strength and thanks to my spiritual father's continual encouragement and his example of
1:17:38
strength, he never babyed me. He always just had so much strength. Like, if I would tell him stuff like that, if I
1:17:43
would tell him something like that, he wasn't like, "Oh, my poor spiritual daughter, that's really hard." No, it
1:17:51
was the contrary, you know, because and it was so beautiful looking back because it's like he exemplified such faith in
1:17:58
God, such trust in God and such humility like
1:18:03
that we wouldn't be entitled, you know, that I shouldn't be entitled or you know, oh, one person came and they left.
1:18:10
That's okay. Like this is what God did today, okay? This is what it's fine. Like it doesn't change the fact that the
1:18:15
promise will come to pass. It doesn't change the fact that revival is going to break out. It's going to happen. And this was just today's um day as a
1:18:22
servant of God. And it was a beautiful day and the work of God went forth and
1:18:29
you were blessed and you were healthy and God is good. Amen. And so I know
1:18:34
that I shared that with him. Um I don't remember exactly, but I know that at that point by the grace of God and the
1:18:42
example of my spiritual father, I I know that I I didn't act babyish to him. I know that I didn't complain. I know that
1:18:49
I just probably simply told him as it was like one person came and they left
1:18:54
and but I kept looking um I then preached to the camera, you know, and he
1:19:00
probably just just said a simple I'm sure he just said like said a simple like encouragement, you know. Um
1:19:07
just a simple encouragement just like to keep going and keep believing. Yeah.
1:19:15
Oh, here's a good one. What's the most meaningful DM or comment you've ever received from a follower? So, I can't
1:19:22
say one. There's not one that sticks out, but I look at comment. I've always
1:19:28
looked at comments as much as I can. I can't look at them all, but every day I
1:19:33
look at comments. Every day I look at comments on social media and it's usually it's me that hearts a lot of
1:19:39
them. Most of a lot of them. But um as I look at them, Hardy them, but not on
1:19:46
every single one. We have a team also. But like I I I have been so blessed by so many of
1:19:54
your comments. This is one of been been this has been one of the big things that's gotten me through persecution. Um
1:20:00
I mean to to to persevere through persecution. um is because like what I've seen
1:20:06
through the comments is it's like God opened up my this is one of the ways
1:20:12
that God opened my eyes to see that there are more for me than against me.
1:20:17
This is what been one of the This has been one of the biggest blessings for me is
1:20:24
being able to see this, being able to see you, being able to see the revival army, being able to see that they see
1:20:31
the truth, being able to see that they there are so many pure hearts out there
1:20:38
that really want Jesus, that don't want this impure garbage that's out there,
1:20:46
but really want purity,
1:20:51
really want God's will to be done, really want to see people be set free,
1:20:58
really want purity in the church.
1:21:06
That's what I've seen through the comments through through through just like your your hearts through the
1:21:12
comments, your hearts of ju like just how you're touched by the teachings, how
1:21:18
you're touched by the miracles, how you're touched by the testimonies,
1:21:23
um, and also your own personal testimonies and also your own just the support you
1:21:30
show for this work of God. Um the the that that
1:21:37
it's strengthened me so much. It strengthened me so much to see how much
1:21:43
of a liar the devil is, how small he is, and how like he uses people and and it
1:21:51
sounds like a loud voice. The loud voice sound makes it seem like there's so many, but it's really just that facade
1:21:59
like the Wizard of Oz. I shared this last week, you know, like a facade like the Wizard of O like the Wizard of Oz
1:22:05
was a person, a small person with a microphone but had a huge mask. And
1:22:10
that's the devil. And that's the devil when he uses people, they get behind a mask and they shout something really
1:22:18
like really loud like through exposed videos and through things like this on social media, all that nonsense. Um,
1:22:24
that's what it is. And so that's been one of the big ways that I have seen the
1:22:30
truth. How I've seen there are so many for us than against us. There are so
1:22:37
many more believers that really stand with Jesus rather than standing with the devil, the
1:22:44
angel of light, the Pharisees. There's so many more. And it's giving me such
1:22:52
faith, a greater faith. It's giving me such contentment. has given me such peace and joy. It's It's kept me from
1:22:59
being worried or stressed. Just this revelation to be able to see the revival
1:23:06
army that you're real, that you're really out there standing with God, standing with
1:23:14
me. And and also like like to see your
1:23:19
hearts to see your hearts. That's why I read the comments all the
1:23:25
time because I make time to read the comments. I make time to It is me on
1:23:32
Instagram that goes through the the ads to my story. It is just me doing that on my personal Instagram. I make that time.
1:23:38
It takes quite a bit of time, but I make that time because
1:23:44
it it my faith is even built by it. just like seeing this revival army and
1:23:52
your testimonies mean the world. Your for me to hear your testimonies, it means the world and it it's so important
1:23:59
that that those testimonies get out there so that more people can see what I
1:24:04
see can that that this can see what you see.
1:24:11
Amen. Hallelujah.
1:24:37
Okay, this will be the last question I answer for today. Um, can you uh how has
1:24:43
your relationship with God changed over the journey to 1 million?
1:24:48
Um, my faith has grown so much.
1:24:56
My faith has grown so much. I've shared I feel like I've shared a
1:25:01
lot about this the past Sunday, actually. I mean, sorry, the past live stream. But
1:25:09
just going through what I' I've gone through a lot of opposition. I've gone through a lot of a lot of opposition
1:25:15
from the devil. I've gone through a lot of the devil screaming at me through through people.
1:25:23
Um, it's always through people. Glory to God. It's it's just that's the way that
1:25:29
I've seen the opposition. But I mean, praise God. Like, there's just a what I mean is there's such a protection
1:25:35
of God over me that it's not like I find a demonic presence in my house or
1:25:40
something like attacking me. There's just there's just so much protection. The devil's not allowed to do that. Glory to God. So really it's just people
1:25:47
that I found the biggest opposition. Um so I've seen I I've just I've just
1:25:55
experienced the devil act like Goliath through people act
1:26:01
really intimidating, really scary, really really evil, really hateful. I've
1:26:07
seen the devil do that a lot to me over these years on this journey. And um at
1:26:17
first it is intimidating. It you know it shakes you a little bit. you never encountered that before and it's like
1:26:25
you know you feel that and and like and I've gone through these these seasons
1:26:31
where God allows things like the Tik Tok account being taken was taken down you know like I've gone through seasons
1:26:37
where God allows things just like how Jo Joseph had to go through that being thrown in the pit
1:26:44
being thrown in prison being falsely accused just like David was had to hide
1:26:49
in caves for many years. He had God allowed that. And so I went through a
1:26:55
lot of God allowing opposition and it feeling like the devil
1:27:03
was winning in certain areas, but he never was. But just like the same way it felt like the devil was winning when
1:27:09
David was hiding in caves and when Joseph was in the pit and Joseph was in
1:27:14
the prison and Job was had all these things taken away from him
1:27:20
just like it felt like the devil was winning when Jesus was on the cross. But the devil was never winning in any of
1:27:27
that. Hallelujah. But you know you you go through those times where it like feels like the devil's winning and and
1:27:33
you go through those times first before you see the victory. So, it's such a test of faith. It's such like a I've
1:27:39
never gone through this before and I have no clue how I will see
1:27:45
breakthrough. I have no clue. For me, the big thing was like I had never seen
1:27:50
like false accusations and lies come at me before. And I never really seen that like come at other people before like on
1:27:56
a public scale. Like I never really like I never really like seen that and like seen the vindication of that before
1:28:04
really. So like when I experienced that it felt very heavy. I I saw a lot of
1:28:10
people be deceived. I would have a lot of people write to me like so many people writing to me when like false
1:28:17
accusations came towards me came at me. I I had a lot of people like renouncing
1:28:23
the deliverance they received and everything. I had a lot of people speaking to me like I was evil. Um, and
1:28:30
just totally deceived. And that was heartbreaking. And that in
1:28:36
that moment I was just like, how are they going to see the truth? Like how are they going to know? How are people
1:28:43
going to know? Like can people just keep on saying lies and then the tr like more
1:28:50
and more people are deceived? Like like how how will people know? Like I remember um feeling that way when I knew
1:28:58
it wasn't I knew God wasn't calling me to defend myself. I knew he was calling
1:29:03
me to wait on him and let him defend me. So I'm like if I don't like show I could
1:29:10
show certain things. I could show DMs, you know, these people that spoke lies
1:29:15
about me. I could show I could show these things, you know, and but I knew God didn't want me to do that. So I was like, how? There was just that feeling a
1:29:24
lot like how and it didn't feel hopeful. Like I believed I chose to believe, but
1:29:31
I didn't feel that like oh God's going to prove himself like oh it was just
1:29:38
blind faith without fulfilling. It was just I have no clue. I really wish I
1:29:44
could like wrap my head around how God's going to do this, but I just believe and
1:29:50
I just have to trust God and I just have to obey God and that's what I'll do. It
1:29:55
was a lot of that for years and
1:30:00
now years have passed and I've gone through a lot of opposition.
1:30:06
I've got a lot gone through a lot of what I was just talking about and but like I've just seen God
1:30:14
bring victory after victory. I've seen there's still so much vindication I'm
1:30:19
waiting on God for, of course. Um, but like I've seen that revival has just
1:30:26
kept speeding up and growing through all of that. And I've just seen the revival
1:30:31
army grow and grow and grow and grow. We have at 5F Church such an amazing team
1:30:37
of people who serve every week and across the world. So many people are
1:30:42
serving and we have small group leaders in 40 um different cities and nations
1:30:50
and some of them have multiple small group leaders, two or three. There's so many of these leaders. They've been here
1:30:56
for years and they really have pure hearts and they really have hearts for
1:31:02
Jesus and they really see clearly. They really see clearly the truth. They
1:31:08
really see through all the lies and they've they've been here for years
1:31:14
standing with the truth and that's just grown. It's just it's just grown. It's
1:31:20
grown year after year. And the comments like
1:31:26
there's so few bad comments. It surprises me because of
1:31:32
the amount of like exposed videos and all the bad comments on the exposed videos and stuff. Like you'd think that,
1:31:39
but I don't have to delete many comments and there's so many comments on social on all those social media pages. Glory
1:31:45
to God. But there's just year after year, God has just added and added and added upon people who see clearly who
1:31:54
because they have pure hearts, they can see God. The Bible says the pure in heart shall see God. So because they
1:32:01
have pure hearts, they can see the truth. As simple as that.
1:32:07
because their hearts aren't clouded with skepticism, judgment, pride, and or
1:32:13
jealousy. Because of that, they can see the truth. They won't hop on the
1:32:18
bandwagon of accusation, of being the accuser of the brethren,
1:32:23
of being um on a high horse judging others and
1:32:30
picking at the speck in their brother's eye when they have a plank in their own because they're not filled with jealousy
1:32:37
in their hearts that they're jumping on the bandwagon to um try to tear someone down so that they
1:32:43
can feel better about themselves and step on their back when they're down. You know, there's so many out there, so
1:32:50
many of you out there that God has just added and added and added, and it has
1:32:56
made my faith in God grow so big. It has made my trust in God grow so big. It has
1:33:05
made me see the devil for what he is like never before. He is so tiny, puny
1:33:14
compared to our God. He has nothing against our God. Nothing. It is not even
1:33:21
close to an even fight. He's a joke. He's defeated. He's under our feet.
1:33:28
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. So um yeah
1:33:35
my my that's how my relationship with God has grown is that my trust in him my
1:33:41
faith in him has grown and of course my love for him has grown so much
1:33:50
and my heart just bursts for others to grow spiritually.
1:33:55
My heart bursts for others to grow spiritually so that you can see how amazing God is
1:34:01
and so that you can walk in victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you Jesus.
1:34:09
Well, I want to pray over you all right now. Um, thank you Jesus. Thank you
1:34:15
Jesus. Thank you Jesus for what you have done on this live stream. Thank you Jesus for what you have done over these
1:34:21
years. Thank you, Jesus, for moving every mountain that has tried to hold back your revival. God, I thank you for
1:34:27
your perfect ways. I thank you for refining fire. I thank you for allowing me to go through things just like you
1:34:32
allowed your servants in the Bible to go through hard things. But I thank you, Lord, that that you always restore. You
1:34:40
always bring victory. You always vindicate. And you are always faithful. God, I
1:34:47
thank you. We thank you, Lord. We thank you Lord for the doors you have opened and the doors you will continue to open
1:34:53
in this year of acceptance for your revival. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
1:34:58
Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Well, I have seen God do as I shared. I've seen God
Prayer
1:35:04
do so many miracles on every single live stream ever since 2021.
1:35:11
There hasn't been a live stream where God didn't do many miracles. And there's
1:35:16
truly no limit to his power. It doesn't it it doesn't even matter what the oppression is, what the sickness is.
1:35:23
God's power is so big and is indeed moving through the screen that he will remove any kind of oppression, any kind
1:35:29
of sickness that you have. He will do it. His power is truly here and available for you now. Revival is now.
1:35:38
Hallelujah. So if you have demonic oppression of any kind or sickness, I encourage you to
1:35:43
renounce it right now. to speak it aloud, to just say, "I renounce anxiety. I renounce suicidal thoughts. I renounce
1:35:48
this sickness. I renounce this pain. I renounce addiction." Whatever it is. And this is one of a big key that that leads
1:35:57
to freedom that that that that that makes the chains to be loosened. The
1:36:03
chains that the devil's put and then the anointing comes upon those chains and pulls them off of you. Hallelujah. So,
1:36:09
you can speak that aloud right now. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you Lord. Right
1:36:15
now I declare that every curse, word curse must be broken in Jesus' name. I
1:36:23
break every generational curse. I break every curse of witchcraft. I break every demonic soul tie. I break every demonic
1:36:28
covenant in Jesus' name. And I detach you from everything you have renounced.
1:36:35
I declare right now that anything that the devil has stolen from
1:36:41
you, I declare it must be restored to you. I declare that what you sow in
1:36:48
tears, you will reap in joy. The Bible says, and so anything that you are doing
1:36:55
that is hard, anything that you the devil has brought opposition and it has brought tears.
1:37:02
I declare that restoration must come and fruit must come of your labors and such
1:37:10
joy must come in Jesus name. The devil will have to pay. The devil will have to
1:37:15
pay. I declare that anything the devil has taken from you, it must be released
1:37:20
back to you now in Jesus' name. And I declare some of you that you have maybe
1:37:27
it's maybe it's people that were taken, people have gone. I declare that new
1:37:32
blessings would come upon your life. Surprises, new blessings that are so
1:37:38
sweet that make you forget the bitterness of the loss that you endured,
1:37:43
the loss endured, the loss that the devil contributed to, how he took things
1:37:49
from you. I speak and I see some I see God, there's some of you like you've
1:37:55
lost people to suicide. You've lost loved ones too early. You've lost loved ones due to
1:38:04
works of the devil. And I declare right now healing to your heart.
1:38:10
What the enemy intended to bring you pain through taking something or someone from you. I speak this pain to stop now.
1:38:19
And I release anointing upon you. I declare healing to your heart now. I declare complete healing. And I declare
1:38:26
that you would not remember the things of the past that were negative, the abuse, the trauma, the loss,
1:38:34
the the the deep deep grief you've been carrying of a loss of a loved one. It must go in Jesus' name. This pain must
1:38:41
go in Jesus name. The sorrow must go. This darkness must go. This heaviness must go in Jesus' name. In Jesus' name.
1:38:49
Thank you, Lord. And I speak this anointing to come upon you. I speak joy to fill you. I speak doors to open up of
1:38:55
great blessings that will be so sweet that will that will reveal the love of
1:39:00
God to you that will be heaven a a way of heaven on earth coming in your life in Jesus' name I speak doors to open up

spiritual eyes. That your spiritual eyes would open up to see the beauty of the journey to see how you are perfectly in
1:41:22
God's wills and his ways are perfect. That you would find such contentment,
1:41:27
peace, and joy in this journey. and that you would not become obsessed with the promise that you would become discontent
1:41:33
in the waiting, but that you would be so at peace, so at rest in God's arms, in
1:41:42
God's will, that you would see the beauty, the joy, the value of the
1:41:49
present moment of today, of what God is doing today, of how God is using you

today. Let these eyes open up now to see and enjoy life with Jesus. Life serving

Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise
Announcements
1:43:40
God. This has been incredible. This has been so powerful. This has been just
1:43:47
beyond my imagin beyond beyond my expectations to celebrate with you all
1:43:54
what God has done this milestone of 1 million subscribers on YouTube. Glory to
1:44:00
God. Thank you Jesus. I want to encourage you all to keep sharing the
1:44:05
videos the con and this is for every social media. Let's get the other social media pages, 5F Church, and on my pages
1:44:13
as well, for the glory of God, for God's people to be reached more. Let's let's
1:44:18
get them up to 1 million, too. Amen. Hallelujah. And let's start aiming
1:44:24
ahead. Let's look ahead because we have just begun. We have just beun
1:44:30
this this great work God has called us to in this revival. It's just the beginning. So, let's let's go harder.
1:44:37
Let's go faster for Jesus in terms of spreading the good news through social
1:44:42
media and in every way. So, I encourage you um if you aren't already, I
1:44:48
encourage you to to share the videos, to interact on the videos and the posts,
1:44:54
all kind of posts. Interact with them so that that that's like you doing your
1:44:59
part to it's using your platform to get the word out there more because these
1:45:05
are the tools. This is how we work in wisdom. It's like how I didn't really I didn't really see the value at first. I
1:45:11
mean the importance yet of getting a Tik Tok account. I didn't really see that, you know, but thank God I you know I
1:45:17
heard the voice of the Holy Spirit saying there's tools I've given you. Use them
1:45:25
100%. Not 90%. Like use these tools. I can do wonders if you will use what's in
1:45:32
your hand. start a Tik Tok account, you know. So, this is like the same
1:45:38
principle of being more active on your social media. So, I encourage like it's
1:45:43
the same principle. You might think you're doing enough like I did without having the Tik Tok
1:45:49
account, but starting the Tik Tok account is what is what God chose to use
1:45:55
for revival to break out to make revival to break out.
1:46:01
So it's the same principle. You might be doing some, you might be doing a lot, do
1:46:06
more. Do more with your social media accounts. Like share like share and post
1:46:15
and also interact, comment, like the content so
1:46:22
that it can the it reaches more people. It makes the algorithm get it out to
1:46:27
more people. Amen. Um, oh, another praise report I just
1:46:33
want to share this past Sunday. I just want to I just I just want to share this. I'm just so thankful to God. I'm
1:46:39
just feeling so thankful to God for opening up doors that don't rely on like
1:46:44
powerful people and people in influence, you know, um like through social media.
1:46:50
I really I really want to thank God for this through YouTube, through all social media, but like so I just want to share
1:46:56
this testimony of this door that God opened up to reach more many way many more people. So on Instagram,
1:47:03
um I shared on I shared this past Sunday that they there's this feature where you can put out a reel that doesn't go to
1:47:10
any of your followers, but it spits it out into the Instagram world. um like
1:47:17
just spits it out to people who don't follow you. And um so there's a video,
1:47:24
such a touching video of a young boy, many of you might have seen it, but a young boy who was just so desperate for
1:47:30
his mom to come out of sin and receive Jesus and go to heaven with him. He was
1:47:35
just so desperate for this. This is like his biggest heart's cry. And he was young. He looks like
1:47:43
between six and eight. I don't know. But um he came this was actually like a year ago. He came to church with this with
1:47:48
holding his mom holding a picture of his mom in tears with the in desperation
1:47:54
with this prayer request he said to me. And so we shared a video of this um and I prayed for him and we're standing in
1:48:01
faith for him and his for his mom. But this video it we put it out on this
1:48:08
feature and um it's almost reached 1 million views. 99% do not follow me. So
1:48:17
that's literally it was at 900,000 something today. So this is another one million people that have just been
1:48:26
exposed to revival and the power of God perhaps for the first time. Glory to
1:48:32
God. And as of earlier, a few hours ago, there was like 7600
1:48:39
people who became followers on my Instagram account through this one video. Glory to God. That's a lot of
1:48:48
people. That's a lot of people that God opened up doors to to to reach to
1:48:54
encounter his power and to be equipped and to step into this revival. Glory to God. I just wanted to share that with
1:49:00
you to celebrate what God did and just to me it just opens like seeing that
1:49:05
like it's and and there hasn't been a video that does something like that in a long time. So to me it's like it
1:49:10
happened actually it was like at its peak on Sunday the day that the video uh that the YouTube hit 1 million. So to
1:49:17
me, God was celebrating, you know, God was celebrating um
1:49:22
and and it's just prophetic like it's this it's the year of acceptance. But um I just to me this is this is just
1:49:29
opening up my eyes so much about how it's so simple and easy for God to open
1:49:35
up doors. We don't need a a certain door to be open. God can move in any way.
1:49:40
God, you know, you you you can be wanting like a certain person to open up a door for you, maybe to invite you to
1:49:46
their podcast or have you on their TV show or something like something like that, you know, and and and but but God
1:49:53
can reach just as much people um through a little reel on the social media or
1:49:59
more people, you know, and so um wow, Jesus, thank you. Thank you, Jesus, for
1:50:06
for opening up doors that are beyond our expectations that that
1:50:12
that no one can shut. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:50:19
Praise God. Um, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Well, I want to um just
1:50:26
invite all of you right now to if you would like to give to the work of God, um you can go to fiveofchurch.org/give

our finances is through offering. This is one of the big ways that you'll find reaping. And I'm a testimony of that in
1:52:23
my life. I have never stopped sewing. I was so generously all through these years of stepping into
1:52:29
my calling. And I know with all my heart, it's a big reason why I see reaping and I see fruit in my life and
1:52:35

your life. I speak doors to open up for you financially and I speak blessings to pour upon you in Jesus' name. Be blessed
1:53:04

Lord, growing in wisdom. So you can subscribe to me on my Instagram. You hit the subscribe button and then you'll get
1:56:18
access to the subscriber Q&As's. Um, so this Friday it will be at 1 pm Pacific
1:56:23
time. Um, also,
1:56:30
um, oh, big announcement. So, I have, if you're new here, I have written a
1:56:38
book called Unlock Your Deliverance. It came out in April. And in this book, I reveal the keys to freedom that unlock
1:56:45
your freedom from demonic oppression. So as you read this book, you will learn how to receive deliverance, complete
1:56:53
deliverance, and the anointing is released in this book. And you'll receive deliverance as you read. And I
1:56:59
also reveal how to maintain the deliverance and walk in abundant abundant life. This book is for
1:57:06
everybody. Most most people have some sort of oppression, have some sort of area in their life that is not abundant
1:57:12
life that God intended. Um so I believe everyone needs this book. I encourage you to get at least one extra book to
1:57:19
share with others. We have so many people um who are part of the revival army who have generously given tons of
1:57:28
books away to people. Many of them have been strangers. Many of them they've just left them somewhere. I do it too. I
1:57:34
leave it I like to leave it in airports when I'm traveling um with a note saying, "Do you need a miracle?" And
1:57:40
because there there's so many who are just walking around who who God wants to
1:57:46
use this book to reach them and deliver
1:57:52
them. So I encourage you to to share this book with others. There's an audio book as well. There's an ebook as well.
1:57:59
Um and you can get it all over the world online. It'll ship like everywhere in the world pretty much I think. Um if it
1:58:06
can't there's the audio book and the ebook online. Um, and it's on Amazon,
1:58:11
Barnes & Noble, anywhere books are sold, you can find it. And today, very exciting news, very exciting news.
1:58:18
Today, I have announced that there is a French translation of Unlock Your Deliverance. It is available now. You
1:58:26
can find the link a link uh on it's on most French a lot of French bookstores,
1:58:31
online bookstores. Um, but also we put it on at the link in our bow and our

1:58:59

1:59:05
can entrust with anointing and actually how to heal the sick and cast out
1:59:10
demons. Um, and there's a lot of different translations of them. I'm
1:59:15
holding a lot of them in my hands right now, but we have Indonesian, Norwegian, German, French, Dutch translations um,
1:59:22
of that one. And more translations are going to be coming of this. I'll be announcing them when the time comes. But praise God, there's more translations
1:59:27
that are coming. Hallelujah. I'm so blessed by that. Thank you Jesus for those open doors. I also have um I
1:59:36
have an ecourse called walking in miracles which is a great companion with the secret of the anointing book where I
1:59:41
teach on how to access the anointing and be a vessel of God's power. Um so you
1:59:48
can get that at the link in my bio and also um on our website 5church.org and my personal website apostle cric.com.
1:59:55
I also have a new ecourse coming in the fall, Deliverance Made Simple, where I teach you how to help lead others to be
2:00:03
set free, how to cast out demons. And I'm so excited for many in the body of Christ to be equipped to be able to help
2:00:11
people be set free, and to do what God has called them to do, you to do. One of the things God has called every believer
2:00:18
to do is to cast out demons, to lead others into freedom. So, I'm so excited for that to come out soon. I'll keep you
2:00:24
updated of the exact date soon. Um, yeah. So, I also want to warn those of
2:00:30
you that are new here, I need to warn you. There are many scammers and impersonators of me. The best way to know that it's really my um social media
2:00:38
account is all of my social media accounts have more than 200,000 followers. 200,000 followers or more.
2:00:44
Um, except for X. X is Katherine Crick. That's the easiest way for you to just
2:00:50
know um that it's me. Okay? Okay, I will not DM you with a prophetic message. I will not DM you, period. But I will not
2:00:56
DM you with a prophetic message. I will not DM you with a prophetic message and then say you need to give, you should give a seed somewhere. That's not me.
2:01:02
That's a scammers. I don't have any Facebook groups, just my page pages. I don't have any Facebook groups like a
2:01:09
prayer request group. Those are out there and they are fake. They are run by scammers, impersonators. So don't join
2:01:14
Facebook groups that are like my picture and everything. That's not me. Um, also
2:01:21
I do not reply to your comments saying things like, "I want to talk to you more." Anything like that. That's not
2:01:28
me. That's the scammers. I do not have Gmail, WhatsApp, or Telegram. The only way to contact my ministry is by
2:01:34
emailing info@5church.org or hitting the contact form on our official website, which is 5church.org
2:01:41
or the contact form at apostle.com. Also, the only way to book me is by
2:01:46
emailing info@5church.org or the booking form on fivefchurch.org or apostle
2:01:51
cathncrick.com. I do never I never write to people. I have never written to anybody asking
2:01:57
asking them to have me to minister. I have never done that. The only booking
2:02:03
has been done through um info@5church.org email or the booking contact forms. Um
2:02:10
so that's a scheme of the scammers too. So um just just letting you know these
2:02:15
schemes so you can be aware. Also, I will not do video calls. So, if you're getting a FaceTime from me, it's not me.
2:02:22
Um, and like if there's a they might put a video of me trying to make it look
2:02:27
like I'm live. Um, and then also I've also heard like AI uh like be aware of
2:02:33
AI voice memos. So, I will not be sending voice notes to you, okay? So, it
2:02:39
could sound like me, but it with AI it's you can know it's not me. So, hallelujah. Share this info with your
2:02:47
with anyone that you um share my ministry. Share my ministry with them so
2:02:52
that they're aware and don't get scammed. Amen. All right. Hallelujah.
2:02:58
Well, thank you, Jesus, for everything you've done today. This has been so amazing. I thank Jesus. I feel his joy
2:03:05
so strongly. I truly know he did so much today. I thank you, Lord. I thank you,
2:03:10
