Message
1:48
All right. Well, I'm going to be teaching today about how to evangelize in the new wine. So, if you're new here
1:55
and you're wondering what the new wine is, Jesus said to the Pharisees to um
2:03
to them when they were saying, you know, why are you not fasting? Why are your
2:08
disciples not fasting like how the Pharisees fast, like how John the Baptist disciples fast? You're not
2:16
fasting like so regularly um and in a ritual way like like the
2:21
Pharisees are like John John the Baptist disciples are. And
2:26
Jesus's response, part of Jesus's response is you cannot put new wine into
2:31
old wine skins for it will burst. You need new wine skins to put the new wine in. And the meaning of that is Jesus was
2:39
coming in a new way. And this was the true way. This was a way that was led by
2:45
the Holy Spirit. And it wasn't about rules and rituals and traditions and
2:51
just doing something going through the motions and not do and and doing things
2:57
out of performance and to um perform your way earn your way to salvation and
3:04
to be righteous, but to do things that God instructs
3:09
led by him, led by the Holy Spirit.
3:14
um instead of this just ritual way which takes away the meaning and power behind
3:21
what you're doing whether that's fasting whether that's praying whether that's reading the word whether that's taking
3:29
communion whether that's evangelizing etc. So um in summary, the old wine
3:39
means the religious doctrine that the Pharisees had. This religious doctrine
3:49
kept them from recognizing Jesus and learning
3:54
from Jesus, learning the secrets of the kingdom and
3:59
entering into the kingdom. That's what the old the old wine held them back.
4:05
Their religion, their doing things not from the heart of pleasing God, but
4:12
doing it out of performance, making themselves feel better. Many people
4:17
today are doing are now living in the old wine still. This is a great scheme
4:23
of the devil to try to even though people confess Jesus as Lord, they act like the Pharisees. they have the
4:31
doctrine of the Pharisees. So there's many Christians today that they are not
4:37
um I mean they they they call themselves followers of Jesus. They they call themselves Christians but they end up
4:45
persecuting Jesus without realizing it because Jesus moves through the new
4:50
wine. Jesus moves in in in in in in a new way. He comes in a new way like we
4:58
haven't seen before. such as moving in power, casting out demons, moving through apostles and prophets, moving in
5:05
the prophetic anointing. We see Jesus moving in this way today.
5:11
It has been rare that he would that he that we would see that, but we're seeing him move like how he moved in the
5:18
gospels, like how he moved through the apostles and the fifoldful ministers in the book of Acts. But there's people
5:23
today that are calling themselves Christians, going to Christian churches,
5:30
saying the name of Jesus all the time, praising the name of Jesus, but
5:35
literally uh persecuting and rejecting Jesus as Jesus moves in
5:43
power, as Jesus moves in the new wine, as Jesus moves through new wine revelation that so many have not known
5:50
for so long. Um, so it it's there's nothing new under the sun. So it repeats itself. This way
5:58
that this enemy the enemy uh blinded the Pharisees from receiving Jesus. The
6:04
enemy tries to come in that same way to blind so-called Christians from truly
6:12
accepting Jesus or ex and accepting Jesus in his fullness. Um, so that was
6:17
how it was with the Pharisees. The Pharisees were um they were they were
6:23
worshiping the same God as the follow as the disciples of Jesus were as Jesus
6:29
was. The father was Jesus's Lord. They were one. But you know he followed the
6:37
father. He worshiped the father. He prayed to the father. And the the
6:42
Pharisees were praying to the father. We're praying to the same god. We're worshiping the same God. Jesus and the
6:50
Pharisees were both following reading the the the the word of God which at
6:55
that point would have been Old Testament because then when Jesus came that be that that was the New Test that be began
7:01
the New Testament. Um so you know it's it's but they were rejecting the same
7:08
God they were worshiping because Jesus was God was one with the father. You
7:13
see, so it's the same thing today except for back then they wouldn't even uh say
7:19
that they were worshiping Jesus, say that Jesus is Lord. Now today people say that Jesus is Lord. They worship Jesus
7:25
but they reject him when he's coming as he comes in the new wine. Just as the
7:32
Pharisees rejected the new wine, they rejected him healing people, delivering people. They rejected him healing people
7:39
on the Sabbath. Um they rejected him doing a new thing uh uh uh moving in a
7:47
new way and so that is so is rejected by and large by Christians today. I just
7:53
wanted to share a brief a very brief overview of what the new wine is versus
7:59
old wine. Um I have shared many teachings about this
8:05
because this is so foundational of what God is doing now of this revival
8:11
that he has brought. Uh because what we read about in the gospels and in
8:17
the book of acts this the way Jesus moved the way Jesus ministered the way
8:24
he revealed the kingdom of God and how to enter the kingdom of God. that was the new wine and that has been lost by
8:32
and large and now God is restoring it in his revival in this global revival that
8:39
he has brought. Um and so I've taught so much about this. So if you are new here
8:47
uh you can go to my YouTube channel and I have a playlist that's how to be free
8:55
of religion and um there's a lot of teachings where
9:00
basically it's how to be free of the old wine and how to step fully into the new
9:07
wine. So I teach so much more in depth on that um on that playlist you can find
9:13
um more okay but I just wanted to give first of all that overview um so you can
9:19
understand about evangelizing in the new wine so um
9:26
I'm sharing about evangelizing in the new wine today because this is the year of acceptance and um first of all it is
9:34
always it it is always God's will for us to be
9:40
sharing the good news far and wide to every day have on our hearts have our in
9:46
have it in our intention to spread the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ
9:51
to spread this good news that Jesus is alive and he's moving in power to heal
9:56
deliver and save and bring you abundant life.
10:02
Um, but in this year of acceptance, prophetically, it's the year of acceptance. It's the acceptable year of
10:09
the Lord. And so what that means is that God has been pursuing many people around
10:16
the world for a long time. It's been seed after seed that's been planted. And
10:21
in this year, it is harvest time. In this year, there's going to be a lot of people that
10:28
receive Jesus, that receive Jesus in his fullness, that receive his revival.
10:35
It is time for people to accept Jesus.
10:40
It is time. The harvest is ripe. It's the right time. Hallelujah. And so,
10:48
um, the Bible says, there's a scripture in the Bible where Jesus says, "The harvest is ripe, but the laborers are
10:54
few." Uh, so the harvest is ripe right now. And we need to go as laborers to
11:04
bring in that harvest. And a big way that harvest is brought in is by sharing
11:10
the good news. is sharing about revival, sharing about Jesus, sharing your testimony, sharing about what he is
11:16
doing now, that his power is available to heal and deliver and save. Um to just
11:23
let people know and people are many people are going to receive this good news excitedly. They are going to be so
11:31
happy to receive this good news. they are going to come to Jesus soon after
11:37
you share this good news because prophetically it's the year of
11:43
acceptance. So more than ever, right now, it is so
11:48
important to be evangelizing, spreading the good news far and wide
11:56
and just be ready to to see yourself as a laborer to bring in the harvest each
12:02
day. The harvest is ripe. I better pluck the, you know, pick the grains or
12:08
whatever the terms would be of bringing in the harvest. I got to go to work and bring it in.
12:14
Hallelujah. Cuz it's ready. Amen. So, I want to share with you how to
12:20
evangelize in the new wine. This is different than the old wine. A lot of people have had to learn,
12:28
unlearn the wrong ways, the religious ways, the old wine ways in many different aspects.
12:34
One of them meaning evangelizing, um, spreading the good news. Because you
12:40
know everything that God instructs us to do it can be done the wrong way or the
12:45
right way. It can be done with the wrong doctrine with the old wine doctrine like
12:50
how the Pharisees were were following the word of God. They were following it in a wrong way a wrong doctrine or it
12:57
can be followed in the right way in the right doctrine in the new wine. Amen.
13:03
All right. So
13:10
first of all, you are called to be the light of the world. Jesus calls you to
13:16
be the light of the world. What that means is as you receive Jesus as Lord and you surrender your life to him and
13:23
you obey him day by day by day, he transforms your heart. He transforms you
13:29
to be more like him. And when Jesus when Jesus comes to live inside of you, when
13:34
you give your life to him, light starts beaming beaming through you because
13:42
Jesus is the light of the world. Um in him there is no darkness and his light
13:47
is so powerful that it overcomes all darkness. He is brighter than the sun.
13:53
He created the sun. He created the sun. So that gives you an indicator of how bright Jesus is. if he created the sun.
14:02
So um of God, Jesus and God are one. So of how bright God is if God created the
14:08
sun. So when you give your life to Jesus, it's like the sun brighter than the sun is
14:15
emanating through you. And it really can be seen. It really can be seen. Whether
14:20
people tell you or not, they will see something different about you. They will see a glow about you. They will see love
14:26
coming through you. They will feel peace around you. They will feel a contagious
14:32
joy around you. Um and people are longing for the light. People are in
14:39
many people, the people who are lost, who don't know Jesus, they are in darkness and they long to be in the
14:44
light. And many people don't know that Jesus is the light, but they're longing for the light, not knowing that Jesus is
14:51
the light. But everybody's longing for the light. Nobody wants to really be in
14:56
darkness. They may they may they may they may say they want to be in darkness. They may dress themselves in
15:02
all these dark things, but deep down they're miserable. So deep down
15:07
they're not happy in the darkness. And when they see some light, when they experience love, they prefer that. Amen.
15:15
So um the more you obey God, the more you continually surrender to God, the
15:22
more bright you become, the more the more you transform to be more like
15:29
Jesus. So the it's like it's like a little bit of Jesus can be seen at first and then a lot of Jesus can be seen as
15:36
time goes by. You become brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter. And Jesus calls us to be the light of the
15:43
world. And he calls us to be the light to shine his light to to direct people
15:49
to him. To be the light to to turn people to him, not to turn people to
15:55
yourself. Not to turn people, oh, look how awesome I am. Look at my light. Look how great I am. Um, do things for me.
16:01
Serve me. Uh, you know, give me things. Give me money. Give me
16:08
favor. No, we are called to be the light to point people to Jesus. So that when
16:13
people start showing us favor, when people start commenting on how much, you know, they enjoy being around us and we
16:21
have good energy, they can call it um we they feel peace and joy around us that
16:27
we would point them to Jesus. We would tell them, "This is Jesus. I didn't used to be this way. God totally transformed
16:33
me and now Jesus lives in me and he's given me this peace and joy." And so that's what you're sensing. It's Jesus.
16:40
And you can have that too. You can have this too. Um so that's that's what we
16:47
are called to be the light of the world to attract people to attract people so
16:52
that they would see wow I want what you have. What is your secret? Uh or or or
16:58
just even and also that they would they would respect you because you're so full of light that they respect you. They
17:04
look up to you. They they're like, "Wow, man." They have so much joy.
17:11
Good energy. Good energy they would call it that I
17:17
they'll immediately respect. They'll immediately like see you as wise and want to know your secrets. And so
17:23
they'll just like end up listening to you, like listening closely to you,
17:29
taking your word as valuable. Okay. So that's that's that's that's how we bring
17:36
people to Jesus. We are attractive. We we show people what they need. We we
17:42
show people how amazing Jesus is with our lives, with our words, with our actions, with our smile, with our good
17:48
deeds. And it literally draws them. It attracts them to listen closely to us,
17:56
to to to respond to our invitations, to come to church, for example.
18:02
um to watch this video, watch this live stream um to listen closely to our
18:08
testimony and maybe they were an atheist but all because your light is shining
18:15
and they find this respect towards you. They have respect for you and they want what you have
18:21
for the first time as they're hearing somebody talk about Jesus. Even though they've heard people talk about Jesus in the past, but when they hear you talk
18:27
about Jesus because the true light, the true light that you are emanating, they
18:33
feel something different inside. They feel a curiosity to check out this Jesus
18:41
more when before they had no interest.
18:47
Hallelujah. So the first thing, the first way to make
18:52
sure you are spreading the good news, evangelizing in a way that's pleasing to God, led by
18:59
the Holy Spirit, is to keep this truth in your heart that you are called to be
19:04
the light of the world. You are called to attract people.
19:09
Attract people by being like Jesus. attract people by loving, being being
19:17
compassionate towards them, being gentle, having the fruits of the Holy Spirit, having gentleness, kindness,
19:23
self-control, um selflessness, uh and no judgment,
19:31
no pride, no skepticism, criticalness,
19:38
but love and purity, compassion, kindness,
19:43
That's how you be the light of the world is by having the fruits of the Holy
19:48
Spirit and showing them and nothing else. That's how you be the light of the
19:54
world. Um it says
20:01
in Matthew 9:35, Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues proclaiming the good news of
20:07
the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them
20:13
because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd. Okay. So
20:20
Jesus, he's seen the crowds. He's seen the crowds. Okay. And these
20:25
crowds, these crowds that he was seeing, they were people who were lost. They
20:32
were people who were in darkness. They were people who were sinning. They were people who were influenced by the devil.
20:39
They were people who doing who were doing evil things because they were not yet saved. And when he looked at them,
20:47
what did he how did he see them? It says when he saw the crowds, he had
20:53
compassion on them. He had compassion on them. He did not
20:58
have judgment on them. Even though Jesus was sinless and perfect and God is the
21:04
judge. Jesus is one with God, he has the authority to judge them. But he didn't.
21:11
He had nothing but compassion on them. He understood that they didn't yet have
21:18
a shepherd to show them the way. He understood that
21:24
they needed salvation. They were in darkness and that wasn't their fault.
21:31
They needed salvation. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't earn anything to be saved.
21:39
Jesus needed to make that sacrifice for them, for us. And when we can simply
21:46
believe, he will transform our lives. He would transform their lives. Okay? So, he's
21:54
seeing them before ministering to them, before ministering
22:00
to them, before them getting to see the light, being introduced to the light. He's
22:06
seeing them not with judgment, but compassion.
22:13
We don't see Jesus going around judging people. We don't we don't see him giving
22:19
messages saying, "You evil people, I've seen all the evil things you've done and
22:26
you should be ashamed of yourselves. How could you do these things? You are
22:31
really evil. Repent, you sinners." We don't see Jesus
22:38
speaking this way. From the beginning, he had compassion on them. He ministered to them. He
22:46
demonstrated his power. He revealed his power. He poured out his anointing upon them so that they could meet him, fall
22:53
in love with him, and surrender.
23:00
He didn't he didn't have to convince them and force them into it. He didn't have to con he didn't have to say, "You
23:07
are so evil. You should repent because you're so evil."
23:13
He showed love and he he let people choose him
23:20
because they fell in love with him. That's how God wants salvation to be.
23:27
Not forceful, not you're evil, you're sinning. Repent
23:34
or you're going to hell, you sinners. That was never Jesus. He had compassion
23:41
on them and he showed them love. He did not judge them. He spoke against the Pharisees when they were judging people
23:49
when they were trying wanting to throw stones at the woman who was in so much
23:54
sin. And he says, "You who haven't sinned anything at all, you can throw a
24:01
stone." meaning how dare you judge because
24:07
you yourselves have sinned. That's our Jesus. And so he's speaking
24:14
the same thing today to all of you, all of us,
24:19
that unless you have never sinned a day in your entire life, including before
24:25
you met Jesus, you better not judge somebody. You do
24:30
not have the authority to judge, to to throw a stone. Instead, show compassion to people. Show
24:38
love to people so that people can actually be saved. Because people will not be truly saved
24:45
until they fully surrender to Jesus. You cannot force surrender. Surrender is
24:51
from the heart. Surrender cannot be performance. Surrender has to be from
24:57
the heart. Surrender to Jesus can only come from
25:03
the heart from a person's free will own choice. And the only way that can come
25:10
is when somebody meets Jesus see sees how amazing his love is.
25:17
See his unconditional love. Void of condemnation and judgment. And
25:23
that's when a person falls in love and realizes they can put their entire trust
25:31
in Jesus. And so they then surrender everything.
25:37
And so the the main way God pursues
25:43
people by his love where people meet him
25:48
is through us. Is through people. That means we have a huge responsibility
25:56
to represent Jesus rightly. We have a huge responsibility to be nothing but
26:02
loving and have and and compassionate
26:08
and never judgmental and condemning.
26:14
Now in the old wine way of much of Christianity today,
26:22
we see these these this Pharisee way, you know, the the Pharisee way. They
26:28
were following the word of God that says to stone. They were they were thinking that they were following God.
26:36
They were thinking that this was going to move people to repentance when they threw stones.
26:43
Teaching them a lesson, showing them what you're doing is wrong.
26:48
There is consequences. You need to repent or else this torment
26:54
will continue for eternity. So, here's a taste of it now with the throwing of the
27:00
stones. So, wake up and repent.
27:08
The Pharisees were doing that. They were judging. They were throwing the stones
27:15
because they thought they were following God. They thought they would bring about
27:21
repentance in this woman and and an and making her an example to others so that others would repent.
27:29
So this same wrong old wine doctrine is going on in the in the body of Christ
27:35
today where people they want to call out evil. They
27:42
want to they want to draw attention to evil. they want to um like use their
27:47
social media and just be judgmental and be like gh can you believe how this evil
27:52
thing that this person's doing that this person's doing that these groups of people are doing how evil they are yada
27:58
yada yada yada but like the thing is well number one
28:03
if those people that are evil like see that social media post for example
28:10
they're seeing you as a Pharisee they're seeing you with the the coldness of a
28:16
Pharisee and it's turning them away from Jesus
28:22
rather than drawing them, attracting them to Jesus.
28:28
And now there's other people that may see those social media posts or not just
28:34
social media, but even just it can be like people on the street with a megaphone and like calling people to
28:42
repentance but in a judgmental condemning way rather than a compassionate way. So it can be like
28:48
that or it can be just a group of five people maybe and you're just talking about
28:55
you're you're talking in a way that's that's judgmental and condemning.
29:00
So in whichever way people are listening and you can be talking about oh this
29:06
person or this group of people is doing so much evil and speaking in this judgmental way
29:13
um but thinking it's in a righteous way like um
29:20
calling out evil you know like to to draw people into repentance by calling out evil you know but the people
29:28
overhearing they're affected too. They're seeing, oh, if this is who Jesus is, that's not
29:34
very attractive. That is not love. That is not compassionate. That is judgmental. That's condemning. They're
29:40
not attracted. People don't know Jesus. They overhear you. So, even though you're not talking about directly them, they overhear you. They see your social
29:46
media posts and it's pushing people away from Jesus rather than drawing them to
29:52
Jesus, attracting them to Jesus. Uh it says in 2 Timothy 3:1, "You should
30:00
know this Timothy that in the last days there will be very difficult times for people will love only themselves and
30:06
their money. They will be boastful and proud. They will be loving moving forward there
30:14
will be they they will be unloving and unforgiving. They will slander others and have no
30:20
self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good."
30:25
Um they will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride and love pleasure pleasure rather than God.
30:32
They will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them
30:37
godly. So I think a lot of times when people read this passage
30:42
um they're thinking that like it's saying in the last times the people in the world who are not Christians will
30:50
you know be so evil but it's literally saying these people these
30:58
people in the last days will they will they will do all this what these things they'll be unforgiving unloving prideful
31:04
they will act religious They will act religious. So this is
31:10
referring to Christians, people who call themselves Christians. They will act religious, but they will reject the
31:16
power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that.
31:23
So there's no coincidence that the same people that seem to be so judgmental, so
31:30
prideful, um just in general, uh the way they talk about the state of the world,
31:35
it's like so depressing, like so many people are doing so many evil things and
31:40
it's just such a focus there. Those people tend to be tend to be the same people that persecute
31:49
Jesus moving in power anointed vessels.
31:56
They will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them godly.
32:03
They act religious. They act righteous. preaching about Jesus so much, but
32:10
not love and compassion, but judgmental, um, skeptical, uh, prideful,
32:17
um, focusing on the evil people are doing and like calling it out and, um,
32:26
being that Pharisee way of throwing stones, thinking that's going to lead people to repentance.
32:32
And so they're the same ones that reject the power of God, reject the
32:38
anointing, the revival. Um, so it says they act religious, but
32:45
they will they reject they will reject the power that can make them godly. Now remember I said the way we are the light
32:50
of the world is by being transformed by Jesus. We need God's power to be transformed. We need his anointing. We I
32:58
we cannot be transformed by preaching after preaching, preaching after preaching, preaching after preaching
33:05
that doesn't carry anointing. We cannot be transformed when when when
33:10
we you cannot be transformed when you have yolks and you keep going to church, but the yolks remain, the bondage
33:17
remains because there's no anointing to deliver you. You'll keep staying in that pattern of sin because there's a literal
33:26
chain around you that's the devil influencing you to do such things. I
33:33
was a Christian my whole life. Would go to church two times a week and
33:38
on Sunday I would go to four or five of the of the services the church I was going to because they have they would
33:44
have like four or five services depending. I would listen to the sermon four or five ta times on that Sunday. I
33:51
diligently listen and I honestly didn't find myself transforming at all. I
33:57
wanted to transform. I wanted to surrender. But it wasn't until I encountered the power of God. It wasn't
34:03
until I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and the fire of God burned away the
34:09
flesh, the carnal nature, and set my spirit on fire.
34:14
It wasn't until I experienced the power of God, the prophetic anointing,
34:21
opening up my eyes to the love of God and the worthiness, his worthy, how
34:27
worthy God is of of of to be feared, to have the fear of God and to surrender
34:33
everything. Then it was instant surrender. It was instant instant instant total surrender.
34:41
When my whole life I struggled to surrender was lukewarm for a lot of it.
34:47
No trans not transforming whole life very quick
34:53
one couple encounters the power of God completely transformed. So you need the power of God. You need
35:01
to accept revival. You need to accept the anointing. You need to accept God's servants who carry anointing. apostles,
35:08
prophets, you need to accept all of these principles of God that
35:17
bring about his power to receive his power in your life to
35:23
then transform. So the the religious people, the people in the old wine, they reject his power.
35:32
And because they reject his power, they don't transform. They don't transform to be more like
35:38
Jesus. And therefore, they are not the light of the world. They are they are
35:44
doing damage to the the church because they're persecuting Jesus and they're not attracting the lost to be saved, to
35:52
come into the kingdom, to come to Jesus. So um you know so let this verse they
35:59
will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them godly. So this is very important for you to
36:06
know how there's been a lot of old wine in the church today. So when you've seen evangelizing in the past when you've
36:11
seen people share about Jesus with others or maybe just on their social media even
36:17
a lot of what you seen a lot of what you learned a lot of what you've experienced was full of old wine. was it was
36:24
religious. It was it was from people who weren't godly
36:29
actually religious. And and and another translation that you may be may be more
36:35
familiar with is they have a form of godliness but deny its power.
36:43
Um so they have this form of godliness. They act religious, but they are they
36:50
are actually not godly from within because they haven't accepted the power of God to change them. And so they're
36:55
not being the light of the world. So you have to be aware of this. You have to be you have to make sure you are make you have to make sure you're unlearning
37:03
um these wrong ways. And I'm telling you, it's been so prevalent in the church. Evangelizing this religious way
37:09
has been so prevalent in the church. So, um,
37:17
be take note of of of like what you've learned, what you've
37:22
seen. Um, take take note. Got brighter in here.
37:29
Take note. Um, and and be aware. Okay, this was wrong. This was judgmental.
37:35
This was this does not show the love of Jesus. This does not show compassion. This is not attractive.
37:46
I need to unlearn this and learn the right way, learn the new wine way. Amen.
37:52
Hallelujah. Um,
37:59
so what's so important when you're evangelizing is to to make sure that you
38:06
have been transformed by God's power. You need to make sure you're doing your
38:12
part to be transformed so you represent Jesus rightly. You go out into the world
38:18
and you shine your light and you show love and you show compassion. You do this through social media. You do this
38:24
when when you're going out and evangelizing. Okay. So
38:31
next, what's so important when you're evangelizing is
38:39
to know the importance of leading Jesus, leading people to where they can find
38:44
Jesus and encounter Jesus and not put it all on yourself. There are some who plant seeds, there
38:50
are some who waters. It says 1 Corinthians 3:69, I planted the seed. Apollo's watered it, but God has been
38:57
making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who makes things
39:04
grow. The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own
39:11
labor. For we are co-workers in God's service. You are God's field, God's building. So a lot of people put on put
39:20
pressure on themselves especially in the old wine way of um I got to lead a
39:26
person to Jesus when really they should have the intention of I have to plant a
39:32
seed or I have to water whatever God wants me to do for this
39:39
situation. I have to be a vessel of God and shine my light.
39:46
Um because sometimes it's just time to plant. God never forces himself.
39:52
He never forces himself. He pursues people but gently. And the
39:57
Bible says, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart."
40:03
So he has this principle where he really does not want to force himself on people. He really wants people to choose
40:10
him to really make that decision to make that covenant like a marriage covenant.
40:19
It's not an arranged marriage. God doesn't want to manipulate people.
40:24
God doesn't want to coersse people, convince people. He wants because he
40:30
knows that the only way there'll be true surrender is when a person really falls in love. And that can't happen when
40:37
somebody's been manipulated, forced prematurely. Their eyes need to see the love of God.
40:46
And that comes when they seek in their own will and they discover how amazing
40:52
Jesus is. So part of representing Jesus rightly is making sure you're not
40:58
manipulating people into receiving Jesus. You're not forcing people into receiving Jesus. You're not trying to
41:04
make a case and argue with somebody and just convince them that you're right. Um
41:12
and and this part of this also is not you don't want to manipulate people like
41:17
into going to heaven like do you want to go to hell? Well, you need to decide right now. You know, so people if people
41:25
make decisions if they if they send to say the sinner's prayer and they start reading the Bible like they do it out of
41:32
obligation, they are they are immediately opening up
41:38
a huge door to the the devil masquerading himself as the angel of light, the spirit of religion. And you
41:44
cannot surrender to Jesus when you are following the devil's voice coming as
41:50
the angel of light, this religious voice. You can't surrender to God. And I
41:56
went through that myself. I I heard the spirit of religion. I would hear the condemning voice. And I wasn't in love
42:02
with Jesus through all of that. And I was lukewarm. But when my eyes opened up and saw
42:07
Jesus, I was set free from this this deceit of the religious spirit.
42:13
Now I can now I could then I could surrender everything you see. So like
42:19
when you come in this like uh forceful way do you want to go to
42:25
hell and and and and it's like leading people to
42:32
become a Christian because of out of fear. It's setting them up to be deceived by
42:41
the devil masquering himself as an angel of light. So this is very serious. Like this is this is very serious.
42:48
How to represent Jesus. I mean even you're planting seeds and you're so showing so much love and people realize that you're a Christian that's already
42:55
teaching them the voice of God. That's already teaching them
43:00
discernment. You're already introducing them to Jesus when you are full of love and compassion
43:07
and not judgmental and skeptical and prideful and all of that. And that will
43:12
even and and and maybe they're not ready to receive Jesus as Lord yet, but maybe later on life they are. And now they
43:18
will not they don't they won't go to a church where this the pastor has a spirit of religion because
43:26
they know God through you through through the love that you showed when you planted that seed back then. Like
43:32
some of you, you're in the workplace and you're planting seeds every day and it's like a lot of seeds you planted and this
43:40
and maybe this person hasn't received Jesus yet, but they know you're a Christian. um it it's come up some somehow perhaps
43:47
or you know depending how open they were maybe you shared your whole testimony or maybe they just simply know you love to
43:53
go you love Jesus and you go to church maybe that's all they know but when they're experiencing Jesus through you
44:01
such love such compassion such kindness gentleness self-control
44:08
they are literally getting to know who Jesus is and they love him whether they they tell
44:14
you that or not, they're falling in love with him. And this is just a planting seed season,
44:20
but in the next season, they're you've like set them up to not be deceived by
44:26
by the spirit of religion. You set them up to recognize
44:31
who Jesus is like Jesus, like to go to the right church to to to, you know, to
44:37
to see the fruits of the Holy Spirit. It's powerful what you're doing just
44:43
when you plant seeds. And so, um, a lot of people they they tend to think, you
44:48
know, when they need to lead somebody to Jesus, I need and they're doing it like in a getting a notch on your belt way, a
44:54
performative way. This can be number one, it makes them feel like they like a
45:00
great Christian. It makes them feel good like accomplished or and and or it's making they want to
45:10
look impressive. They want to uh brag about it to others so they look really spiritual.
45:16
People can look up to them. Um that that's a thing in the old wine,
45:22
you know, and so that motive
45:27
it's not representing Jesus rightly. if you are coming like I got to get this
45:33
person to say the sinner's prayer like that's my end goal. Um
45:39
you're you're you're not representing Jesus rightly and most likely it's not
45:44
going to really be leading someone to Jesus. It could turn people away. it can be
45:51
seen for what it is because people are not stupid or not, you know, I mean they can they can see like when someone's
45:58
trying to convert them, when someone's being forceful, people can see that
46:05
that's a com people can tell like manipulation and forcefulness and you know they can see that. So um it's
46:12
dangerous to go with that wrong old wine motive. So the motive you should have
46:19
when you're spreading the good news, whether it's just like in your workplace, whether it's going out
46:26
evangelizing anywhere in public, have in your heart, I'm going to plant seeds
46:31
today and or water seeds, and I'm going to shine my light. I'm going to let
46:38
Jesus's love flow through me. And I'm going to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit
46:44
leading me to lead me how he wants to move through me to speak to people, to
46:50
touch people, to love on people. It's going to look different all the time.
46:56
It's, you know, you shouldn't go with this expectation. Okay, I'm going to pray for a bunch of people today as I go
47:02
out with the intention to evangelize. Okay, I'm going to um share my testimony to a bunch of people today. Don't go
47:10
with that intention. go with the intention of I'm going to shine my light and I'm going to be sensitive to the
47:15
Holy Spirit of how he wants to lead me. Some days you may not pray for anybody because people are not that open and you
47:23
are called to just plant seeds because you should not force prayer on anybody. The the the the
47:30
when you pray for someone, it needs to be in your spiritual domain, your spiritual territory. And what that looks like is when someone opens up in their
47:38
free will and um desires for you to pray for them.
47:44
And this will happen. These divine appointments will happen. This happened to me on my flight two days ago. There
47:52
was a gentleman who I was sitting um on the plane and a gentleman came into the
47:58
seat next to me and he was just so moved to just talk to me and he was just I
48:06
didn't like start a conversation at all. He's just talking and very soon he
48:12
starts just sharing how he just out of nowhere, no context, he just starts
48:17
sharing about a situation he h that an incident that happened in that morning that was
48:24
affecting him all day. And I'm telling you, there was no context to this at all. It was just it was this burden on
48:32
his heart and he felt moved to just share with me. um even though I wasn't, you know,
48:40
starting a conversation or anything, I was just just just sitting there, you know. And so he shares about how he um
48:48
that he went, I think it was to like a convenience store and the um employee
48:54
there just did not treat him well in terms of like good customer service. And
49:00
that really irked him, really offended him. I don't remember exactly what what the guy did, but um just wasn't good
49:08
customer service. And so he starts giving him like a piece of his mind cuz
49:14
he feels like it was rude. And then the worker uh responds negatively. I don't
49:21
remember the exact details, but he responds negatively um like rudely. And
49:27
so then the person sitting next to me, he says he he took two steps towards the
49:34
door. He was almost out the door, but then he felt he just wanted to teach him
49:40
a lesson um that there's consequences when you treat people rudely. And so he
49:47
like throws something in the store um down to the ground like making a scene
49:54
kind of and just goes out the door and he's just sharing with me how he's just
50:00
torn about it because he feels like you know he needs to he needed to teach him a lesson like justifying it. But then he
50:08
was like, "But I just I I I keep going back and forth like I don't know, maybe I should like go back and apologize to
50:14
him when I come back from this trip." And um I don't know. Like sometimes just
50:20
I I lash out in anger and I don't want to like I was closer to that door. I was two steps. I was I was even close to the
50:26
door. I didn't have to turn back. Like he's all of this. And I haven't shared anything about my life. I haven't shared
50:33
really I don't think even one thing. This was just coming, flooding out. And so I'm discerning in this moment. This
50:40
is a divine appointment. This is um hold on, I have to verify on TikTok.
50:52
This is not a coincidence. This is a moment where um God is leading me to
51:00
evangelize to him. I mean, share the good news. So after he shares that, I
51:06
said, you know, you can be free of that. You can be free
51:11
of that anger, of that rage. And um before I even shared that, I taught I
51:17
was telling him about loving enemies. Um the power of loving your enemies, the importance of loving your enemies and
51:23
not going eye for eye. Um and just just sharing in depth about that. Um I even
51:30
was sharing about my own personal experience and how um
51:36
how powerful like how powerful it is to be able to love your enemies because it
51:42
changes the world. It makes the world literally a better place where people
51:48
don't go eye for eye and people are more loving. I got to share how like I've
51:53
found that my example people are watching my example and people have shared with me like I didn't know this
51:58
was possible to love your enemies in this way and so now I've learned and I've transformed like seeing your
52:04
example and so I got to share with him like it's so powerful to love your enemies. It's it's so powerful to not go
52:11
eye for eye because and treat your enemies with kindness because it literally you're literally changing the
52:16
world. You're literally um teaching people to love and people will that's a
52:24
seed planted. It's really a seed planted where they will be encouraged to not go
52:30
eye for eye in the future and love their enemies. Um so yeah, but anyways I just told him about how um I'm seeing people
52:37
be free of all kinds of things including anger and rage and Jesus can actually free you. And um and then after I shared
52:45
that, he pretty shortly after said, "Could you like add me to your prayer list?" And I said, "I can pray for you
52:52
right now. I believe God will deliver you right now." And so I prayed for him right there as we were in the air.
52:58
And um you could just see like he was in awe because God was really pursuing him.
53:05
He said that he even was listening to Christian rap out of nowhere. It just popped up on his phone right before
53:11
getting on that plane. He also and then as I shared about 5F,
53:16
he said that he was actually headed to like an event that is literally located
53:23
like he says I'm going to this theater and he named the theater and he's like, "Do you know where that is?" I said,
53:29
"That's exactly right next door to where we have church." So he was just like, you could just see
53:36
the wheels turning and you could just see like God was pursuing him. And by the end of
53:42
the flight, he already had both of my books downloaded on his audio books and was excited to listen. I sent him the
53:50
deliverance and healing prayers. He shared about his dad who struggles with um I believe it was like diabetes and
53:57
like being overweight and just health problems. So I said, "Share this with your dad, you know." Um, but I just want
54:03
to share all that that example to just to give you an example of like how God
54:09
has these divine appointments set up. They're not going to be like every day looking the same. You know, that kind of
54:17
experience that I explained that doesn't happen all the time. Lots of times when
54:22
I'm on the plane, most of the times on the plane, it does not happen like that. But this was a divine appointment that God set up and it was so important to be
54:29
sensitive to the Holy Spirit. I actually um I'm I had a plan to be uh writing.
54:37
I'm I'm working on my next book. Hallelujah. And um I had the plan to be
54:42
writing on the whole entire flight. But like half of that the plans changed. So
54:49
you have to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit to let to to to be aware of how God wants to use you in a way you didn't
54:55
expect um to be a vessel of him. So in this situation, he was, you know, you could
55:03
just see that the light of Jesus in me, glory to God, was like
55:10
causing him to be attracted to just like share about the the the issues in his
55:16
life. Just just be open. And that was a very vulnerable thing to do. It just shows you even like the
55:23
the power of the light. The power of the light. Most people would not want to admit to things like this, you know. And
55:30
mind you, I hadn't opened up at all. Usually someone would, you know, you need to feel like you can trust someone.
55:35
I I don't think I said like anything cuz he was just like talking talking and just sharing this. So, um yeah. So, when
55:46
you see that happening, when someone's like opening up, you can know that this is an instance where God is really
55:52
leading you to do a lot. It's pro, it could be leading into praying for that person. By the way, the the the the the
56:00
airplane is not my spiritual domain. I can't just go and command demons to go
56:07
out of everybody who has a demon on the plane because people have free will.
56:13
When people come to my church, they have chosen in their free will to receive ministry through me. So I can command
56:20
demons to go out of anybody and heal this and pray healing for the sick because they have stepped into my
56:26
spiritual domain. That's how it works in the spiritual realm. So when you go outside of order, outside
56:32
of God's order, you open up doors to the enemy. It can be spiritually dangerous for you. So my spiritual domain and
56:39
territory was to minister was not the airplane. Was not the whole airplane. But it but but that gentleman that seat
56:47
where he was sitting in, that gentleman became my spiritual territory, became my spiritual domain. Um because he chose to
56:56
come to church in a way. He chose to open up and receive prayer through me by
57:04
me, the the power of God through me. Um, so
57:11
sometimes those instances will happen, but you need to really make sure you're not forcing them.
57:18
As you shine your light, people will be attracted. They will open up and they will ask for prayer. Or maybe they'll
57:25
say, "I really want what you have." Wow. When you share your testimony and then you can tell them, "Jesus can heal you,
57:31
deliver you right now. I could pray for you. Do you want me to pray for you?" and they may be like, "Yes." Um, or
57:38
sometimes it might not always look like that. Sometimes, um, just with the leading of the Holy Spirit, maybe
57:44
they're so interested in what you've received, maybe they need deliverance themselves, healing themselves. But
57:49
maybe the Holy Spirit in this moment will lead you actually to just share about the where to encounter God's
57:56
power. uh about like FFold church if you're planted at FFold church for example sharing with them the live
58:03
streams the uh in in in the physical location if you're in the LA area or
58:10
events are happening and an event's coming up um and giving them the deliverance and healing prayer.
58:16
Sometimes people will have high levels of demonic oppression that the anointing you carry
58:22
cannot is not high enough to deal with that. One of the biggest reasons that all were healed and delivered in the
58:28
times of Apostle Peter um where it says everyone who came under his shadow were healed and delivered. Same with Apostle
58:35
Paul in Acts 19:11. It says God was doing extraordinary miracles through the hands of Paul. So the people were
58:40
bringing handkerchiefs and aprons to his skin and um putting the handkerchiefs and aprons on the demon oppressed and
58:46
sick and they were being healed and delivered all of them. But it says extraordinary miracles, extraord not
58:52
just ordinary miracles, extraordinary miracles were happening through Paul. Paul and Peter carried highlevel
58:58
anointing as apostles as apostles and leaders in the body of Christ. They that
59:04
that that was part of their calling is to carry the highest level anointing.
59:09
They are the ones also that need to impart to the to the believers. So they need to have the highest level because
59:15
they are the ones to impart like how Elijah needed to have this highle anointing to impart to Elisha.
59:22
Same with Moses to Joshua. So one of the big one biggest reasons why all were
59:28
healed and all were delivered when they came under Peter's shadow when they were
59:33
touched with the handkerchiefs and aprons in the times of Paul. One was because of faith because they
59:39
believed. But two simply was because the anointing was so
59:44
high level that even principalities even the the the
59:52
strongest entanglement of demonic chains had to be broken and had they had to go. Every
59:58
demon had to go. Every high level demon had to go. Um so God works the same way today. He is
1:00:05
anointing present day Peters and a and Paul's. He's raising up in this revival
1:00:11
present day highly anointed servants of God for the equipping of the body of Christ and to deliver people of
1:00:20
highlevel demons and lower level demons alike. Um so it's it's important you are
1:00:27
sensitive to the Holy Spirit. Um, and you know, because sometimes a person,
1:00:32
and sometimes you can even know how they're talking, if they're saying like they've been super involved with witchcraft,
1:00:39
um, you know, just by how they're talking, sometimes you may discern that
1:00:45
they have a high level of demonic oppression.
1:00:50
and you carry anointing, but it's not your calling to cast out all of these
1:00:57
highlevel demonic spirits. So, in that situation, the Holy Spirit may lead you
1:01:03
with wisdom to invite them to church, to invite them to a live stream, to a videos where they can watch and God's
1:01:10
power can touch them. By the way, there's a healing and deliver deliverance and healing prayer on my YouTube. If you just type in Katherine
1:01:16
Crick or probably just even Katherine, my name um deliverance and healing
1:01:22
prayer. It's a 10 11 minute prayer that I have prayed as a general prayer for
1:01:28
anyone prophetic and general prayer for anyone who needs healing and
1:01:33
deliverance. So this is a great tool for you to share with anybody who who needs
1:01:38
prayer to introduce them to God's power as well. Um so yeah, so sometimes you
1:01:45
know that may be how the Holy Spirit's leading you. It doesn't have to look like every single time um
1:01:53
when someone opens up you pray for them. Many times it will. Many times this God
1:01:59
wants to demonstrate his power through you and that is a seed planted. They and maybe they need more deliverance. Maybe
1:02:06
God uses you to cast out one spirit, but they have more. This is the importance of telling them you you must be planted
1:02:14
at a church where God's power is. Tune in to these videos, for example, of where I am planted. Um, and also, it's
1:02:20
so important to learn the spiritual keys, the spiritual principles of how to receive complete deliverance and
1:02:26
maintain your deliverance. So many people they're they're using my book, Unlock Your Deliverance as evangelist tools because I've shared all these
1:02:33
different keys of how to receive complete deliverance and how to maintain your deliverance. I also have uh
1:02:38
teachings for free on my YouTube, how to receive and maintain complete deliverance. Um that can be shared with
1:02:45
everybody for free. It's a playlist on my YouTube page. Uh so so yeah, you have
1:02:52
to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and not put pressure on yourself, not um not
1:02:58
uh feel like you have to pray for someone if they are opening up, but be
1:03:04
sensitive to the Holy Spirit of how he wants you to lead them to God's power.
1:03:11
That's what's really important that you are leading them to God's power where they can encounter his power and fall in
1:03:19
love with him that their faith may rest on his power, not man's wisdom as Paul says, and that they may be transformed
1:03:27
by his power. Amen.
1:03:37
Um, one big thing I want to say is don't put pressure on yourself when it comes to
1:03:44
evangelizing, evangelizing and spreading the good news. Flow with the Holy Spirit. Flow with the Holy Spirit. Um,
1:03:52
you know, spreading the good news and evangelizing
1:03:58
it has to do with doing this. you you need to be doing this in a um
1:04:04
face-toface manner and a non-face to face manner
1:04:12
like what I mean is share videos on social media where it's it's it's very
1:04:18
easy you know it's not you're not that doesn't involve like going up to someone and talking to them and you know being
1:04:26
bold in that way it's it's still being bold sharing on social media of But that's not you're not having to be as
1:04:32
bold. But that's just as important. It's so important. And then there are times where the Holy Spirit is going to lead
1:04:38
you to talk to somebody. He's going to lead you to be bold.
1:04:44
You know, go up to somebody. But it's so important you're doing that not with old wine, not with um a performative
1:04:52
mindset, but really being led by the Holy Spirit. I'm just thinking to my in
1:04:57
my mind right now like there's actually like this story that's coming to mind of
1:05:03
um Rebecca, a woman who comes to 5F Church and like she was in Costco and she had
1:05:10
this intention of like I want to give unlock your deliverance to somebody. I I believe God has a divine appointment. I've come here with the intention. I'm
1:05:17
going to give it to somebody. Who should I give it to? And um if I remember correctly, like her eyes just went to
1:05:24
like this couple and they were kind of they they just like exchanged eye contact. Like they were both just kind
1:05:30
of like found themselves like just meeting with eye like they were kind of looking over, you know, just like
1:05:36
interested cuz she was currently like telling a different person about this book. like she was just telling someone
1:05:43
and then as she was doing that she noticed there was this just like it's like her light was shining and it was like attracting them and so because
1:05:50
there was this just like pull she just went over to them and said I think she
1:05:57
said something like hey I want to give you this book you know and they shared that they follow me and
1:06:05
they've been they're they live like an hour and a halfish I think away from 5F church in LA but they're like we want to
1:06:12
we've been really wanting to come. we've been really wanting to come and our and our ch their child had some um like uh
1:06:19
pro problems me mental problems and they've been really wanting to come but
1:06:24
they were under the impression that I because I travel a lot that I'm not there on Sundays but I'm actually there
1:06:31
every single Sunday even when I travel I'm always there at 55 church but they just didn't know that they just like
1:06:36
thought because I'm traveling and so she was able to tell them no come and they came that very week. Um, and I got I
1:06:45
prayed for them and their family and it was so powerful. Hallelujah. And so
1:06:50
that's just an example I I'm giving you right now. Like don't put pressure on yourself like you have to just like
1:06:55
randomly go up to somebody. Um, oh, I just have to I have to be bold and I have to go up to somebody like let the
1:07:02
Holy Spirit lead. Don't put pressure on it. So this is a situation where you could see you could sense she could
1:07:08
sense the Holy Spirit was drawing here and you can see this was a whole divine appointment set up and thank God she was
1:07:14
bold and went up to them like went up to them you know um so powerful.
1:07:23
So, uh, you know, and God God God absolutely uses when you just go up to someone randomly, too. Like God God can
1:07:30
use that as you shine your light and you show love. Like you you can't go wrong to just being like, "Hey, I just want to
1:07:36
I just felt moved to like share my testimony with you. Hey, I felt moved to share this to give this book to you. As
1:07:42
long as you're doing it with love and and kindness and compassion rather than like with this intention of performing
1:07:49
and I got to get a notch on my belt and I just got to do this and oh, this is really out of my comfort zone, but I just got to like do it and cuz I have to
1:07:56
do it. But if you're doing it with such love, like you renew your mind, I'm going to show someone love. I'm going to
1:08:02
be I'm going to be kind. I'm going to just just let the love of Jesus shine through me. so that they they really can
1:08:09
see Jesus in me. When you make that your intention, like you really can't go wrong even going up to anybody, you
1:08:17
know, um as long as you're you're being led by the Holy Spirit and doing it with gentleness and kindness and not
1:08:23
forcefulness, but compassion like cuz sometimes people may read it wrong and be like, "No, no, no, thank you." And so
1:08:30
just respect that. You don't have to be like, "No, wait, no, please listen to me." Like you can respect it, you know?
1:08:38
But um so so yeah uh so this that combination you know and I want to say
1:08:44
also there's some people that have um some some people that have a a strong gifting of an evangelist gifting.
1:08:51
There's some that are called to be evangelists uh as an office. Maybe they don't know it yet. Um they weren't called to that
1:08:57
yet. They weren't anointed as that yet. And they're going to have that natural gifting perhaps. Um, but there's going to be other people that are not called
1:09:03
to the office of evangelists, but they have an evangelist gifting. They have a great gift gifting of boldness as well.
1:09:10
Um, and it's going to come more natural to them. And what I want to say right now is like if that's you,
1:09:18
really lean into that because God is going to use you so powerfully in this way because a lot of people don't, not
1:09:24
everyone has that gifting. So really lean into that. Just make sure you're doing it in the new wine with the
1:09:29
teaching that I'm sharing. Um, but then on the other side, there's some people that don't have that natural gifting.
1:09:35
Now, we're all called to be bold. The more you surrender to God and obey him, the more he will put boldness in you.
1:09:40
So, we are all called to be bold. We are all called to, you know, in some way
1:09:48
go up to someone and be bold. Like, we should all do that in some way
1:09:55
sometimes. But um you don't compare yourself. Don't don't
1:10:02
like if you see people with this great gifting and passion for it, don't feel down on yourself and you know know that
1:10:10
some people have this gifting and it might not be your gifting but it doesn't mean that that gives you you should just
1:10:17
not even try to be bold. You you should just not even try to evangelize. No, you
1:10:23
you need to do this still. But at the same time, don't put pressure on
1:10:28
yourself to be exactly like those who have that more natural gifting. All
1:10:34
right? And so what I was sharing is we all need to be spreading the good news face to face in a very bold way, but
1:10:41
also like behind the scenes in a not face toface way. So what does this look like? We have flyers at 5F Church about
1:10:48
revival because this good news has to get out in any way possible. So God is
1:10:53
really calling you all revival warriors to be like the Samaritan woman at the well and have this passion burning in
1:10:59
you to share with as many people as possible this good news because the Bible says
1:11:05
how will people hear how will people hear if no one preaches
1:11:10
the good news? If no one shares the good news, how will people hear? There's so
1:11:15
many people who just don't know. There's so many people who don't know yet about revival, about really who Jesus is.
1:11:21
There's so many people who've only heard the old wine Jesus, not the real Jesus.
1:11:26
Jesus would who comes Jesus full of love and power. So many people in this world
1:11:31
do have not heard that good news yet and God needs you to go out there and share this good news to them. So we have
1:11:38
flyers at 5F Church. They say need a miracle and they share a bunch of different testimonies. They share a QR
1:11:45
code of our website 5fchurch.org and um share like social media so that people
1:11:51
can watch the videos and encounter Jesus. Um and so we have these flyers
1:11:56
available on our website right now 5fchurch.org. Um I think it's you can find out on
1:12:01
5fchurch.org/resources I believe it is link in my bio as well. Um and
1:12:09
I'm not sure if it's resources but it's I'm forgetting the exact name of it right now. 5church.org/flyier
1:12:14
perhaps. Um, but you'll find it on the homepage. You can scroll down or if you click on the tab, you'll see you you'll
1:12:21
be able to find it there. Um, but so so a lot of people right now, a lot
1:12:27
of the revival warriors around the world are going out either one by one, one person alone or in groups and and some
1:12:36
many small groups are going out together and sharing the flyers with people and
1:12:41
also putting them down places on public places. So like with the flyers for
1:12:47
example, it should be both like sharing them personally with people but also putting
1:12:52
them in public spaces. Both of them are powerful and needed. Um putting them
1:12:58
more in a public space doesn't require as much like boldness but it it's it's just it's very very powerful because
1:13:04
many different eyes can see one flyer like sitting in a public place for
1:13:09
example, you know. Um so what I'm trying to say is both are important and if you
1:13:17
find that you don't have this um huge gifting evangelist gifting like allow
1:13:24
yourself to be used by God still through putting the flyers out in public places
1:13:30
maybe not doing as many face to face uh handing them out but I also still
1:13:35
encourage you to uh push past fears and when the Holy
1:13:41
Spirit leads um share with share with people go up to people but but what I want to say is
1:13:48
like in this new wine take the pressure off and follow the Holy Spirit follow the leading of the Holy Spirit
1:13:55
don't allow the spirit of religion to condemn you don't allow the spirit of religion to um push you into performance
1:14:03
that makes you just not even want to share the good news that makes you just not even want to um join your brothers
1:14:08
and sisters and go out together maybe and share the good news. It's better that you go and and and and put them
1:14:15
down public places and don't hand them to a single person face to face than not go out at all. But not going out at all
1:14:21
to share the good news is what the spirit of religion will do. The spirit of religion will say, "You need to do
1:14:26
this. You need to do this. You need to get all these notches on your belt. You need to you need to do as all everyone
1:14:32
else is doing with these great evangelist giftings. you need to um go up to 10 people and and like it just
1:14:39
feels like so much pressure that you don't it makes you not even be motivated
1:14:46
to spread the good news. You see what I'm saying? So you have to be aware of that spirit of religion pushing you. Um
1:14:54
the Holy Spirit's gentle. So don't put that pressure on yourself, but at the same time
1:15:01
be courageous and strong and be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit to get out of your comfort zone
1:15:09
when the Holy Spirit leads. And as you do, you will see God use you mightily
1:15:15
and you will be amazed at at what Jesus does through your obedience. So it is
1:15:23
worth it. It is worth getting out of your comfort zone to lead someone closer
1:15:29
to Jesus and reveal his love. Amen.
1:15:35
Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:15:40
Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Uh thank you,
1:15:48
Lord. Praise God. Well, also I just want to
1:15:53
share about like order. If you are in a group of people that is um spreading the
1:15:59
good news, generally sharing the good news is just simply about like
1:16:04
just sharing the good news all around. It's not the same as like a church structure where there is me a message
1:16:12
there is a time of ministry. It is going running around into the
1:16:18
world like the Samaritan woman running around hear the good news. You know,
1:16:24
it's it's it's not like a church service. Like a church service, there needs to be like order and structure and
1:16:33
in this ministry time, you know what I'm saying? So when it comes to evangelizing if you're like in a group of people um
1:16:42
it you know it's not there's not so much this like structure it's just like having this heart for people and just
1:16:49
sharing the good news as the Holy Spirit leads you. You are all, you know,
1:16:55
reaching different people rather than a collective group just walking as a group and
1:17:01
like only one person out of the group just talks to somebody and the rest of you just smile and nod. Like when you're
1:17:08
going to when you're going out like spreading flyers for example, we want the good news to reach as many
1:17:14
people as possible. So be like the Samaritan woman at the well um and get
1:17:19
that good news out to as many people as possible. God will use each of you. Um
1:17:25
but if you're like in a small group for example and there's a leader the small group is with you and maybe you are in a
1:17:31
group maybe you are um eating dinner somewhere or something and like like uh
1:17:40
the wait the wait the waiter waitress or something like they start a conversation with you. They
1:17:46
see your light all of you and they end up like wanting prayer. then it would be
1:17:52
the right order to have like the leader of the small group um pray over that
1:17:58
person and um that using their authority in Christ um
1:18:05
in that in that way. So that's like the one exception if it's a circumstance like that. But generally um it's about
1:18:15
just going out and spreading the good news to as far and wide rather than being just like this this church
1:18:22
structure where you're like moving throughout the street or something if that makes sense. Hallelujah. Um praise
1:18:31
God. Well, thank you, Jesus, for this new wine that you have brought that
1:18:38
reveals your love and your power and leads people into true surrender. Hallelujah. I know through this
1:18:45
equipping, God is going to increase your light and it's time for the harvest to
1:18:51
be brought in in such a great measure like never before in this year of acceptance. I want to pray over you all
Prayer
1:18:58
right now. And if any of you, you know, you've you you you've struggled with
1:19:05
condemnation, you've struggled with being judgmental or even just people
1:19:10
being judgmental towards you and how that's affected you, oppression that maybe has come from that
1:19:16
or any kind of oppression. I encourage you to just renounce that right now. To speak that aloud to renounce right now.
1:19:23
And God is going to move in power and touch you and deliver you. He's going to come through the screen right now.
1:19:29
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
1:19:35
I speak right now that all of the old wine
1:19:41
that has came upon your life that has diminished your light in any way that
1:19:49
has led to the spirit of religion confusing you, deceiving you,
1:19:57
this this condemnation that's come in your mind. I declare all
1:20:04
of that condemnation, all of the spirit of religion must go in Jesus' name. And
1:20:09
I speak all of the all of the um wrong
1:20:15
thoughts towards God about who God is because of judgment
1:20:23
that's that that people have put upon you, stones people threw at you coming
1:20:28
as so-called Christians. I speak all of that wrong perspective
1:20:36
of who Jesus is. That that wrong perspective that God is
1:20:42
judgmental and has only conditional love. This must
1:20:48
go in Jesus' name. That wrong perspective must go in Jesus name. Now,
1:20:54
all of that hurt, that church hurt, all of that hurt of people judging you,
1:21:01
of people misunderstanding you, this must go now. All of that hurt, all
1:21:09
the oppression that came from that in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus.
1:21:14
Thank you, Lord. And I declare every spirit of religion that is holding you back from intimacy
1:21:20
with God, from surrender, from hearing God's voice, from from spending time in
1:21:28
the word and in prayer and serving God. The spirit of religion must go in Jesus'
1:21:35
name. And may all of these old wine ways that you have learned, may it come out. May
1:21:43
it come out now in Jesus name. And all of these things holding you back
1:21:50
from coming into the new wine, from learning,
1:21:55
it must go in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. And I detach you from
1:22:03
every demonic spirit that anyone has renounced right now. And I declare every
1:22:08
demonic spirit attached must go now in Jesus' name.
1:22:14
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. I declare all depression must go. All addiction must
1:22:23
go. All anxiety must go in Jesus' name.
1:22:28
I declare all heaviness must go in Jesus' name. I declare all thoughts of
1:22:35
death must go in Jesus' name. Thank you Jesus.
1:22:41
And I speak healing for every person here. For every prayer request you have
1:22:46
for any issue in your body or mind, I declare healing to you. I declare
1:22:52
sicknesses, diseases, pain. It all must go in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus.

1:24:39
really bad. I declare healing to you and I speak all of the pain to go right now in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus.
1:24:48
And I see someone right now. Um I see someone now. It was like many
1:24:54
years ago. And someone represented Jesus wrongly to
1:25:01
you. They came they came as such a Pharisee and it really put fear into
1:25:07
you. Like you were really afraid you were going to go to hell um because of this.
1:25:15
And ever since that day, you've had fear and you've had the wrong fear of God.
1:25:23
Like um like just afraid that you can't trust
1:25:29
God, afraid that God would let you down, afraid that you would mess up so bad that
1:25:35
your sin would not be forgiven for forgivable. This fear came in. So I
1:25:41
declare right now that this spirit of fear must go. This spirit of fear of
1:25:46
blasphemy in the Holy Spirit must go. This lie that you've blasphemed the Holy Spirit must go in Jesus' name. And this
1:25:55
fear of God letting you down. Fear of full surrender and taking away
1:26:01
your control, giving your control to God. This must go in Jesus' name now.
1:26:07
Thank you Jesus. I see someone right now that that this is when the panic attacks h started
1:26:14

1:27:14
compassion from now. May you see them with the love of Jesus. May you see them
1:27:19
with sheep without a shepherd and hunger for them to come into God's kingdom to
1:27:25
be planted at a church where there is an earthly shepherd for them to equip them to release God's power upon them and for
1:27:33
them to have the great shepherd Jesus as their father lord and savior. Let this
1:27:39
passion burn in your heart for people from now from every person for every
1:27:46
person in your life and strangers alike from now in Jesus' name. And I declare
1:27:52
great doors to open up now and divine appointments to take place where people
1:28:00
God has sent them to you to find the light of Jesus in you so that you may
1:28:05
lead them to Jesus. May your eyes be aware, your spiritual
1:28:11
eyes be aware of these divine appointments that God is bringing about. And may many, many people, many, many
1:28:17
people from social media, to the workplace, to your family, to strangers, to everyone in the world, my people
1:28:24
suddenly be drawn to your light. Let this light increase in you with this revelation that has come today. Let your
1:28:31
light increase. Let your light increase. And may it increase every day. And may
1:28:36
people be drawn to you. May you represent Jesus rightly. May love flow
1:28:42
through you mightily and powerfully. Jesus's love. Nothing but Jesus's love
1:28:48
in Jesus' name. May this anointing increase in you. I speak this anointing to come upon your life and increase in
1:28:54
you now. That the power of God would move through you and touch people. That
1:29:00
miracles would happen as you pray for people. and the fire of revival would
1:29:05
spread through you wildly in Jesus name.

I also have an eourse called Walking in Miracles. You can find that the link in my bio as well or at apostle.com.
1:41:34
I also want you to be aware of scammers if you're new here. There's many scammers and impersonators of me. So,
1:41:39
just be aware of people using my name and picture
1:41:45
on social media pretending to be me. The the easiest way to know it's me is that for all my social media pages except for
1:41:51
X, I have more than 200,000 followers. Most most
1:41:58
have quite a bit more than that. Um, we just reached 1 million subscribers on
1:42:03
YouTube last week. Glory to God. Uh, so
1:42:09
all of the scammers, they have way less than 200,000 followers. So that's the easiest way to know. Just make sure
1:42:15
you're looking at the actual follower count, not like in the bio or something. Um, and I will never DM you, private
1:42:23
message you, you know, saying I have a prophetic message for you, saying that you should sew a seed somewhere. That's
1:42:30
what the scammers do, not me. I will never comment on your comments on my
1:42:35
posts saying that I want to talk to you more or something like that and to message me here or email me here. I do
1:42:42
not do that. That's what the scammers do. I do not have Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, and I do not FaceTime people.
1:42:50
So, if you get messages, someone coming pretending they're saying they're me and any of those things or FaceTime, it's
1:42:57
not me. Uh, and I do not have any Facebook prayer request groups or any
1:43:03
groups on Facebook. I have zero groups, just my official pages.
1:43:11
No groups. So, if you're part of a Katherryn Crick group of any kind and
1:43:16
you're getting posts regularly on the group, you know, there's a difference on page between group and page. I think you
1:43:21
probably hopefully most of you know, but um that's not me. If you're part of a
1:43:27
group, so um yeah, and also be aware of
1:43:32
like AI like voice messages. I will not be sending voice messages. So, if it sounds like me a voice message, it's not
1:43:39
me. I'm not sending voice messages. All right. Awesome. Well, just be aware of
1:43:45
that. Let your let anyone know that you're sharing with about my ministry with them. Just just give them the heads
1:43:52
up so nobody gets scammed. Amen. Oh, for bookings also the o only bookings are
1:43:58
only done through my website 5fish.org or apostasick.com on the booking page,
1:44:05
booking tab form or the only email only
1:44:10
way to reach my ministry is through email besides those booking forms on our
1:44:16
official websites. Email is info@5fchurch.org. Info@5fchurch.org.
1:44:22
That's the only official email. So that's the only way any kind of booking has ever been done um for me to minister
1:44:30
anywhere is through that email or through those websites and that's how it will continue. So just be aware of
1:44:36
people pretending to be me reaching out to want to preach somewhere or something. All
1:44:43
right. Amen. Awesome. Um well I am so
1:44:50
excited for the subscriber Q&A tomorrow. I'm also so excited for church on Sunday. So, I will see all of you then
1:44:58
um in person or live. I can't wait. I have so much love for you all in Christ. And I'm so excited for how God is going
1:45:04
to use you mightily to be the light of the world, to lead people to Jesus, to
1:45:12
be a vessel of him in his power and his love. I'm excited for what God's about to do through you now after what God has
1:45:20
done and imparted to you today. So go out, shine your light. Spread this good
1:45:26
news with all of your heart with great urgency, excitement, and passion. Amen.
1:45:35
Amen. Keep shining. Keep planning. Amen.
1:45:41
