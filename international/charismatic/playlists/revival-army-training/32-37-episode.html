this book is called The Secret of the anointing accessing the power of God to
0:06
walk in Miracles and God instructed me to write this book because this
0:12
anointing that he's entrusted to me he wants me to freely release what has been
0:18
freely given to me to you all and this is many people don't know this but God
0:23
really wants to use all of you all of his children in the anointing which is
0:29
his power it says in the Bible all who believe these signs shall follow them they will
0:35
they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover they will cast out Devils demons
0:40
these are some of the signs so this shows us all who believe are supposed to be walking in the power of God
0:47
all who believe should be a true vessel of God not God just in talk but God in
0:53
power but it's there are Revelations and secrets
0:59
and keys and Mysteries of how to access the anointing and so God has revealed those to me and
1:07
that's why I've seen the fruits I've been able to see the anointing in my life and Ministry is not just that the
1:13
anointing just showed up but that God opened up my eyes and revealed to me how to access the
1:20
anointing how to be a vessel that God wanted to put the anointing in could entrust the anointing too
1:26
so that's what's in this book and so I know many of you have gotten it have
1:32
read it already if you haven't I highly recommend I encourage you and as your pastor Apostle
1:40
I urge you I instruct you this is homework get it get it and read it
1:48
it's very important and um we now have an audible version as
1:53
well where you can listen to it these are all online like on Amazon and everything and we have them in the back
1:58
as well but the physical copies but last week I began to teach a series now
2:07
of this book where I'm expanding Upon This Book expanding going in depth more
2:13
of the secrets that are released in this book amen so last Sunday I taught a message called effective in the
2:20
anointing so I taught how to actually be effective in the anointing if you didn't see that
2:26
message last week make sure you check it out it's on our YouTube channel If I Fall Church YouTube and my YouTube as
2:32
well so today um in in chapter three
2:42
chapter three is called the cost of the anointing and I am going to be teaching on one of
2:50
the areas of the cost so
2:57
for God to want to anoint you he has to trust you
3:03
and what God is looking for to see if he can trust you he's not looking for your
3:10
like credentials the number of years you've been a Christian if you've gone to Bible school
3:16
he's not looking at a checklist of religious activities he's looking at one thing
3:21
your heart
3:27
he can see your heart you can't hide anything from God he sees
3:33
and this is the one place he is looking he's not looking at how well you speak
3:40
he's not looking at what you look like how tall or short you are
3:45
he's not looking at your your friend group your connections
3:52
none of that only thing he is looking at is your heart
3:58
and he's he's looking for a heart that he can trust he's looking for a heart where he says I
4:06
know if I put this anointing here I can trust them
4:12
King David was one of the anointed Servants of God
4:18
chosen by God not chosen by man it wasn't like Saul when the people were
4:25
Desiring a king so much but this isn't what God wanted David was really chosen by God an
4:33
anointed vessel so David is a great example for us to look
4:38
at okay what did David have that got God's attention why did God choose David
4:45
amen so it says in
4:52
acts 13 22 that God raised raised up for them David
5:01
as king to whom also he gave testimony and said
5:07
I have found David the son of Jesse a
5:12
man after my own heart who will do all my will
5:21
so we get this like Insider information here of what God is looking for
5:30
he's not just choosing people randomly but we can really see through the
5:35
scripture what he's looking for and it says it right there I have found David the son of Jesse a man after
5:44
my own heart he will do all my will because he is
5:52
after my heart
6:01
this is the biggest secret I can give you
6:10
it's it's simple it's plain it's right there
6:17
God is looking for people who were actually after his heart
6:23
so that means not after their own heart right that's what that means
6:30
but after God's heart which means god what do you want
6:37
not what do I want what do I want to do with my life no God what do you want to
6:44
do with my life not what are my dreams no God what are your dreams
6:50
that I can be a part of helping come true
6:56
not what's my will no God what is your
7:01
will turning the attention from your own
7:07
desires to God's desires that's what me that's what being after God's heart really
7:13
means Matthew 22 36.
7:22
so so now we know okay God's heart is what we have to be after
7:29
what does that mean well
7:35
to be after God's heart it means
7:41
you want whatever he wants and that's where your mind and heart is every day
7:48
you deny your own selfish desires your own desires your own dreams your own will
7:55
for what God wants to have what God wants to do what God wants
8:01
God's greatest love language God's now
8:07
before I get to that when you're after someone's heart that means like you really love them so much
8:14
that you want to please them you when you are when you love someone so much
8:21
you're you're thinking what blesses them what makes them happy maybe you're in a
8:26
store and you're like I want to get something that they like for them rather than thinking I want to get something
8:31
for me you're you're thinking more about themselves than you right
8:38
and that it brings you so much joy because you love them so much it brings you so much joy to see their heart touch
8:45
to see them happy right that gives you more more joy even
8:50
than when you get something you want when you really love someone so much maybe that's your spouse maybe that's
8:56
your best friend maybe that's your child's right so that's how it should be
9:01
with God so what is God's love language meaning what
9:08
touches his heart the most what makes him happy the most how can that's how you can best show
9:14
love to him not not how you want to show love to God many people they have their routines and
9:21
they have their comfort zone of their relationship with God
9:27
like I have my routine of prayer and reading the Bible and worship and this
9:34
but they're not actually looking to God's heart they're they're loving how they want to
9:40
love God which God loves when you do all those things amen but we can't we can't just only be
9:48
thinking of how we want to show love to God but we have to really be looking at his heart what do you what is touching
9:53
your heart right now not what is the routine that I'm comfortable with that makes me feel like
9:58
I'm like I'm a good Christian no what do you want
10:04
so God's love language what touches his heart the most
10:09
is obedience obedience
10:16
that's what touches his heart the most so sometimes praying reading the Bible worshiping is obedience
10:24
sometimes doing something for God serving him in the church serving him
10:31
that's obedience and so you have to be in tune to what do
10:36
you want me to do right now God because I'm after your heart not after
10:41
my Christian agenda I'm after your heart
10:49
that's what touches God's heart the most obedience and we see we see let's go back to the
10:55
other scripture who will do all my will
11:01
that's what God cares about God sees when David is after my heart because he's looking after my heart and my heart
11:07
is that he will obey me he will be sensitive what does God want
11:13
now what is God's will I'm going to do it so therefore he will do my will
11:21
amen let's go to that next verse so
11:27
Matthew 22 36 teacher which is the most important commandment in the law of
11:32
Moses Jesus replied you must love the Lord your God with all
11:39
your heart all your soul and all your mind this is the first greatest commandment a
11:47
second is equally important love your neighbor as yourself
11:52
the entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two
12:00
Commandments so so so the disciples are asking Jesus
12:07
Jesus what touches your heart the most what's the very most important thing for us to
12:14
do they're going after his heart right now amen they're saying what's most important to
12:21
you what what are your heart's desires and he gives them the answer he gives us
12:26
the answer to love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul and all your mind
12:34
and the second one is equally important love your neighbor as yourself
12:40
now notice it doesn't say it doesn't say what are the that that
12:48
that they have to feel these things it says what are the greatest Commandments
12:53
so this is a commandment now feelings don't work by Commandments
12:59
a commandment means this is an action you you are doing an action God says to
13:07
do this so I'm doing this so that means that we we really can love
13:13
the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul all your mind we really can love your neighbor as
13:18
yourself you do not have to wait on your feelings to love
13:25
if this if these are really Commandments and they are well that's good news right
13:31
since feelings are fickle this is freeing a lot of people right now because you've been waiting on your
13:38
feelings because you want to do something you want to love God well you want to love people well but you don't feel like it lots of times and you feel
13:45
stuck you're like what do I need what do I do well this is the good news I'm telling you today it's not about your feelings you can do this God is
13:52
instructing do this and that means you can do it Hallelujah
13:58
[Applause] Hallelujah and so to be after God's heart is really
14:05
so simple it says the entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on
14:11
these two commandments so God is basically saying it's not complicated
14:16
don't over complicate it what will touch my heart all that I want
14:22
you to do are these things everything else will follow if you can focus on
14:27
doing these two things like every day that's your main
14:33
intention love God and love people every day oh you gotta worry about
14:39
that's all you got to focus on is that freeing it's so simple
14:44
the kingdom of God is simple the ways of Jesus are really simple
14:55
Hallelujah so love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul all your mind
15:02
and love your neighbor as yourself so
15:07
I've been through a lot of hard things I've been through a lot of persecution I've been through
15:14
just vicious attacks and back stabbing and lies made up against me false accusations that really hurt because
15:20
they were the opposite of what is true and all this was has been during was during a time where I was
15:28
really surrendered to God like never before and walking in obedience to God like never before so it stung extra
15:34
extra bad you know because I was living a life at that time
15:40
um sacrifice of sacrifice and and in that moment I was getting an
15:48
attack and hurt and false accusations which which really are painful and
15:54
when all this was happening when so much persecution was going against me and even to this day but I'm talking even
16:00
specifically in a in a specific time where it was extra hard where it was the
16:05
most persecution I ever faced and publicly
16:10
what kept me strong and what kept me going
16:16
was being after God's heart was
16:22
these two Commandments that I focused on I had focused on them for years at this
16:30
point so it became natural I didn't have to try hard I became transformed so it
16:36
was just natural and focusing on these two things
16:42
got me through it because God was calling me to persevere God was
16:49
calling me to minister to his people God had entrusted me with anointing to release to his people
16:55
and people needed Freedom people needed healing people needed salvation and God chooses to work through people through
17:02
vessels and so I'm going as I was going through persecution very difficult time
17:12
I was kept strong because when you're going through those hard times a lot of people struggle because they're
17:18
thinking of themselves they're thinking of how they look
17:24
they're thinking of how others see them they're thinking about oh my goodness
17:30
people are believing these lies about me I cannot stand this
17:36
they begin to think woe is me I'm doing all these great things
17:43
and and they're believing lies nobody's seen it they should be seeing what I'm
17:49
doing that Pride Creeps in when really we were called to be a man
17:55
or woman of no reputation like Jesus and to do everything for the audience of
18:02
one God and to
18:08
and Paul says if I were um trying to please if I were pleasing
18:14
men men and women I would not be a servant of God Paul actually says to be a true servant
18:20
of God you cannot please both people and God
18:27
so it doesn't that means it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter what people think
18:33
it doesn't matter lies that people believe in creepy ways they're thinking about you
18:39
thinking you're a witch or something thinking you've done things you haven't done all these creepy things does not
18:46
matter even one percent because all you care about is what God
18:52
thinks of you you are a man or woman after God's heart
19:04
you're after his heart so people can be saying these things about you looking at you weird way it doesn't matter you have
19:12
died to yourself you do not care what people think about
19:18
you God says they hated me so they're going to hate you
19:23
you will be hated it's no secret you will be persecuted this is part of it it should not
19:30
distract us or get us down this doesn't prevent us from fulfilling our purpose
19:35
and doing what God called us to do we just have to keep on going and ignore it
19:40
ignore what people think ignore what people say and deny our flesh that cares so much
19:47
about our ego and only be after God's heart
19:56
's heart that's where people get hung up they can't just be after God's heart they are after their own heart their own
20:03
image their own ego and they end up getting stuck
20:08
but if you can really die to yourself die to your flesh surrender everything lose your life as the Bible says
20:16
you will be able to stand strong you'll be able to not sin in that Temptation
20:21
through that attack sinning by trying to defend yourself
20:28
sinning by lashing out going eye for eye sinning by
20:34
not carrying the fruits of the Holy Spirit of humility of purity
20:42
but coming with pride and becoming offended
20:47
after God's heart you just see God your eyes are on me you're pleased with
20:53
me so I'm happy that's all I want
21:03
that's where God wants your eyes through all of that mess that happens through all of the persecution that happens
21:09
eyes on God so that's what I did that's what kept me
21:15
strong that's what kept me from uh you know going eye for eye to people when
21:21
people would speak against me from um defending myself and saying No this is
21:26
the person's true colors you know that's what kept me from doing all that
21:32
that's what kept me from kept me remaining pure and humble and full of
21:37
peace and joy and kept me strong to continue with the work that God's called me to do that's
21:44
the secret I kept my eyes after God's hearts
21:49
and I and I saw God's eyes proud of me I saw God's eyes saying I'm proud of you
21:56
I'm taking you through the fire and you are doing great keep up the good work I
22:02
saw him cheering me on I saw him being proud of me for going through something harder than I've ever gone through
22:08
before and and and I experienced a new kind of intimacy
22:14
a new kind of secret place with him because only he knows my full heart only
22:20
he knows the pain that I was going through I when I wasn't called to complain I wasn't called to vent I
22:27
wasn't called to God didn't want me to be doing those things to complain to vent and and and to to just honestly
22:34
just just talk about how hurtful this was no God called me to Speak Life
22:40
God called called me to keep the joy of the Lord so that means that I can't complain that
22:46
means I can't be speaking death I had to keep my eyes on Jesus and I gotta keep my mouth shut about
22:52
other people that are doing me wrong and so only God could see my heart only
22:58
God knew the pain because I couldn't really unfold it and all the way to anybody because he didn't
23:04
want me to amen he didn't want me to speak words of
23:10
death only God could see it so that was a new kind of intimacy and and and and that
23:16
was a the hardest thing I've ever gone through when I went through a period of of this deep persecution it was the hardest thing I'd ever gone through
23:22
it was the very hardest thing I've ever gone through and so to obey God when it was the
23:30
hardest season ever brings a new level of intimacy because when you can hear God accurately just by
23:37
Renewing Your Mind you can you can see that God sees and he's proud
23:43
he's proud of you in a new level prouder than before because you're doing
23:48
something harder that you've never done before for him so I kept my eyes there after God's
23:55
heart and received his love received his words of encouragement received his his pride
24:02
over me that helped me to maintain my peace even through tears that helped me
24:09
maintain my joy of the Lord that helped me be strong and keep on doing what he
24:15
was calling me to do when the feelings wanted to just relax take a vacation go
24:22
away but he was calling me to keep going forth and work hard
24:28
for him that's what kept me strong was being after his heart keeping my eyes on him
24:35
on his heart how does God want me to speak how does God want me to react to this
24:43
what do you want Lord oh you want me to be quiet oh you want me to speak with with uh
24:50
compassion towards my enemies with kindness towards my enemies
24:56
you want me to bless them constantly looking after his heart through all of that hard time
25:04
moment to moment day after day be after his heart that's how to stay pure in the heart
25:11
that's how to be obedient and keep the fruits of the Holy Spirit
25:17
and not give in to that sin of speaking words of deaths speaking against people and being offended let your heart get
25:23
all riled up and get angry and get offended that's how being after God's heart
25:31
Hallelujah and that that's what God's looking for
25:37
because the devil wants to stop you in your tracks when God anoints you when
25:44
God pours the anointing on you you're gonna face attack like you've never faced before that I'm speaking from
25:51
experience I couldn't even dream of that attack that I was facing I'm glad that
25:56
my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jordan who's definitely seized and definitely saw it was coming and he's been through it so he knows I'm glad he didn't tell
26:04
me exactly how bad it was going to be because I could have given up I could have lived in dread
26:09
but when I walk through it I maintain my peace and joy because I kept my eyes on
26:16
God it was worth it it was worth every second of it
26:22
Hallelujah there is Victory there is reward there is increase of anointing
26:29
[Applause] so I don't mean to scare I just I'm just saying it gets real
26:37
I'm not gonna lie to you that it gets real uncomfortable it's unfair
26:43
God is a god of justice but God's a God of Justice in his timing I
26:50
have learned a God of Justice in his timing not in
26:58
your timing you want Justice now the next second or at least the next day come on at least
27:04
the same year nope he's a God of Justice in his time look
27:10
at look at Joseph was in the pit he was in the prison he
27:16
was as a slave this would happen for years until the Vindication came
27:24
David was chased for quite a while by Saul quite a long time until Vindication came
27:29
for him Justice came for him God is a God of Justice though he is a
27:34
God of Justice [Applause] but it's in it's it's it's indeed in his
27:41
timing so that's that's part of the really difficult part of it that that's the part where you Gotta Die
27:47
to yourself and die to what people think about you because you can have people be thinking the wrong thing about you for a
27:53
long time you got to learn to just die to yourself and not care and just be after God's heart
28:00
get used to being hated get used to being misunderstood
28:05
it does not matter because we are only after God's heart
28:12
so once you're anointed once God trusts trust you with the anointing that that you see how powerful the anointing is
28:19
the anointing is the most dangerous thing to the devil's Kingdom the most dangerous
28:25
it's what the devil hates more than anything because it's the only thing that can destroy his kingdom the the anointing destroys the yoke
28:32
the anointing we could also say the anointing destroys demons the anointing destroys
28:37
all the works of the devil the anointing destroys the devil's Kingdom
28:43
same thing [Applause] but but nice preaching with no power does
28:50
not destroy the devil's Kingdom praying with all your might and and power but not by the spirit
28:57
will not destroy the devil's Kingdom the anointing is the only thing that
29:04
destroys the kingdom so when you actually carry the anointing the devil means serious business about
29:11
trying to stop you in your tracks and take you down and so he will for sure send attacks and
29:19
the the big ones come in the forms of persecution through other people we as
29:25
humans tend to care about our ego so much
29:31
that's why the Devil comes in this way because he knows he knows how hard it is for Humanity
29:40
to be human be humble and be of no reputation
29:47
so he comes in this persecution area using people to speak against Servants
29:53
of God to speak lies to make up things to twist things
29:59
because he knows it hits the weak spot
30:04
ego Pride
30:10
and he's the devil's looking for you to sin I mean he's looking for you to sin in
30:15
this area this gun that's going to Halt the anointing growing in you slow you down you can repent and God can continue
30:23
to pour in you you know but it's the purity of heart that releases
30:29
the anointing the purity of heart the humility child
30:35
likeness humility when we say pure that's what we mean that's what we mean humble
30:42
just wanting God's will I don't care about anything else about
30:48
what people think of me I don't care about my dreams I just want God's will that's that's purity
30:53
purity of heart that's what God is looking for that
30:59
purity of heart that's what releases the anointing that's when God will pour out powerful
31:04
anointing on someone when the purity of heart is there so
31:10
the devil wants to find Pride remaining bring it to the surface
31:16
so you can the pride that you were hiding before you can now act on act prideful act offended and not show
31:25
the fruits of the Holy Spirit of humility and Purity and love
31:31
so this is why we have to be after God's
31:37
looking for this are they after my heart have they laid down their ego
31:43
I need that to be there God is saying because when I pour that anointing the testing is coming
31:49
the testing is coming and I don't want them to be prideful to
31:56
um to not show the fruits of the Holy Spirit and misrepresent me and fail the
32:03
test before he can start to pour out the anointing he needs to see this
32:09
because he know you won't pass the tests and he's he continues to look for this he continues to look for more of this
32:16
this purity of heart that you don't care what people think you just care what God thinks he'll test
32:21
you in this again and again and again so we can pour out more and more and more it comes out little and then he tests
32:26
you and sees how you handle it will you be humble will you be pure
32:32
or will you care what people think and then you you pass the test and then and then he pours more and then he brings
32:38
another test and it's a it's a harder test but but but he's transformed you more so
32:44
so you can pass it but is that it's really that big same test
32:50
these are the biggest tests these are the biggest kinds of tests there's other tests that God will take you through in terms of uh the refining period so we
32:58
can pour that anointing in you and continue to pour more and more but these are the big ones the big areas
33:03
amen Hallelujah [Applause]
33:11
so what is God's greatest passion to so to be after God's heart what does that mean
33:18
well what is God's heart what is God's passion was he passionate about
33:24
what does he love the most it's yeah you got it
33:29
his people it's not hidden it's clear he's made it clear his heart
33:34
he loves his children his biggest passion is to see the people on this Earth our
33:43
friends our family and our strangers from every nation young and old
33:49
he wants to see them know his love he wants to see their eyes open up to
33:54
his love he wants them to meet him he wants them to be saved
34:02
he wants salvation for them he wants the The Works of the devil to be destroyed
34:07
in their lives he wants freedom and healing for them
34:14
that is God's very simple heart that's God's whole heart his people his love
34:22
for his people so people people are like
34:30
there's so many Christians that are forgetting the second commandment that
34:36
the Bible says is equally as important as the first if you love God you have to
34:41
love his people and really love his people and not just love the people that are easy to love
34:50
[Applause]
34:56
Matthew 5 43 you have heard the law that says love your neighbor and hate your enemy
35:03
but I say love your enemies pray for those who persecute you and that way you
35:08
will be acting as true children of your father in Heaven for he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good
35:13
and he sends rain on the just and the unjust the like if you love only those who love you what reward is there for
35:21
that that's not hard God's saying even corrupt Tax Collectors
35:26
do that much so in other words even ungodly people can love people who are
35:32
easy to love if you con if you are kind only to your
35:37
friends how are you different from anyone else even pagans do that
35:43
but you are to be perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect
35:49
this is what loving people means there's people out there who are far
35:57
from God there's people out there who do evil things they've done evil things to you but guess what God still wants you
36:03
to love him God still loves them
36:09
and it's not your job to judge them it's not your job to be the judge it's not your job to uh to punish them it's not
36:17
your job to make them see their wrongs it's not your job to make sure they reap what they're sowing you have only one
36:25
job upon that person's life upon your friends and your enemies lives the
36:32
people doing evil to you and others lives you have one job to love them
36:38
that's your one job to love them hallelujah amen
36:45
it is very simple and if we could just do this every day
36:51
make it Our intention this is all that God wants me to do to love him and to
36:56
love his people meditate on that renew your mind again and again love God and
37:02
love people be after his heart care what he thinks about care what he wants me to
37:07
do care about his dreams and love his people that's his heart that's what he's
37:12
passionate about I want to adopt my father's heart
37:17
I want to adopt my father's heart I want to care about the things that he cares about and that's his people I want
37:25
to love his people can you have that kind of prayer instead of praying for your own selfish desires instead of
37:31
praying for for your enemies to get what they deserved
37:36
can you pray that kind of prayer instead of praying for Vindication for yourself
37:42
can you pray that kind of prayer God I want to love your people all kinds of your people you want me to love my enemies God I
37:49
want to love my enemies help me help me love you and help me love my enemies Lord
37:58
so this is how you get this heart is Renewing Your Mind with this
38:03
and how complicated you don't got to go to Bible school for this
38:09
love God love people this is why God is using the weak and
38:16
foolish things he doesn't need all the fancy stuff he just needs some he needs somebody to be
38:22
after his heart to really love him truly love him and truly love his people
38:28
that's all he's looking for so simple and so when I've had people do evil bad
38:34
things to me I've renewed my mind they are a beloved child of God and Saul did
38:42
even worse things than what this person is doing to me Saul who became Paul he killed many
38:48
Christians not just anybody but Christians so he was literally actively trying to stop the work of God just like
38:54
people do to me but he took it a step further and actually killed them he
38:59
actually did stop the work of God through those vessels and God would then have to raise up other vessels
39:05
like he did worse than what these people are doing to me they're doing bad things to me but he
39:12
did worse but yet God still loved him so much that he wanted to redeem him he wanted to
39:18
open his eyes he wanted salvation for him he wanted Deliverance for him and he
39:25
took it even further he even wanted to use him for his glory he wanted to he wanted to bring people into the kingdom
39:31
through Paul even and it is crazy it goes even crazier than that he wrote
39:36
most the New Testament he's the only one that was walking in extraordinary Miracles the Bible says Acts 19 11. so
39:44
he's like he ends up being honored the most out of all the disciples
39:50
that's God's heart for Saul before he came Paul so I renew my mind I want to have God's
39:58
heart for this person that's doing wrong to me if this is God's heart for Saul so this
40:04
is absolutely God's heart for this person I can do this I can love this person
40:10
and so automatically if you start to renew your mind you will you will stop thinking about
40:17
wanted to speak against them going eye for eye you will be peaceful you will start you
40:25
will even have this strength to say I bless them I bless them I don't want them to reap
40:30
what they're sowing because that's really bad I don't want that for them I want Redemption I want salvation for
40:37
them I want Deliverance for them I even want God to still be able to use them
40:42
because I'm after God's heart and the more hands on deck the more Warriors in
40:47
his Revival Army the more people will be saved healed freed
40:52
that's God's heart that's my heart I adopt that heart and so I truly want
41:00
everyone to be able to be redeemed so more hands are on Deck so more people can be saved
41:06
you just renew your mind with that and you ask God to help you amen
41:13
that's this is what number two I was saying what what really got me through
41:18
hard times of persecution the hardest attacks what kept me strong kept me going was
41:25
being after God's heart and just loving him and and only carrying what he thought
41:31
and obeying him but number two was the second commandment part
41:37
to love people God was calling me to continue to
41:43
minister a rigorous schedule when this intense persecution was coming against
41:48
me actually I was ministering internationally for the first time and it was every single week I was getting
41:55
on a plane Sunday after church after I ministered and I was ministering one to
42:00
even three days sometimes like in the Netherlands I remember I did that other countries like three days at a time
42:07
and then flying back on a Saturday and preparing for service Sunday and ministering at church that Sunday and
42:13
then doing it again the next week so I was doing this having this rigorous schedule through all of that
42:20
but what kept me strong and kept me going and kept me not even considering
42:25
giving up or taking a break when God wasn't asking me to was my love for people
42:32
the adapting God's heart to love his people because God had called me to be a vessel
42:39
of the anointing to release this anointing to bring Salvation healing and deliverance to his people God chooses to
42:46
use vessels the biggest way that the salvation healing Deliverance comes the main way is through vessels
42:52
and so I know that God was counting I knew that God was counting on me I knew that if I didn't show up that
42:58
people wouldn't be set free and so God had molded my heart I'd by
43:05
going after his heart where I loved God's people and I saw their pain
43:11
and I saw their bondage and I knew God pained for pains his
43:17
heart was pained that his children were in bondage and sickness by the devil
43:23
and I knew that God wanted to use me to deliver them and heal them and release his anointing so that Isaac could open
43:29
up to his love and they could be saved they could surrender and so I kept my eyes there
43:36
it doesn't matter what I'm going through I'm going through hard times but all that matters is is that I love God and I
43:43
love God's people so I'm going to focus on loving God and loving God's people so my love is making me be strong and
43:49
continue to minister this trumps the pain I'm going through
43:56
the hard times I'm going through the desires the feelings that I have of just wanting to go home and cry and take a
44:03
break and take a vacation or do something fun or something to get my mind off of it it trumps at all the love
44:09
for people I want to see them free I want to see them healed I want to see them saved
44:17
that's that's the secret of what got me through that's the only thing that could have gotten me through that's the only
44:22
thing that can get you through persecution and these fiery trials attacks of the devil that God allows
44:29
this is the only thing that can can make you strong so you don't give up is to be after
44:36
God's heart to love him and love his people amen
44:48
second second Timothy 3 verse 3.
44:54
some people they will be unloving and unforgiving they will slander others and have no self-control they will be cruel
45:01
and hate what is good they will betray their friends be Reckless be puffed up
45:06
with pride and love pleasure rather than God they will act religious
45:13
or another translation says they will have a form of godliness
45:19
but they will reject the power that could make them Godly
45:27
stay away from people like that these are the people that God can never
45:32
trust with anointing these are the people many times that
45:37
want the anointing so badly these are the people the Christians the
45:43
so-called Christians that don't really surrender everything
45:48
that don't deny their flesh deny their ego and do not humble
45:54
themselves and to be real with you there's a lot of Christian Christians
46:01
like this to be honest with you this is one of the
46:09
reasons why the anointing is rare God cannot put anointing there
46:15
and to be honest because this has been so prevalent this state of heart here that this is talking about
46:22
it's become so common and acceptable that the standard in the body of Christ
46:27
is not very high for purity Purity in the heart
46:34
humility it's become acceptable
46:39
people hide these secret motives they hide their agendas
46:47
and this is being the opposite of being after God's heart
46:54
and this is what's got to change in the body of Christ this is what God is doing now as he's
47:00
purifying his bride [Applause]
47:08
and I'm asking you all to to raise your standard in your own lives in your own heart raise your standard of purity
47:15
don't be like this don't accept this anymore maybe most of the Christian friends and
47:22
family you've had are like this that doesn't make it okay go higher
47:29
raise the bar God needs you God wants to anoint you
47:36
and this is not the way this doesn't bring glory to God
47:42
and you cannot hide this from God you cannot fool God
47:48
you can fool people you can fool Christians but you cannot fool God
47:56
amen Hallelujah so I God is asking you right now to
48:03
raise the standard in your own heart that you wouldn't accept these things that you would you wouldn't accept these
48:09
impurities and selfishness and he's also asking you to not accept
48:15
this in leadership not accept this from your teachers
48:21
he's asking you to raise the bar
48:27
there must be humility there must be no offense
48:32
there must not be eye for eye in my heart in my Leader's heart in my
48:38
Shepherd's Heart in my spiritual mother or Father's Heart or that's not where God's calling me
48:49
there must not be this hatred of other people there must not be a a hatred and
48:55
and and and backstabbing and and speaking against people who do you wrong there must be love for the enemies
49:02
that's what God's called us to we must love our enemies our leaders must love their enemies
49:10
they got the most the most difficult enemies but I don't care they have to love their enemies
49:16
we gotta love our enemies this is what God has called us to
49:22
we have to raise the standard in the body of Christ it's unacceptable
49:28
we gotta love everybody it's not difficult with God's strength and power
49:40
second chronicles 16 9. well actually Jeremiah 17 10 let's look at this one first I the Lord search all hearts and
49:48
examine secret motives I give all people their due rewards
49:54
according to what their actions deserve I give anointing I entrust anointing and reward and blessing
50:00
when I see that they can be trusted with it I see their motives are pure
50:08
the Lord searches all hearts and examines secret motives you can't hide from God stop trying to hide from God
50:15
it's not gonna work he can see everything everything
50:23
second chronicles 16 9 the eyes of the Lord searched the whole earth in order
50:28
to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him I'm gonna say that again listen to this
50:34
carefully the eyes of the Lord searched the whole earth in order to strengthen those heart those whose hearts are fully
50:42
committed to him the eyes of the Lord searches the entire
50:48
Earth looking for hearts that are after his
50:56
and what does he do when he finds those hearts he strengthens them
51:08
[Applause] some of you have not seen this high standard of Purity in the heart before
51:16
and so what you think is you think it's impossible to really be fully committed to the Lord
51:21
to really have a pure heart you haven't seen the example you probably haven't maybe you haven't seen an example in
51:27
leadership and you yourself you struggle with
51:32
impure thoughts and so you feel like this is impossible but the word of God says that if your
51:39
heart is truly committed to him he will strengthen you the the verse we just read before it
51:46
says these people have a form of godliness but deny the power that could help them
51:53
become Godly
51:58
God does not make it difficult to have a good pure heart and to really love
52:04
people but you have to first want it and you have to surrender to God that's
52:10
the first step you have to truly from the depths of your heart say Lord I love you you've
52:16
given me everything and you're asking me to give you my life
52:21
and I want to give my life to you I Surrender everything I Surrender my dreams I Surrender my
52:30
will I Surrender my motives I Surrender everything I want to lose my life right
52:36
now so that I can truly find life in you so you can make me a new creation so you
52:45
can come in and have your way and mold my heart to be like yours you have to
52:50
make that decision to really legit surrender to God real surrender mean it
52:57
from the depths of your heart mean it and know what that means know
53:02
that that means that you're legit giving up your dreams you're giving up your motives you're
53:08
giving up your selfish Ambitions you're letting God take it so if all of you if you are on board for
53:15
that I want to tell you some good news God's found a heart who's truly
53:21
committed to him but some of you saying yeah that's my
53:28
heart but I battle all the time with impure thoughts and motives
53:33
and feelings have you forgotten some of you I've
53:39
taught this many times by now you need to remember you need to take the word of God seriously have you forgotten you're in a spiritual war
53:46
have you forgotten that the one of the biggest ways the Devil Comes is in your thoughts and in
53:51
your feelings and your the thoughts and feelings you're having are not always you the thoughts and feelings that are you
53:58
are the ones you allow to stay and fester and remain and you act on
54:05
those are your thoughts and desires and that's not a heart that's fully
54:10
committed to God and that's the heart that that verse talks about these people have a form of godliness but they deny
54:17
the power but if you can do what the word of God says submit to God
54:22
surrender to him want to please him be after his heart follow his principles which includes
54:29
planning yourself in a church where the power of God is so you can receive that power to help you become Godly
54:39
if you can surrender to God follow his principles receive the anointing in your
54:44
life you will reject the devil you will
54:49
reject his lies I don't want to be jealous I reject it I don't want bad to happen to that person I reject it I
54:57
don't want to compete with that person I reject it I don't want to be envious of that person I reject that thought
55:03
I don't want to obsess over this selfish motive I reject it
55:09
I don't want to obsess over these dreams that are good dreams but I know they're not God's dreams I reject it
55:16
I don't want to have these impure sexual thoughts towards people I shouldn't be having them towards I've rejected
55:23
I don't want to have those impure sexual dreams I reject it I don't want to have these sneaky
55:28
schemes to manipulate people and get my way I reject it
55:36
because this is the truth some some of you are being hunted by the devil with impure motives and thoughts I know it
55:42
because of what did I say what makes the anointing come is purity of heart
55:48
so the closer you come to the anointing the more serious you are about God and you are serving him now you are serving
55:54
him now you are coming every week you are taking it so seriously the devil is going to hunt you
55:59
for many people he's going to hunt you in the area of purity he's going to send strategic
56:06
thoughts and feelings that are not your own you don't want to have
56:12
but he's gonna send them hoping you will give into the Temptation
56:17
and forget the spiritual principle and accept the power of God to resist the devil and he must flee and you receive
56:24
the anointing to be transformed
56:29
so first of all some of you need to be free right now be free be free of feeling condemned for the
56:35
impure motives of thoughts and feelings you're having if you don't want them there they're not
56:41
yours but you need to grow up and do something about it accept the power of God to be
56:48
transformed and do the spiritual principles God's commanded you to do submit to God reject the devil and he
56:56
must flee
57:01
some of you need to stop being victims stop playing victim
57:07
stop feeling bad for yourself stop having a pity party
57:12
and renew your mind of what you have learned and put it into practice
57:20
submit to God reject the devil renew your mind this is not me I don't want
57:27
these thoughts I don't want these feelings devil you're a liar you must flee
57:36
and this is a principle he must flee so some of you you need to stop
57:42
stop letting the devil take over stop denying the power
57:48
that God's giving you you have the authority over all powers of the devil you you are receiving the anointing here
57:54
to help you and and this is what happened so the
58:01
Bible says can we go back to that verse about denying the power of they deny the power of God
58:08
they will act religious but they will reject the power that could make them Godly
58:14
they will the other translations they say they they have a form of godliness
58:19
but deny its power they have a form of godliness but they will reject the power that
58:25
could make them Godly so it's very simple if your heart is I
58:31
want to be after your heart I want to love God and love people above everything else I don't want any
58:37
impurity I don't want any jealousy I don't want any wrong motives I don't want that I have those thoughts I have
58:43
those things but I don't want it that's not you you have a heart that's committed after God have confidence in
58:48
that and know that you're in the process of being transformed you're you're in the process of of
58:55
becoming Godly and having this heart that's so strong in Purity that you
59:01
don't even have those thoughts and feelings anymore because you've overcome the Devil he's not allowed to come attack in that way
59:08
and you're so much like Jesus that you start to feel like Jesus so so so be so
59:15
becoming like God you don't always feel like how God feels right away like you'd always feel intense love for
59:23
his children and your enemies right away that's okay though but God's still
59:28
seeing you as Godly and pure and not sinning but you're in this process of
59:35
transformation but as you keep going and accessing God's power and applying his principles continuing to surrender renew
59:41
your mind every day I'm after God's heart rejecting the devil's lies this amazing thing happens where the
59:49
power of God literally makes you Godly in every area even your feelings you become more like God even in your
59:55
feelings day by day you keep doing this and you'll start to really feel like God
1:00:02
you won't feel jealousy towards people anymore you won't feel this impurity
1:00:07
anymore you've become so much like God that every part even your feelings are
1:00:12
like good Hallelujah
1:00:18
and that's where you become powerful because the devil can spit in your face and you can smile
1:00:26
you know like yeah literally I've been spin the face by demons before don't let it get to me
1:00:31
but people can spit in your face people can speak so bad about you but your heart is so much like God that you're
1:00:37
not shaking you're not having to do that work of I'm gonna love people oh help me love people God
1:00:43
but you you become more Godly because you've accepted God's power you surrender every day you're after his
1:00:50
heart and so now they they hurt you and you don't even feel bad in your heart towards them
1:00:57
is that amazing is this good news it gets better there's reward there's
1:01:04
reward there's reward for serving God Hallelujah
1:01:09
amen amen amen God is God has called all of
1:01:15
you to be Warriors in this revival Army to be among the very first of millions
1:01:22
to be leaders this means that he wants to entrust you with anointing with a lot
1:01:27
of anointing he wants to entrust you with as a leader he wants to entrust you
1:01:33
with responsibility much more even than you have right now this is the truth this is the beginning of the end time
1:01:39
Revival and it's going to reach Millions across the world this is the truth God has brought you
1:01:45
here because he wants to entrust you with a lot so you got to do this you got to take
1:01:52
this seriously if you want to be used by God or he's going to choose somebody else the Bible says many are called but few
1:01:58
are chosen you are being called right now and you're being tested right now to be chosen and it's not that difficult
1:02:06
it's very simple what I'm telling you but you got to make this simple this simple way of living your life
1:02:13
this simple way of being after God's heart loving him loving his people your life all that you care about
1:02:21
die to yourself lose your life so you can find it
1:02:28
amen amen Hallelujah
1:02:33
praise God praise God thank you Jesus
1:02:38
thank you Jesus Hallelujah amen God is so good amen
1:02:44
I know so many of you are freed today God brought this message on time because some of you
1:02:50
were starting to get down with impure thoughts
1:02:56
they're not you they're not you let's take a moment right now to be free of that right now
1:03:01
amen God's Gonna free you right now he's gonna free every one of you who have
1:03:07
felt down who felt I am not pure because of the thoughts and feelings I am having
1:03:13
so if that's right now I just want everyone to surrender fully to God I'm
1:03:19
not going to force everybody anybody this is this is your own will your own choice but I'm going to encourage you
1:03:25
this is the best decision of your life just lets everyone stand right now
1:03:30
this is the best decision of your life to surrender your entire life to God remember this means everything these
1:03:36
these aren't just words you need to know what's real surrender means this means your Ambitions your dreams
1:03:43
your will the things you want so badly it means everything it means even good Godly
1:03:50
dreams I had a good Godly dream of being a singer as my calling but that wasn't
1:03:57
God's dream for my life it was to be an apostle and to plant five-fold Church
1:04:04
so even the good good Godly pure dreams that you have
1:04:09
Give Them All to God some of you have dreams of of marriage
1:04:14
