well today I'm going to share with you how to hear
0:05
God's voice Hallelujah are you excited
0:12
to learn how to hear God's voice God is speaking
0:17
he's speaking he's speaking always he is speaking
0:23
he's a spirit though so we have to learn spiritually how to hear his voice and
0:28
how to discern his voice we're used to hearing things just physical wise we have to learn how to
0:34
hear spiritually with our spiritual ears amen
0:40
about a month or so ago I shared a message on how to have a relationship with God if you didn't see that you can
0:46
search that on our YouTube I encourage you to watch that and today we're going to go even more in depth
0:51
with how to hear God's voice as you have a relationship with God the first way to hear God's voice is in
0:58
the word of God the Bible the Bible says in John 1 it says that in the beginning was the word and the Word
1:04
was with God and the Word was God the word is God the Bible the word is
1:12
100 God's words amen
1:18
and so this is our foundation of hearing God's voice this is our
1:24
foundation this is where we must start
1:31
when you read the word of God when you read it with the Holy Spirit not reading like a textbook but if you
1:38
sit down with the word of God and you surrender to God and you invite
1:43
God in you say God I want to hear from you speak to me Lord I'm not just doing this out of a
1:51
religious routine I'm not doing this to make myself like feel like a better Christian because it's not about
1:57
performance amen but it's about relationship with
2:02
God and actually hearing his voice but if we get into a religious routine about it or if we have that religious
2:09
mindset performance mindset like if I read two chapters a day then I know I'm doing
2:17
good as a Christian we're actually blocking God's voice because we are coming religiously
2:24
in the Pharisees they were full of religion they couldn't hear God's voice at all
2:30
they knew the word of God so well they read the word of God all the time they knew it in and out but they weren't
2:36
actually hearing God's voice as they read the word of God because they were coming religiously
2:42
they were coming with performance so we can't come that way or else we
2:49
won't hear God's God's word we can become like Pharisees and use God's word against the actual work of God that's
2:56
what the Pharisees did when we're not hearing God accurately through the word of God so it's
3:02
important when you read the word of God to come humbly and to understand you
3:08
have to get this out of you that God is is judging your relationship with him you have to get this out of out of you
3:14
get it out get that Doctrine out that God is monitoring you and judging your Bible reading time
3:21
you need to get that out of you get it out get that Doctrine out that's the meaning of empty yourself out empty
3:27
yourself out of junk that God's revealed to you is not of him it maybe had been
3:32
taught to you in the church by other people you once respected maybe but now God has opened your eyes like right now
3:39
God is opening your eyes get it out don't let it stay renew your mind of
3:44
that Revelation you've had of what intimacy with God looks like what relationship looks like
3:50
amen so as you come to the word of God remind yourself of that that I am here
3:57
to spend time with God I am here to hear God's voice I'm not here to be a better
4:03
Christian better Christian performance-wise I'm not here to check off my checklist of things I need to do to be a good
4:09
Christian I'm not here to make God say okay I'm proud of you now because you've done
4:16
that you know or I I approve of you rather we want to please God but I approve of you rather
4:22
that our works is not what makes God have approval of us amen
4:28
so come to the word of God humbly with that heart of Lord I just
4:34
want to hear your voice and allow the Holy Spirit to lead maybe sometimes it was a crazy day something happened and
4:40
you weren't able to spend a full chapter in the word or something and you're tired but you're like I want to hear God
4:47
though and you open up the word come with that Heart Lord I want to hear you and read sometimes it could just be a
4:53
verse but God can speak to you so much through one verse
4:58
so much if you come with that heart amen so as you read the word of God with the
5:06
Holy Spirit and and also by the way you're here receiving equipping you're here receiving anointed teaching so this
5:13
this is helping you read with the proper revelation read what the holy spirit's Revelation
5:19
not the religious revelation for example before you might have read religiously with performance but now
5:25
you've your eyes have been opened up through that through this teaching so now this is helping you actually hear
5:31
the Holy Spirit when you read the word of God Hallelujah
5:37
Hallelujah so now when you read the word of God the word of God is full of stories about
5:44
God stories about how he uh how he loves
5:49
his people and is faithful to his people and so as we read the word of God we we
5:54
learn about who God is his character his consistency his faithfulness is so
6:01
consistent that's what's so powerful about the word of God he never fails and we see all these people in all these
6:07
different circumstances whether they had enemies that threw them in a pit whether they had enemies chasing them down to
6:14
die it didn't matter God's promises still remained God fought their battles for them God defeated their enemies
6:21
every time God defeated their enemies and God came through and God was
6:27
faithful and God was loving God was just God was loving God was merciful god was compassionate that was God every time
6:35
we see that again and again and again so now reading the word of God the more you read the word of God if you're getting
6:41
to know God's heart more you're getting to know his character more once you know the word of once you're
6:47
getting to know the word of God well now you now you can start to hear God in your day-to-day
6:55
like as you're doing errands when you're in the workplace when you're hanging out with friends wherever you can start to
7:01
hear God's voice in life when you're not reading the Bible
7:07
because God can still be God's still speaking amen come I want to pray for him right now
7:19
Hallelujah thank you Jesus
7:27
God wants to heal him right now and he's proud of you for your faith
7:33
and how you just drove here fast
7:38
it's okay it's okay so do you want to renounce anything do you know what renouncing means
7:46
so renounce means so this is a key for deliverance many times things are generational
7:52
um they they come from past Generations demonic spirits demonic curses and they pass down
7:58
so for example if there's any kind of Witchcraft in the the past Generations like in your life or or your parents or
8:05
anywhere in his mother's Generations that that's an open door for the enemy
8:12
to come in and you see it later on in their later generations um so also a key a key of seeing freedom
8:20
is to renounce any kind of open door of the enemy like through witchcraft but also like in your personal life and also
8:26
if you know his mom's personal life like any way of sin anything of like words of
8:32
death spoken of your life like I want to give up or I don't want to live stuff like that words of death
8:38
that's an open door as well so you can you can just speak all those things and also so all the open doors that the
8:46
enemy could have come in through through sin through Witchcraft and past generations and also everything that's
8:51
not of God in his life in your life so I renounce autism I renounce him not uh
8:58
listening or behaving or obeying I I renounce him not thinking clearly all
9:03
those things you you can speak that now and we have another microphone right or
9:09
did I renounce
9:14
all the sin and the open doors that I opened for the for the enemy I renounce
9:20
him not listening or announce drugs I renounced um not living right I renounce
9:28
um Witchcraft and my family's generational curses I renounce
9:35
his mom his family did witchcraft I renounced that in Jesus name
9:42
um our announced gangs every now and say
9:50
I pronounce it just not living right and do you know any more details about
9:56
the Witchcraft that was done on the mom's side but you told me her grandma used to do witchcraft
10:02
um I don't know how extensive it was or what she did but she told me that her grandma used to do witchcraft
10:09
okay Hallelujah God is bringing Freedom now to this family into him
10:15
thank you Jesus I break every generational curse off this family now I
10:21
Break Every curse of Witchcraft that was sent Upon This Boy's Life I cancel every sacrifice that was made upon his life
10:27
that he would suffer that he would suffer in his mind and I'd attach you now from all you have renounced in Jesus
10:35
name and on three every Spirit attached every Spirit bringing mental harm every
10:40
Spirit bringing autism every Spirit of Witchcraft must go in Jesus name
10:46
one two three out to now
10:56
thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah I declare healing over his
11:04
mind now I declare a clear mind a sound mind in Jesus name and I declare no more
11:11
disruption of his mind but him to have peace now and think clearly in Jesus
11:18
name thank you God thank you Jesus I speak this anointing
11:24
to fill you both now in Jesus name and God Is Lifting lifting off the pain
11:30
that you've been feeling the the just the pain of the burdens in life
11:36
the burdens that come with the the Demonic oppression he's lifting that off you now because God's saying that he
11:43
knows that you've been so heavy and he's heard you cry out to him and he's answering you now and things will
11:50
be different now you will have peace now thank you Jesus
11:57
you will have peace now yes he's heard you and he loves you so
12:03
much you keep seeking him and you will see complete Abundant Life in every area
12:10
come to you because this is how much God loves you that he wants you to have Abundant Life peace and joy in every
12:18
area Hallelujah
12:23
Hallelujah praise God praise God
12:30
Hallelujah anything God can do and he's doing it now
12:36
Hallelujah and so I was just in Beaumont Texas and it was
12:43
two-day Revival on the first day the same thing happened it was in the beginning of the it was this in the
12:49
middle of the message a woman came there with her son and the son was being disruptive I said I'd stop the message
12:55
just come here I want to pray for you now I prayed for them he was peaceful then and then the next day she comes
13:02
back and she testifies that he's completely different he's peaceful now she was testifying with tears
13:09
Hallelujah God is doing the impossible
13:14
hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus thank you
13:20
Jesus so hearing God's voice
13:26
when you know the word of God you start to be more and more confident of who God
13:32
is who God is he's loving he's full of Mercy he's full of compassion the Bible
13:39
says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
13:44
and when I read my Bible I I look at Jesus I read about Jesus I read about
13:51
how he treated people and I would see other people judge people like the adulterer
13:57
this woman doing many sins and they were saying we want to Stone her
14:03
but Jesus says if any of you have sinned if you have none of you have sinned you
14:08
can cast the first stone none of them could throw the stone and the way he just treats this woman after that
14:15
it's just with such love and compassion and we just keep seeing this throughout
14:20
the word of God how Jesus treats people it's not just that woman it's every person who is a sinner every person he
14:27
treats with just this is Jesus he's like he comes with love he comes and he's like
14:32
I want to deliver you I want to heal you I want you to know that I love you he
14:39
heals them he delivers them he shows them his love and then when he says go
14:45
and sin no more like that woman who who had committed adultery he said it after he after she encountered his great love
14:51
he then said to her go and sin no more so he's basically saying follow me
14:59
that's not the right way to go I want you to have Abundant Life so follow me
15:06
you're delivered now so that so for example Demons of addiction uh are no
15:11
longer there to stop you from from sinning no more now you're free to go sin no more
15:17
you see many the church many people in the church are saying stop sinning stop
15:23
sinning because they're reading reading the Bible wrong the reading the reading when it says
15:28
when Jesus says go into no more for example they're reading it like going sin no more
15:35
goings and no more you know with condemnation but when I read my Bible when I read it
15:41
with the Holy Spirit I find Jesus never condemning when he speaks he's not speaking with
15:48
condemnation he's revealing his love and then he's giving he's then instructing people
15:53
follow me but he's not hiding and not revealing himself and keeping people in bondage
15:59
and saying come follow me and that's what the church does by and large I mean that's what we've seen in the
16:05
church for so long we've seen people not demonstrating the power of God where God's love Israel do you see how God's
16:11
love is revealed to that gentleman there do you see how through a prophetic word
16:16
he knew that God was with him and heard his prayers you see he could no God loves me
16:25
and so from today he's gonna live differently because he's he's actually had an encounter with God's love
16:33
this is how it's supposed to be not that we would preach judgmental condemning messages and saying you need
16:40
to stop sin with and withholding God's love to people when we show God's love to people then
16:46
people will want to follow Jesus the kindness of God leads us to repentance that's my testimony I was
16:53
lukewarm until I had an encounter with this power where I was moved to tears God loves me he's with me I had
17:00
Revelation and from that day I surrendered and I never looked back
17:05
the kindness of God leads to leads to repentance condemnation does not lead to
17:10
repentance preaching Jesus in a condemning way and
17:16
not showing his love not revealing his love through his power does not lead to repentance but it leads
17:22
to lukewarm Christians that's what happened to me for many years I've heard the same message I raised my
17:29
hand again and again but I remain lukewarm until I encounter God's love until anointed ministers who carried
17:34
God's power could show God's love to me could demonstrate the power and I had an encounter with God's love then I the
17:41
kindness of God his love revelation of his love and kindness led me to
17:46
repentance but I didn't come to you with wise and persuasive words I didn't come to you with tons of knowledge but I came to you
17:55
with a demonstration of the power of God so that your faith could rest on
18:00
God's power not on man's words you need to receive your teaching you're
18:07
equipping from from ministers from teachers who carried God's power so that
18:12
your faith can rest on God's power and not man's words for it which is many times wrong and condemning
18:18
makes you think of God not who he is and so many people live these condemning
18:24
lives like like they hear voices in their head all the time and they think it's God they think it's God but it's
18:30
full of condemnation it's full of you're not you're not reading the Bible enough you're not praying enough you're not doing this
18:36
enough you're not doing this enough oh you should be ashamed of yourself you did this they hear these voices in their
18:42
head and they think it's God but the Bible says there is no
18:49
condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and God wants you to repent he
18:54
wants you to repent from sinning he want he but he comes with conviction not
19:00
condemnation and the conviction comes with kindness
19:06
not condemnation you're gonna go to hell if you do that
19:13
you really shouldn't do that I'm mad at you
19:18
that's not how it comes it comes with God showing his love to you
19:23
valation of oh so now you you serve him you want to please him because he's so good you you
19:30
love him with your heart not your mind you love him from your heart you want to
19:37
please him simple and God knows that God knows that's the only way you will change that's the only
19:42
way you will turn from sinning is if you know his love
19:50
it doesn't work the Pharisee way you end up Killing Jesus killing the work of God
19:56
you can't do it the performance way it never won't work you have to know God's love
20:02
to live rightly amen
20:08
Hallelujah so I'm now speaking of how to hear God's Voice through your day-to-day through
20:14
your day-to-day many people and I know many of you I used to be there too would hear so many condemning voices in the
20:21
head you need to know right now that's not Jesus the shame the judge the judging the
20:26
condemnation that's not Jesus he convicts with love kindness and gentleness
20:33
it's more like when you know you shouldn't do something this is God's voice my son my daughter
20:40
that way leads to destruction that way opens up doors for demons
20:47
that way is a road to depression anxiety Suicidal Thoughts
20:52
witchcraft entering the life I don't want that for you I love you my child go this way because this way is
21:01
the path to True Life this way the doors will be shut to Demons so they can't come in they won't
21:06
be a foothold for the demons this way is the path to Abundant Life my son my daughter I love you so much
21:14
and I want Abundant Life for you and I also want your purpose to be filled I
21:19
want to use you for my glory and it's only this way my son my daughter
21:25
that's God's voice that's God's voice amen
21:31
that's his voice but many of you have never heard this before so you've never heard you it's
21:37
it's it's so quiet God's voice that the devil's voice is so much louder
21:42
but you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free this is the truth
21:48
so today it's time to say no to the condemning voices amen
21:55
um so when you're going about your day-to-day now that you know that God is you know his character from reading his
22:01
word from coming to church and hearing the word of God faith says in the Bible faith comes from hearing and hearing the
22:08
word of God faith and the knowledge of God's love and his character and his
22:14
ways also comes from hearing and hearing the word of God Amen there's a quipping
22:21
happening here to help you hear God's voice so when you're in your day-to-day
22:27
sometimes God might be leading you to be a vessel of him
22:34
to love on somebody to give to somebody to be generous
22:42
he might lead you to do something like this to speak kind words to somebody
22:47
in your day-to-day you might get this feeling this urge
22:52
to compliment somebody to tell someone how much they mean to you to tell someone how you've noticed them
22:59
to tell someone something beautiful about them you might just get this urge
23:05
so how do we know if this is God's voice or not well we know that God is a God who wants to encourage and edify and
23:12
love and we're called as a body of Christ to edify and love each other to build each other up
23:19
and we know that in this world people need that we know that we're all in a spiritual war
23:25
so when you sometimes you might feel to do that and before today you might have just thought that was just your own self
23:31
your own self just like having a feeling and opinion about something but
23:37
it's God's heart to love people it's God's heart to encourage people and
23:43
build people up it's God's heart to distinguish the lies of the devil
23:49
so we need to walk with this revelation of when I get this feeling this urge
23:55
that I should love on somebody speak this kind word to somebody that's God
24:00
speaking to you that's God directing you I know it seems
24:06
like a very still small voice but the Bible says that's how he speaks to his people sometimes not in a wind or a big
24:12
earthquake but in the still small voice amen
24:18
so you need to know that the holy spirit is inside of you
24:24
he's in you right now when you receive Jesus as Lord
24:30
and savior of your life he comes and lives inside of you he's not dormant
24:36
he's living he's moving he's breathing he's speaking to you and you
24:42
Hallelujah and I'm telling you it is still and small you have to open your spiritual ear you have to
24:50
listen open up your listening ears and you will find God leading you to do
24:58
that you will find God leading you to be generous to somebody
25:03
sometimes a person might be in lack and God uses you to be
25:09
a vessel to bring abundance into them in that moment to show them that God cares God loves them God is taking care of
25:15
them listen to that voice and be generous to that person
25:21
amen Hallelujah also in your day-to-day
25:28
God is leading you and and directing you in in ways you should go throughout your day to day maybe
25:33
you for example somebody invites you to do something
25:39
but you don't really know this person and they don't seem they seem maybe kind of of the world but maybe they're inviting you to do
25:45
something sounds kind of fun maybe it's not even something super worldly maybe it's just go to some concert or
25:52
something like that some activity maybe you just meet them somewhere but then there might be this feeling you
25:59
get to not go so for example and this is with wisdom
26:05
too you start to use wisdom not just relying on the the feelings because the
26:11
feelings aren't always God we have to discern which feelings come from God Amen this is where we partner the the
26:18
inklings of the Holy Spirit which many come as a still Small Voice and also wisdom
26:23
wisdom wisdom of what opens doors to Devils amen as we've been learning here what
26:29
opens up doors to the enemy and so we know that the enemies coming tricky sneaky ways and so we should be
26:37
aware of that and so for example if someone's inviting you to go somewhere do something you don't really know this
26:43
person you use this kind of wisdom that you've learned you've used this wisdom that God has taught you
26:48
I don't really know this person this person by the way they're speaking doesn't really seem like they they know
26:55
God love God I don't I I don't know if this is very wise for me to put myself
27:00
in kind of control of this person you know get in their car let's say and go somewhere
27:06
you see what I'm saying so you can start to walk with the Holy Spirit as you know his character know
27:13
his voice and walk with this wisdom that God's God's taught you you start to flow in this way throughout your life
27:19
it's very important though that you that you apply that wisdom that you've learned that you don't just go with the
27:25
feelings because the enemy can come in a feeling too the enemy can come through coincidence too
27:32
um a big way that God when I was first learning how to hear God speak was through coincidence coincidence that
27:38
wasn't coincidence but God and this is many times God oh so many times so many times
27:44
I read this book and it opened up my eyes wow all these times all these coincidences they were actually God
27:51
now this was many years ago and this is before I learned about wisdom
27:58
by wisdom I mean learning these practical things these practical
28:03
spiritual things like this could open up a door to the devil you don't know this person don't get in a car with this
28:09
person like just because there are coincidences it's Don't Close Your Eyes
28:14
to wisdom does that make sense because sometimes these signs happen and
28:22
we want the thing to happen and so we we just close our eyes to wisdom
28:28
and we just go yes this must be God and that happened to me one time
28:34
and I I would just see God work through coincidences so often and one time you
28:40
see the devil sees that the devil sees that he saw that I was seeing God through coincidences so often
28:48
so one time he sent this this person to come in my life and it was all these
28:53
coincidences that were happening and long story short it was totally the devil trying to come and get access in
29:01
my life and put me in a dangerous situation and I learned so much from that day
29:07
that we have to pair that the the the inklings the the the the the
29:13
feelings that are many times God that still Small Voice we we have to pair that with also wisdom
29:21
amen and part of wisdom
29:27
is having Godly counsel in our lives
29:32
because I just shared with you ways we hear God we hear him through the word and we hear
29:39
the holy spirit because he lives inside of us and now that we know the word now we can recognize his voice by the way
29:45
when we when we hear a voice that says to uh there's this is an example if we have an
29:51
enemy and they're saying really mean things against us you'll probably hear a couple voices if you're not a Believer a
29:58
mature believer you only hear one voice swear words and in your head and
30:05
you want to say bad words to that person and you want to publicly say bad things about that person and you want to gossip
30:11
and tell everybody bad things about that person that's the only voice you'll probably hear and you'll probably just follow that voice
30:17
but if you are a mature believer who knows the word of God the word of God says this love your enemies
30:24
bless those who persecute you pray for those pray for your enemies bless them love them
30:30
you see how where do the knowing the word of God helps you to know God's voice in these situations so now you
30:35
have an enemy coming against you you have an enemy you have someone persecuting you doing mean things to you
30:41
if you don't know the word of God you're not going to be able to hear God's voice in this situation but when you know the word of God
30:48
now you'll hear maybe you hear a couple voices depending on your maturity level in Christ
30:54
you can hear one voice that says same mean things and do mean things back to them and gossip about them and say all
31:01
the bad things they've done to you and defend yourself and all this you'll hear that voice
31:06
but then you'll hear another voice that says bless them do not speak a single bad
31:14
word about them you rest be quiet stand still while God
31:20
fights your battles for you God is on your side and he will defend
31:25
you you don't need to worry about this you definitely don't need to speak bad things against this person
31:30
just bless them pray for them love them
31:36
there's two different voices one the first one I shared with you is from the Devil
31:43
the other was from God so in circumstances and lives many times
31:48
you'll hear a couple of those voices but the more you know God's word his
31:53
heart you're being equipped like here the more the stronger the God's voice
31:59
will be and the quicker you will be to know what is his voice
32:05
amen so this is how we hear God's voice the word of God the Holy Spirit speaking to
32:12
us leading us through our days and thirdly
32:18
we hear God's Voice through other people
32:28
through other people first of all I want you to know that you are a voice of God for other people because you have
32:35
Holy Spirit in you if you will be obedient to him and I and I shared I taught last week
32:42
about prophetic anointing there's prophetic anointing flowing here you're all prophetic people
32:48
so there there's a spiritual gift in you prophetic
32:54
so as you are are speaking to people as you were when you love on people
33:01
prophetic words are coming out of you and many times you don't know it for example when someone is feeling
33:07
really unseen and they don't feel beautiful and they feel like not smart
33:15
enough you just feel in your heart and maybe you've just seen it you've just noticed
33:21
this about them and you just say to them you shine so bright
33:27
you are needed you're a blessing to me there's times where I really needed you
33:32
I needed the words you said there's times in my life you just you bless me
33:37
you're such a star you shine so bright I see God just shining through you
33:42
you radiate God you're you're beautiful I see God's Beauty through you
33:48
now these are simple words you're not giving them their zip code
33:54
and their bank account number you know they're simple words like you're not seeing those things in the spiritual realm but they're prophetic nonetheless
34:03
and as you speak those words they can be as simple as I as you are beautiful in God's eyes
34:12
you are beautiful inside and out that's God speaking through you people need to hear that and you're a
34:18
vessel of God and God uses people like that God's using you like that every day and you don't even realize that many of you
34:25
God is using you many times people aren't telling you I needed to hear that word many people this this there's some of
34:32
you here where you've said something to somebody and it kept them from committing suicide I see this in the spiritual Realm
34:41
they just didn't feel like anybody saw them they just didn't feel like no one would notice if they weren't here
34:47
anymore they felt not loved at all but you just on that specific day just showed them so much love
34:53
and kicked out the level the LIE of the devil every time you love someone you are kind
35:02
to them you are generous every time you are a servant to people for God
35:08
you are literally being a vessel of God and God is speaking through you
35:14
every time you encourage somebody God is speaking through you isn't that exciting
35:24
Hallelujah the biggest way that God speaks is
35:32
actually through people the most overlooked way that God speaks
35:38
is through people because we are not seen spiritually
35:44
we don't know how to see spiritually many times we think seen spiritually is all of a
35:51
sudden our spiritual eyes just open and we start seeing angels and demons everywhere
35:56
a portal to heaven now I see spiritually
36:01
that's not seen spiritually I mean it can be but that's something that really what's seen spiritually is
36:09
seeing how God sees God uses people to speak
36:16
this is how he spoke the most throughout the Bible through Old Testament through New Testament
36:22
did you know that the New Testament and the Old Testament who wrote it
36:31
it's not a trick question people
36:37
God spoke through people
36:43
did you know that the Bible didn't fall from Heaven one day and it was just there God could have
36:49
done that do you know God is able to do that he's perfectly capable of doing that that would be pretty Epic
36:55
but he didn't do that he chose to speak through people to
37:01
write his word but the word of God is the word of God
37:06
we don't say it's a word of people people's words correct
37:12
God used people to speak 100 his word 100 his work that's why we say it's
37:19
completely the word of God they were able to be pure enough vessels for him to speak through them a hundred percent
37:25
clear amen
37:31
many times we forget this and also something we need to know is
37:36
that these people let's take Paul let's take
37:42
Peter these people many times they've been a spiritually
37:48
abused in the wrong way like worshiped and idolized all of the people in the world all of
37:54
the the prophets and the apostles and the word of God many times that people call them saints and they put huge
38:00
pictures bigger than Jesus and they they even pray to them
38:05
but we're only supposed to pray to God actually if we pray to anybody else but
38:10
God we're opening up a door because God is the only healer he's only healer God
38:16
he uses vessels but God himself is the only healer we're just vessels of the Healer like
38:22
we're vessels of the Healer we're vessels of the deliverer amen
38:28
so that all the glory should always go to God Paul should not take any of the glory but when we worship Paul we're
38:34
giving him glory we're reserving some of the glory for him and not giving it all to God
38:40
so there's people like that will pray like in the Catholic religion they'll pray to these these Saints they pray to
38:47
people as if okay I'm gonna pray for this and I will this is who I should pray for for this thing but God is the only one who
38:55
can bring healing who can bring protection who can bring abundance who can bring abundance in every area only
39:03
him so that's why we should only be praying to him amen
39:08
so there's been this wrong perception of the Bible of the people in the Bible
39:14
being so separate from from you and me today as vessels of God
39:19
there's been this idolization and in the same regard there's a lot of people that think that Miracles don't happen anymore
39:25
but they ended like in the what was written in the Bible that's having to do with people
39:30
idolizing these people these men and women of God in the Bible
39:37
but Paul and Peter I believe they're in heaven right now
39:42
saying I do not want you to idolize me and think that
39:48
you can never do what I did but I want to I want you to be inspired
39:54
by me Peter and Paul we are supposed to be inspired by we are not supposed to
40:00
idolize them but be inspired by them amen
40:06
I mean Jesus says you will do the things I did in Greater he wasn't speaking that just to the apostles he was speaking
40:11
that to you and me these signs shall follow those who believe they will heal the sick they
40:18
will cast out demons not just the first generation Church us here today in 2022
40:23
we shall raise the dead and heal the sick and cast out demons too
40:29
people shall be healed and delivered in our shadow too amen
40:36
we're we go from glory to glory that's God's way Elijah release the anointing to an Elijah to Elisha and Elisha walked
40:43
in a double portion of anointing he did way more miracles
40:49
than Elijah did this is the way of the Kingdom that as vessels we would go glory to
40:56
glory okay that being said we have not
41:02
understood how God uses people today still to speak his word
41:10
we idolize the people in the Bible and we don't realize that God actually
41:16
wants to move through people the same way he moved through the people in the New Testament
41:22
the same ways through Paul and Peter he wants to use us today so Paul was
41:28
speaking Apostle Paul was speaking true words of God Amen that's most of our new testament
41:33
God was speaking directly through him the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was God word was with God and the Word was God it says in John 1
41:40
1. so are God's words is what it's saying
41:46
they're exactly God's words so many times we are saying God speak to
41:53
me God speak to me and we think that that's going to be an audible voice we're looking for an audible voice
41:58
we're looking for a big vision many times we're looking for a big dream we're looking for Jesus to appear to us
42:06
in the flesh that's what we're looking for we're looking for a big experience that
42:11
we call a big Supernatural experience but I'm telling you that God speaking
42:17
through a vessel whom he's chosen is just as Supernatural as Jesus appearing
42:22
in the flesh it's God choosing to speak how he wants
42:27
to speak amen and so many so many of us have been
42:34
missing have been missing God's voice because we don't know how to hear his voice
42:42
we hear this is a big way that God is speaking is through people
42:48
number one he's speaking through people through every day everyday Believers the
42:53
whole body of Christ he's speaking through them like this
42:58
you are beautiful just the way you love is just beautiful
43:04
you are so kind that's God speaking that to you saying I love that about you
43:11
you are so loving you are beautiful that's God speaking when they say that to you when they encourage you that's
43:17
God encouraging you you're feeling so down I don't know if I'm good enough I don't know if I'm doing enough and
43:23
someone here says those words that you are doing so much and that thank you
43:30
that's God speaking God just spoke to you you need to learn how to receive it otherwise you're not going to be hearing
43:35
God's voice hardly ever and you're going to be like God doesn't speak to me and God's speaking to you all the time
43:41
you know I um I
43:47
did not want to preach ever I didn't know how I felt like I didn't know how to preach I felt like I wasn't a good preacher
43:54
I began preaching five years ago as of last week we just celebrated our five
44:00
year anniversary at fivefold church last week Hallelujah
44:06
but I was called to be an apostle and I did not want to be an apostle I did not want to be a preacher I felt like I had no clue how to preach but God was
44:12
calling me to do this so I just wanted to obey God so I did so I preached without feeling like I was a
44:18
good preacher and I'm telling you for about three and a half years three and a half to four years I would hear the
44:24
devil's voice in my head saying you're not a good preacher you're not good enough people aren't being blessed I
44:29
would hear that so many times like every single Sunday but you know the Chantal here she almost
44:37
ever probably pretty much every single Sunday through those three and a half years our church was very small almost every single Sunday she would tell me
44:43
your word blessed me and she spoke it from the heart she's like your word blessed me it touched me it was so
44:51
powerful I needed that thank you she would just speak very simply and it was
44:57
from the heart but I knew that was God speaking to me through her
45:02
I knew it was I knew it was because God called me to do what I was doing
45:08
so I knew I was in God's will and I knew God wouldn't make a fool out of me I knew you know I knew that God wouldn't
45:14
like forsake me and not give me words to speak when he told me to speak and that he would give me words to speak you know
45:20
what I mean so I knew that truth but I didn't feel that truth I would hear all the the opposite of that truth but then
45:27
she would speak that and it was this reminder of what God spoke to me in the past
45:33
and I said that's God's voice right now and I chose to hang on to that to say I
45:38
listened to that voice and I silence those other voices
45:45
so did God encourage me for three and a half years and tell me that you're a good preacher you're doing a good job
45:51
yes he did but it came through Chantal
45:57
but it was a hundred percent God it wasn't like 50 her I know it was a hundred percent God
46:02
amen we have to learn see if I didn't learn how to hear God's Voice through people I would not be preaching here
46:09
today I would not be I don't know what I would do if she
46:14
didn't encourage me all those times because the devil's voices were real and Loud every week for about three and a
46:19
half years and the church was getting smaller from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 to 2 over 4 years each year
46:26
and hardly anyone would tell me they were encouraged by the word other times it was Vivian
46:31
and her mother and her father chantal's father but it was most every week Chantal so if
46:39
I didn't have her voice constantly I really I don't I mean that's how God chose to encourage me I'm here because
46:46
of God's encouragement and because he's given me everything I needed but without God's encouragement without
46:52
his voice I wouldn't be here today amen so you have to learn how to hear God's
46:58
voice stop being like it's so quiet no God is just speaking through people more than you realize because you're not
47:04
learning to hear spiritually I'm teaching you how to hear spiritually now
47:10
every time someone's kind love generous compassionate merciful forgiving to you
47:16
that's God's love that's God speaking to you he's speaking to you every day through
47:22
people amen but be wise to make sure you're only
47:27
grabbing what's of him amen don't be grabbing directional words from just anybody that's a bad idea and
47:35
that's a voice of the devil many times so be very wise to take the love the
47:40
edifying the encouragement take those words they could be from strangers that's fine
47:46
but they can't be directional words from just anybody you have to use that discernment and say I thank you Lord I
47:52
receive that amen hallelujah
47:58
so God speaks through everyday Christians when you use wisdom and discernment is this really God speaking
48:04
this love to me and number two God speaks through
48:11
his five-fold prophetic ministers today
48:16
amen it says in Ephesians 4 11 that God that
48:22
Jesus when he ascended to Heaven he poured out his spirit and he released gifts to the church
48:27
Ephesians 4 11 Amplified version it says and his gifts to the church were varied and he himself appointed some as
48:34
Apostles special Messengers special Messengers Representatives
48:41
so Apostles are special Messengers bringing a message from God
48:48
representing God in his kingdom amen this is what the Amplified word of God
48:54
describes as apostles some as Prophets who speak a new message from God to the
49:03
people this is the Amplified version in our new testament
49:09
it's right there that God uses Prophets to speak a new message
49:18
because God speaks Rhema words today logos means Bible written words that's
49:24
our Bible and he also speaks Rhema new present
49:29
tense words of God you look at Moses
49:35
Moses was sent to the Israelites to declare a new word of God
49:42
your time for deliverance is now God has heard your prayers your time for deliverance is now this is how it's
49:48
going to happen follow me God's chosen it to be this way follow me millions of
49:54
us are going to go out United okay that's how it happened amen
50:01
but you see how God chose to speak through a prophet 100 it was God's
50:07
speaking through a prophet God did not choose to give the millions
50:13
of people all the same dream why because the whole body of Christ is not mature
50:20
enough to be able to discern God's voice correctly there are some people who God sends a
50:27
dream and they miss it there's some people who the devil the devil sends them a dream and they
50:33
say God sent me this dream so they didn't all have the same dream because this is why God uses true anointed
50:42
prophets also Apostles special Messengers to speak a true word of God
50:47
for a group of the for the body of Christ or for a group of the body of Christ this is what God's saying because
50:55
we are not all mature enough to be able to discern God's voice correctly
51:01
we have to learn how to hear God's voice we have to grow in this and so if God
51:07
tried to speak to all of us at the same time like without through people like we
51:12
all have the same dream someone say it's from the devil someone say it's from God someone would say ah it's a funny dream
51:17
and then then Moses would say this is what God said you guys all had the dream
51:22
right half the people would not follow him you see what I'm saying
51:28
so this is why God had this is how he God has order in the body of Christ where he's still today speaking I know
51:35
we don't see it a lot but this is what God's restoring the five-fold ministry this is why God gave us the name faithful church God is restoring the
51:42
apostles and the prophets to the fivefold ministry now there won't be so much confusion and
51:47
Division in the body of Christ when we have the faithful Ministry in place God will speak this word it can be a
51:53
correcting word it can be a directional word but we can know this is a true prophet of God this is a true Apostle of
52:00
God speaking right now so this is God's word whether I like it whether I don't
52:06
whether it's uncomfortable or not I know this is God's this is God's word
52:11
because it's spoken through a true prophet of God a true Apostle of God
52:17
you know we say Revival is now and that all came from a prophet it was my spiritual father Prophet Jordan he
52:24
prophesied that God has heard America's prayers and cries for Revival
52:29
that we've been praying for so many generations for so many years and he has answered them and the time for Revival
52:35
is now for America Hallelujah Hallelujah
52:41
and he prophesied he says God sent me all the way from East Africa he sent me just to speak this message just like
52:48
Moses I mean in the meantime we're all praying for Revival some of us are distracted
52:54
some of us are not ready to bring in the Harvest we're just going about our own church lives lukewarm Church lives right
53:01
but then this word came Revival is now it's no long he said it's no longer the time to pray for Revival
53:07
this teaches us if if the whole body of Christ could learn how to hear prophets we wouldn't waste time
53:13
spending tons of money effort and energy doing a stadium-filled prayer for Revival conference but we'd actually be
53:20
being equipped receiving the anointing walking in the anointing and Healing The
53:25
Sick casting out demons and raising the Dead
53:31
seriously we are pioneering this right now it's a new thing that God's doing restoring the faithful Ministry But as
53:37
time goes on the whole body of Christ will be quicker to come along with the move of God
53:43
you know how many people God could use right now to cast up demons heal the sick but they're still praying for
53:49
Revival or they're still trying to do uh Revival in their own way or not God's
53:55
way it's true we have to learn how to hear God's voice
54:03
speaking through true anointed vessels because this is how God speaks and he
54:10
doesn't he doesn't waver in this people Miss God's will for their lives
54:16
because they won't listen to advice through anointed vessels of God
54:27
they want to hear God in their own way God speak to me
54:32
how I like to hear it so I can feel good in my room speak to me but God says I
54:37
already spoke through you spoke to you I spoke to you through that vessel
54:43
I'm speaking one time I want you to Value it and receive and walk in it
54:51
the prophecy for my life was to be an apostle and as I told you I did not want to be an apostle I wanted to be a singer
54:59
I did not want to be a minister I did not want to be an apostle I didn't want to preach I didn't want to pray for people I wanted to see people receive
55:05
God's power more than anything in my life but I had no dream of like praying for people I wanted to be on the
55:10
sidelines and cheer because I'd only seen one person praying for people so it didn't even come in my mind like I'd
55:16
only see one person casting out demons is what I meant so it didn't even come in my mind like I want God to use me
55:22
like that too it didn't even go in my mind so I hear this word from a prophet you're called to be an apostle
55:28
God wants to do many miracles through you you're called to start a church and I don't want to do any of these things
55:34
but I knew it was a true prophet of speaking by the way how do we how do we know when a true Prophet Apostle true
55:40
faithful Minister anointed vessel is speaking we look at the fruits the Bible says you shall know them by their fruits
55:46
you look at the fruits not with Pharisee eyes or you'll never see the fruits you call the fruits the devil
55:53
you'll call the fruits the work of the devil that's what the Pharisees did
55:58
but you come like a child humble without skepticism and criticism
56:06
you come with pure hearts the pure in heart shall see God it says
56:11
so it doesn't matter what you've heard Pharisees speak about Jesus you come and you watch Jesus Minister for the first
56:18
time with a pure heart not with preconceived notions and ideas
56:23
not with skepticism these Pharisees are saying something hmm I wonder if there's something to this let me look for the
56:30
bad you'll never see the fruits when you come like that because the Bible says it says that when
56:38
the demons were cast out by the apostles for the first time the the the apostles came back to Jesus
56:45
and they were like the disciples they were like we cast out demons the demons obeyed us and Jesus then says father I praise you
56:53
for hiding these things these spiritual things from those who
56:58
are prideful and you've only revealed it to those who are teachable childlike pure
57:05
humble you've only revealed it so to see spiritual things to see spiritual fruit
57:13
to see true anointed vessels of God whom God is speaking through you will not be
57:19
able to see them if you have pride you will not be able to see them if you have skepticism the only way you can see the fruit see
57:27
what's really of God is with the pure childlike humble heart and when you come
57:33
with a pure childlike heart God will speak to you very clearly
57:39
he will speak in your spirit this is real fruit this is a person of God
57:44
that's what happened to me with my spiritual father I didn't see him for long but I knew I I came with child
57:50
likeness and I saw the fruit immediately before my eyes as I missed as he ministered he prophesied to me and I knew this is a
57:58
true prophet of God so I received that word and I didn't let
58:04
any naysayers divert me from what God had spoken to me
58:09
I used wisdom remember we have to use wisdom I used wisdom to not go and take
58:16
a tally from all of my friends family acquaintances should I listen to this prophet of God even though none of you
58:22
have your spiritual eyes opened up to know that prophets are still speaking today and you don't even know about the
58:28
power of God in the baptismal Holy Spirit and you know that's not wisdom
58:34
but there's many people not walking in wisdom there's many people who are not walking
58:39
in humility and seeing people as people seeing people as people because they want their own will maybe and not God's
58:46
will instead of seeing people as a voice of God who whom God is speaking through
58:54
we have to have that kind of humility when God has showed us who a true spokesperson of God is a true vessel of
59:02
God we have not had this perception in the church very well we've we've treated and
59:08
part of that's because we haven't had a lot of like real anointing and real anointed faithful ministers it
59:14
hasn't been like tons so we've we've we've seen church for so long it's just this place like a bible
59:19
school like to get our knowledge and uh yeah I don't agree with quite everything that pastor says but uh
59:28
which is okay sometimes you know when it's maybe it's not an anointed Minister but like can you imagine people
59:35
saying that about Paul isn't that Pride sometimes you know like Apostle Paul
59:41
I don't really agree with anything that Apostle Paul says but he's okay he walks in Miracles and I like I re there's some
59:48
cool things he says we gotta humble ourselves more amen
59:53
because when when we get that I don't agree with everything it's probably that you haven't humbled yourself in an area for God to speak to you something you
1:00:00
haven't known in the spiritual realm yet
1:00:06
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:00:11
so man we need to really change our way of thinking and REM and and know now
1:00:17
that God's speaking through people God's speaking through vessels when there are anointed vessels in your life when there
1:00:22
are if you have spiritual mothers spiritual father mentor if you
1:00:28
if you have questions ask them and and don't be too prideful to think I
1:00:34
I got it all I can hear God completely on my own there's certain things God is withholding from you in the secret place
1:00:41
in your prayer time where he actually wants to speak to you through a vessel but he wants you to humble yourself and
1:00:46
ask them advice amen there's so much so much secrets of how
1:00:54
I've got to where I am today where God's been able to pour anointing and use me for his glory so many of these secrets
1:01:02
is is this that I'm sharing with you right now is that humility I mean God is doing a new thing
1:01:08
but the new thing didn't come from just me sitting and Jesus appear to me and tell me all these new things like this
1:01:15
so much of these new Revelations of how to walk in the authority of Christ how
1:01:20
the demons can go from people and not take forever to leave but go fast so much of that Revelation has come from my
1:01:28
spiritual father teaching me God speaking through him
1:01:33
so much that I've learned has been me humbly in myself
1:01:39
and become teachable Lord teach me there's so much I don't know and you can teach me however you
1:01:46
want to teach me I humble myself amen
1:01:53
Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God praise God
1:02:00
thank you Jesus God wants you to hear his voice always and never miss it amen
1:02:07
but we have to open our eyes to really how where he's speaking not limit him
1:02:12
and we need to be humble that's a big thing to hear God's voice you gotta humble yourself you gotta humble yourself you got to
1:02:19
humble yourself to ask questions you got to humble yourself to hear something new through a vessel he's speaking
1:02:25
you gotta humble yourself to when you don't understand something you don't immediately discount it but you humble yourself and you're like
1:02:31
maybe maybe there's something I don't know in the spiritual realm that God wanted to teach me something new through this vessel
1:02:37
that's what happened with Jesus Jesus was speaking eat my blood or drink my
1:02:42
blood eat my body you're gonna need to do this he was speaking about communion of course but he just speaks these strong words
1:02:49
to thousands of his disciples and it says that most of them left him after that because they were offended by what
1:02:55
he spoke they were like this sounds weird
1:03:01
this doesn't sound like God I'm weirded out by this I think maybe I should go leave him
1:03:09
I don't know if I can trust him anymore all those voices prideful voices were going on in their head when instead they
1:03:15
should have humbled themselves and been like I've seen the fruits of Jesus
1:03:21
I've seen the fruits in my life I don't get what he is saying at all it
1:03:26
sounds so strange and weird but he is a true
1:03:32
voice of God who am I
1:03:37
maybe there's some things I need to learn still I think maybe I'll ask him what did you
1:03:44
mean by that I want to understand better you see that difference of humility
1:03:49
and then those disciples could have stayed they could have had their spiritual eyes open they could have learned they could have stayed
1:03:55
with him amen instead of left and one away from their calling
1:04:03
amen Hallelujah so now you shall hear God's voice you
1:04:09
shall hear his voice very well amen Hallelujah
1:04:15
Hallelujah you shall hear his voice more than ever in Jesus name you shall hear
1:04:21
his voice of love you shall hear his perfect voice of Direction you shall hear his beautiful kind voice of
1:04:27
Correction you shall hear his voice of encouragement and mercy in Jesus name
