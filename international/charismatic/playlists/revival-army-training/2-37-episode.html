today i'm going to share about the kingdom of god and what the kingdom of god means
0:05
and how as a body we can operate together and be united to see god's
0:11
kingdom come to the fullest because god can cannot just use one
0:18
person he needs his body when the whole body is doing its part
0:24
and the whole body likes each other and the whole body is united
0:33
and there's not one body part that's judging the other we're saying i like the way that i
0:39
do my thing better than you do your thing no when we all can be united on
0:45
one accord and we can be united in how god wants this body to go forth that's when god can do the absolute most
0:53
the absolute most that's what will make this revival spread across the whole world as when we can get on the same
0:59
page with god's order and his way of moving
1:06
when we can get on the same page of the new thing that god's doing the bible says that a kingdom divided against
1:12
itself cannot stand so we can't be divided against itself
1:17
i'm telling you the more that we are all united the more god will truly move
1:22
he's held back a little bit the demons can play around more they can get away with things when we're not all united
1:30
amen so it says in matthew 16 18
1:39
and says now i say to you that you are peter this is jesus talking to peter and which means rock and upon this rock i
1:46
will build my church and all the powers of hell will not conquer it and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of
1:52
heaven it goes on to say in matthew 16 18 the same verse but passion translation
1:58
listen to this translation how it's put i give you the name peter a stone and this truth of who i am will be the
2:04
bedrock foundation on which i will build my church my legislative assembly
2:13
so the passion translation translated to see my church which is my legislative
2:20
assembly okay the church is a kingdom
2:26
the kingdom of god his church is part of his kingdom
2:33
and when we operate how he wants us to operate when we operate correctly when we do things the right way in that
2:38
kingdom his kingdom can come completely
2:43
nothing holding us back but the thing is now we have to humble humble yourself for this message today
2:50
empty yourself out meaning religious stuff you've learned things you learned in the past that
2:56
maybe some things are true maybe some things are not maybe you don't know your way of doing church your way of praying
3:02
you know all of these things that you've learned about god that you've learned about church that you've learned about how to pray for people and how church
3:08
should go and all that empty it out that means we can we need to empty ourselves out so god can fill
3:14
us with something new the meaning of that is to take all of it put it in your hands before god in the
3:21
spiritual realm and say god take whatever is wrong doctrine whatever is religion
3:28
out and and make room for your truth
3:34
for the new thing you are doing maybe the new thing he's doing was hasn't even been revealed before
3:41
but let's make room for his truth for the new thing that he is doing
3:47
we have a lot of work to do god has a lot of work to do through us in this revival because
3:53
ninety nine point nine nine maybe a hundred percent of us have a little bit of religion in there somewhere
3:58
i mean just it's been wrong doctrine that's been taught in different aspects of the bible
4:04
different things from how you're supposed to pray how you're supposed to do church how you're supposed to lead people to
4:10
christ the exact words you should say all of these things
4:15
we all have a little religion at least some of us it's a lot that we have to get out of us
4:22
and the only way we can get that out of us and we can know what's wrong what's religion and not jesus
4:28
is when we humble ourselves before god and empty ourselves out and say god i
4:34
give you permission confound me if you want you can confound me maybe i've taught
4:40
these things and you can confound me and teach me this this isn't right what you were teaching confound me god
4:45
you're god i'm creation i humble myself that's the only way you can really hear
4:51
god's voice and receive his truth otherwise you can be blindly
4:57
leading people in religion so today we got to empty ourselves you got to empty yourselves out for this
5:02
message today all right go to humble yourself god's doing a new thing
5:07
and we should humble ourselves when we see god moving so mightily when we see his anointing moving so powerfully and
5:14
demons being cast out and and them going quickly you know when we're seeing him do something maybe we haven't seen
5:20
before if we're seeing him do something that we haven't seen him move that way through us we should humble ourselves
5:26
right like okay there may be some things that i need to learn that god wants to teach me
5:32
so i humble myself god amen hallelujah so um
5:39
you know like if you go to church like lukewarm church or you know religious church
5:45
you don't hear a lot of talk about the kingdom of god or you don't hear a lot of revelation of
5:51
what the kingdom of god really means we just kind of say we're christians
5:56
we're believers and we just kind of leave it at that but we don't operate kingdom
6:02
minded but we are in a kingdom of god
6:09
okay let's think about what is a kingdom think about in your mind picture a kingdom how does it look
6:16
kingdoms on this earth come from the kingdom of god it's ideas taken from the kingdom of god
6:23
in a kingdom we have kingdoms we see them in monarchies we see them in different every country has a kingdom in
6:29
america we have democracy but it still is kind of a kingdom with in the fact there's a legislative assembly
6:36
where there are appointed leaders who help to execute the ideals and the
6:44
vision of the country right in this country for example we have
6:52
freedom justice these are our pursuits our ideals our vision amen
6:59
equality right prosperity equal opportunities for everybody
7:05
immigrants everything right that's america's ideals and vision and so in order to see that vision go
7:13
forth executed it doesn't happen any old way it doesn't happen by people just being citizens
7:20
there needs to be a kingdom there needs to be order there needs to be legislative assembly there needs to be leaders in place
7:27
who have the same ideals of that kingdom who can make laws and execute their
7:34
authority to make sure that that vision goes forth
7:39
right think about it laws that are passed it's because of people who are in office who have
7:46
authority and they make sure that this is taken we take action on this to see this the
7:52
result of this amen we also know that if there was not
7:58
the order of this leadership and this place where people have different levels of
8:03
authority there would be chaos there would be war
8:11
it would be a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand like living in america where we
8:17
we live our lives we know if i go past the speed limit there's a
8:22
person in authority who will execute it on me and i'll get a ticket so i'm gonna follow the rules and i'm grateful for
8:30
that person the place of authority so that people can't hurt me that the police can stop those people from
8:35
hurting me it's a good thing i respect that i see this is how it works in america
8:41
okay so i'm gonna live my life according to that and i'm gonna be peaceful this is how it goes
8:47
do you know what i'm saying you understand that like we actually as a country for the most part we're united
8:54
like we're united in the fact okay there's a president there's governors there's mayors there's
9:00
we need these it would be chaos without them so yeah it's a good thing i'm not we're
9:05
not like revolting like let's have no places of authority let's all be the same we're not doing that
9:11
we're united actually in that amen
9:16
so in the kingdom of god there is a vision
9:23
god's vision that we need to execute and make go
9:28
forth his vision that all darkness would be
9:33
destroyed all the works of the devil would be destroyed and that people would come to know jesus
9:42
that people would be able to receive jesus in his fullness
9:47
freedom peace joy complete abundant life in every area
9:55
that's the vision of the kingdom that the kingdom of god that on earth
10:00
this kingdom of heaven would come to earth on earth as as it is in heaven so let it
10:06
be on this earth amen that's the vision of our king jesus who
10:12
is the head of authority over all of us amen in this kingdom
10:19
so to see god's vision go forth
10:25
there has to be a true kingdom where there is order and not
10:30
chaos where there is unity where there are pl offices places of leadership who have
10:39
authority who can execute that authority to see
10:44
god's will be done we learned about authority last week we
10:49
learned about how god gave to adam and eve authority you can have dominion i
10:55
give you dominion over all of this earth so he was electing them adam and eve
11:03
you have dominion on this kingdom and then they lost it jesus returned the
11:08
authority that was the that was the price he paid on the cross he returned the authority to us
11:16
so hallelujah hallelujah so in this kingdom of god on this earth
11:25
every one of us has been given authority going back to kingdoms of this world
11:33
every person has authority in some way in society
11:39
present has authority he has a certain domain where he has authority of that he has a high level he has the highest
11:44
level of authority in this country governors have a vice president governors mayors these
11:51
all have they they all have authority they have different levels of authority
11:56
and it's just this beautiful system that works out that you have this domain you have this level you have this domain
12:02
governor and you have this level you have this domain of authority president this is your level and it just works
12:08
itself out perfectly there's this perfect order there's nothing missing amen
12:15
it doesn't end there though police officers for example they have a different level of authority they have a different kind of domain of authority
12:22
teachers teachers have authority they have they're entrusted to these children who are not their own and they have
12:27
authority over those children right they're the ones in charge in that classroom
12:34
is that right doctors have authority to prescribe things and to treat their patients they have authority
12:41
um parents you have authority over your children if you didn't execute that authority
12:47
over your children the child can go ramp it running around causing disruption to society
12:53
right your authority is important as a parent in this society to make the ideals of
12:59
this country go forth so you understand
13:05
all these different levels of authority how we on this earth operate in authority
13:10
so now in the kingdom of god we all have authority god has given us all authority
13:18
amen but just like on this earth according to god's perfect purpose and
13:24
plan we have different callings we have different domains of authority
13:31
and god is calling us to execute that authority over particularly our domain
13:38
specifically our domain amen
13:43
like for example the mayor does not have authority where
13:49
the president does and the mayor knows that the mayor's busy doing his job he
13:55
needs to do his job and the president needs to do his job but we know it's clear to see in this
14:01
society we know like the mayor cannot have the authority that the president
14:07
does and when the president is just issues a command the mayor doesn't need to reissue that
14:13
command in fact it would be pointless and it would be not unity it would be going against the kingdom
14:20
the understanding of how the kingdom democracy works
14:26
amen so in the kingdom of god
14:31
there are different levels of demonic powers
14:37
there is also the kingdom of darkness now the kingdom of darkness has lots of
14:42
order the kingdom of darkness the demons the
14:48
devil and the demons and witches they understand this principle of the
14:54
spiritual realm and they operate in order
15:00
they cooperate with each other they know how it works
15:07
they know it's a kingdom they want to see the devil's will accomplished and so they cooperate
15:15
that's a big reason why many christians are in bondage
15:21
because we have no clue we're in a kingdom so we're just operating as if we don't know a kingdom of god exists
15:28
but yet the devil's kingdom is in order kingdom divided against itself cannot
15:33
stand so the devil's kingdom can stand that's why jesus says you can't cast out demons by the power of satan because
15:39
satan doesn't want demons to go so he can't be divided against himself
15:45
he wants he wants demons to stay right that's the meaning
15:51
so this is why this message is so important because it's time for the church
15:58
to be played around with the devil we need to wake up and be humble to
16:05
god's way in which he works and be united and be a true kingdom
16:13
because if you have the kingdom of darkness is serious so if you have the kingdom of darkness
16:19
that's serious and the kingdom of god that's not serious the devil wins but if you have the kingdom of darkness
16:25
that's serious and you have the kingdom of god that's serious the kingdom of god wins
16:33
because greater is he who is in you than he that is in the world
16:39
but when you do things god's way not when you do them your own way demons are not powerful only when you're
16:46
doing things out of god's order and will
16:51
hallelujah hallelujah so in the kingdom of darkness there are
16:57
different levels of demonic powers and it speaks about this in
17:02
ephesians in ephesians 6 12 it says we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but we're actually wrestling
17:09
against a kingdom of darkness and in that kingdom of darkness there are principalities
17:15
ephesians 6 12. prince principalities principalities means a prince of a region
17:21
a prince of a domain so there are prince demons
17:26
who are who have authority who have the highest level authority over their domain over the domain in the kingdom of
17:32
darkness then there are powers there are against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of
17:38
wickedness in the heavenly places so each of these it's mentioning different things principalities powers
17:44
rulers spiritual hosts of wickedness these are actually speaking of different
17:50
levels of demonic powers different levels of authority that these demons
17:56
have that's the meaning now the kingdom of darkness just steals
18:02
and twists and contorts and perverts the kingdom of god in the kingdom of god there are
18:08
different levels of anointing and authority
18:15
and this is just according to god's perfect plan and purposes just like we can't have a hundred presidents we need
18:21
one president we need a certain number of mayors we need a certain number of governors right but we need to all operate in our own
18:28
what if we were all governors and there was no teachers on this earth we all are equally important
18:35
amen we are but we need to know our place in the
18:40
kingdom of god and do our part when we try to do the mayor's job and we're a teacher the kids
18:45
are being neglected and we are being divided in the kingdom so the mayor can't even do his job
18:54
effectively amen so it speaks of this about how there's
19:00
different we can see how there's different levels of anointing and authority in acts 19 11 it says god did
19:07
extraordinary miracles through paul now it says the word extraordinary
19:13
in another translation it says unusual so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the
19:19
sick and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them also in acts 5 14 it talks about how
19:26
they knew that peter was going to walk by when they knew he was going to walk by they would carry the sick out to the
19:32
streets and lay them down on cots and mats knowing the incredible power emanating from him would overshadow them
19:38
and heal them great numbers of people swarmed into jerusalem from the nearby villages they brought with them the sick
19:43
and those troubled by demons and everyone was healed
19:49
and you want to know the biggest reason why in the act church we see we see that
19:55
everyone was healed and we do not hear that by and large in the body of christ
20:00
today it's more like a few were healed instead of everyone not even half
20:06
right in the state of today's body of christ but it's changing hallelujah
20:12
we're going we're going back to this now that's what's that's what this revival god is doing
20:18
but you want to know the reason because the people in the acts church were
20:23
serious about god's order how his kingdom operated and they followed god's order
20:31
and his system and his ways they understood how it operated in the
20:38
spiritual realm so apostle paul and apostle peter we can
20:43
see clearly that they were operating in the highest level of anointing
20:48
and authority there's a story in the bible where the
20:54
sons of skiva there were these people who were trying to use the name of jesus they believed in the name of jesus and
20:59
they wanted to see demons go and they could have had good hearts they wanted to see people be set free right but the bible says that
21:06
they were trying to make the demons go and the demons say who are you
21:12
i know paul i know jesus but i don't know you they specifically say i know paul
21:24
principalities cannot obey authority
21:29
if it is not the high level of authority to match in the kingdom of god
21:37
you can try to cast out demons for hours but if you are doing it blindly not knowing how the kingdom of god works
21:43
demons can mess with you it says they said in that scripture that
21:49
they jumped on them and they hurt them this is why it says all of them were
21:55
healed they understood how the kingdom of god operated they knew this we have they had the five-fold ministry the
22:01
bible talks about ephesians 4 11 jesus gave apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the purpose of
22:07
equipping the body for imparting to the body just like how a teacher is above
22:12
the students for their good their job is to teach and to impart they have the authority over the
22:19
students for the students good amen that's how it is in the kingdom of god
22:24
the fifo ministers have the higher level authority so that they can equip so that they can release so that they can teach
22:30
and lead and impart the anointing like elijah to elisha moses to joshua this is
22:36
god's system that there are different levels of anointing and authority and to walk in authority and anointing
22:42
and to have that grow in yourself you need to get under the flow of the anointing you need to recognize where the higher level is so you can receive
22:48
that and grow so god can use you the problem is we want to be all the
22:55
same that's not kingdom minded
23:03
it's just like saying we don't need teachers we don't need president we don't need government we're all the same we're hippies
23:10
you know what i mean like we're all the same but there would be chaos in this world
23:15
if there was an order if there was an authority and every one of those orders and authorities
23:20
are for our good thank god there's a president so i don't have to worry about war
23:26
being being shot in my house or something thank the lord there's a president thank the lord there's a mayor for the
23:32
same reason amen thank the lord i had teachers to teach me in school
23:38
or i wouldn't know anything thank the lord i had my parents to discipline me when they needed to you
23:44
know to correct me to guide me so i can look at their hearts their
23:50
hearts are pure and childlike and i looked at their hearts and i and i naturally had a pure and childlike heart just from their example thank god
23:58
thank god they were in a place of authority over me and they could impart and release to me amen you understand how it works in the world
24:04
this is how it is in the kingdom of god but it's for our good we get all like
24:11
trying to oh you better than me you think you're better than me and all this we get we have to get out of that
24:19
we're a body and it's for god's will to be done
24:25
not for our own ambitions not about how powerful we look it's about god's will we're trying to
24:32
get god's vision accomplished on this earth let's just do our part and cooperate with his order and way
24:38
amen hallelujah so in the acts church it's so simple i mean
24:45
it says all of them were healed why were all of them being healed because they they knew that apostle paul apostle
24:51
peter had the high level of anointing to deal with even the principalities
24:58
so that if they brought people who are demon-possessed whether it's a principality or not they bring them here those principalities have to obey that
25:05
authority they have to that's why it was so simple that's why demons are just fleeing
25:11
apostle paul's not even having to say anything they're just bringing handkerchiefs to his skin and touching people apostle peter's not having to say
25:18
get out in jesus name get out in jesus name three hours later he's not even saying a word
25:23
it's the authority in him the anointing in him the presence the shadow just makes the demons to go
25:30
that's what makes demons to go it is not your physical effort that's why god has me not screaming because he wants to
25:36
show you guys that's not how it makes him go that's why he has me not not doing a lot
25:42
of physical effort it's the authority it's simply the authority
25:48
it's the authority that's why demons tremble out of nowhere like when we do mass deliverance time sometimes it's in
25:53
the middle of a preaching demons will start manifesting it's because they're like oh that authority i have to obey
26:00
and that's it sometimes the word doesn't have to be even said you have submitted them to be in this
26:06
authority just like going into the courtroom you know the judge is there
26:11
there's going to be something issued as you're in the court amen
26:16
hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus
26:22
hallelujah
26:28
so there's something very important that you need to understand we have to get out of our old way of doing church out
26:35
of our old way of praying for people you have to understand that that's what they're that's without your the the ways
26:40
you've been taught to pray for people the ways you've been taught of how to like minister and do church and ministry a lot of that
26:48
a lot of us missing the revelation of the kingdom of god a lot of that's missing the revelation
26:54
of the authority and it's just like oh we just all need to pray we just all need to pray meanwhile
27:01
demons are just sitting there laughing at you
27:07
maybe if the more of us pray the more of us lay hands demons are just laughing at you
27:13
laughing you're wasting hours and actually god wanting to be doing something else demons are laughing that's true
27:21
i'm getting real here so
27:27
okay now god is restoring his kingdom his order okay
27:32
now when we're talking about how church is supposed to be this is the actual today amen
27:37
let's say i'm like an apostle paul like a possibility today let's just say that okay let's say right now we've see we've
27:43
heard principalities say i'm a principality and then go praise god amen
27:48
can't even tremble when there's not that higher level anointing you don't know they just hide there was a principality in one last week that said i've been
27:55
hiding all this time and it was cast out praise god
28:00
amen so let's say that let's say we're this is the actress of today let's do things
28:06
how they did it in the acts church amen so
28:13
we need to have respect for god's anointing and authority we
28:18
have respect for presidents we have respect for governors amen when when your president issues a word
28:24
when a governor issues a word it is done we don't have to try to do our effort
28:32
to make that issue go forth they're the ones with that authority
28:38
amen so when it comes to gathering together as a church we're here as a church like the acts
28:43
church okay it is like there's a god will appoint a fivefold minister to be the leader of
28:49
that church that's how it's supposed to be a true anointed one not self-appointed
28:55
and only only it's true anointed when it's confirmed by a five-fold minister who
29:01
says yes this person is a apostle this person is a prophet this person is a
29:07
pastor that's how you know it's confirmed
29:13
so it's god's order for there to be a leader who is a true fivefold minister
29:18
of the church and when that person's ministering that that person is in the place of
29:26
authority in that place right now it could be like if we're in the courtroom it's like i'm the judge
29:33
amen that's how authority works when we
29:38
gather together it's not time for you to take authority
29:43
it's time for you to be equipped receive impartation of anointing that authority that measure
29:50
of authority and anointing to grow so demons start recognizing you not like the sons of schema that say i don't know who you are
29:56
and so that when you leave this place now you go in your domain of authority
30:04
when you leave this place not in this place but when you leave this place
30:10
for some of you you're a pastor in your church that's your domain of authority
30:15
for some of you you're invited to speak certain places when it's your night to speak or day to speak that is your
30:21
domain those people of authority some of you lead bible
30:27
studies you're the leader of a bible study you have the place of authority over that bible study in the spiritual
30:33
realm for some of you it may be your household if you've been coming here
30:40
if you've been coming here for example and you've been equipped you've been receiving anointing and you've been coming maybe more than
30:45
you're the rest of people in your family you have authority in your household
30:51
so in your house when you see that darkness needs to go you need to know that you have authority
30:57
here this is your domain and you command that darkness to leave
31:05
that's what makes demons go when they see the authority in you and they see that you know the authority
31:11
you have and they see you properly walking in it
31:18
properly executing the authority that's what makes them obey
31:25
just like in this world if if a teacher or a parent lets the kids run all over them
31:31
they will they have to know their authority they have to execute it properly and the kids
31:37
have to see that authority amen it's the same way
31:42
so it could be we all have different levels of authority in the spiritual realm or different domains
31:48
that god is calling us to but we need to understand when it's our time to operate in that authority
31:57
if we're going outside of our domain and going to other domains we become a kingdom that cannot stand a kingdom
32:03
divided
32:08
and we as a body need to trust jesus his power his power is enough
32:15
god is so powerful we don't need to help god we also need to humble ourselves too
32:26
so like for example when i speak
32:33
demons must go when i speak these words these commands
32:39
over the powers of darkness that anointing works hallelujah
32:46
the demons have to obey it it is enough we don't need to help god
32:54
we don't need to all scream at one time out for example
33:01
you know it is enough god's anointing is enough the word that's released it is enough
33:10
hallelujah so
33:15
we've seen all these miracles we should be able to trust god's anointing we should be able to trust that he's enough
33:20
amen
33:25
and here's the other thing this is very important listen up to this part so we see so many beautiful
33:32
moments of deliverance where someone's immediately set free those are so amazing those are so beautiful it's my favorite moments in
33:38
the world hallelujah but you also need to know that that's not the only way that god works
33:47
sometimes deliverance is a process sometimes the deliverance is still
33:52
happening it doesn't happen all at one time
33:57
jesus one time he said to people who had leprosy
34:04
it says that luke 17 11 as jesus continued on towards jerusalem he reached the border between
34:10
galilee and samaria as they entered a village there ten men with leprosy stood at a distance crying out jesus master have mercy on us he looked at them and
34:16
said go show yourselves to the priests and as they went as they went as they
34:22
went they were cleansed of their leprosy
34:29
can you imagine if you saw jesus in person today and like they saw jesus in person
34:36
you'd be like jesus pray for me right
34:42
what if he said go show yourselves to the priest okay jesus
34:54
jesus i don't think it worked whatever you prayed for me the leprosy is still there it looks the same
35:01
jesus you need to pray again jesus you need to lay hands please
35:07
it didn't work look all these times in the bible and you pray for someone immediately they're healed
35:13
look it didn't work you have to pray harder maybe louder definitely touch your head definitely
35:18
touch me and say it a bunch of times maybe
35:28
think about it what if that what what if that was you one of the people with leprosy they came to him he owe me jesus
35:35
all expected all excited their expectation was that they would see the results immediately
35:42
and their faith wasn't right i mean their faith wouldn't have been right if you acted like that their faith was right because they said okay i believe
35:48
and trust the word that god said so i guess that i'm gonna just be healed on my way he said to go okay i know if i know if
35:55
i'm in the presence of the anointed one i know i must be healed i know i must be delivered i know these demons of
36:01
infirmity must obey jesus the anointed one i
36:06
so okay i guess god's doing a new thing with me that's different that i haven't read the bible before okay i'm gonna see it i'm sure myself as a priest i'm gonna
36:12
keep checking not yet i'm gonna keep checking not yet and then the one guy ran back jesus i'm
36:18
healed only one was grateful by the way and ran back and thanked god jesus says where's
36:24
the other one but look at that guys
36:31
we forget about that scripture jesus is the same yesterday today and forever
36:37
so sometimes just because he's god it's not the suddenly
36:42
i'm free moment that we get to witness but we hear a testimony
36:47
in west virginia i ministered there was someone who was a catcher i didn't pray for him one-on-one or anything he volunteered to be a catcher his his
36:54
first time being where the power of god was he didn't even like know what to think
36:59
he wrote me a testimony that night he went to sleep in his dreams i was praying for him and
37:06
i was casting demons out of him and he woke up and the tormenting thoughts he had in his mind for so for
37:13
all of his life were completely gone
37:19
and he said i didn't even know that they could just be gone like that that was even a possibility that god could do that hallelujah
37:25
and then he said he went to visit his mother who did a lot of bad things to him and so he had resentment but he went to see his mother and he just felt peace
37:32
and love for her naturally hallelujah there have been several other
37:38
testimonies i've heard that as people have left in their car they start coughing
37:43
they are delivered in their car because the anointing of jesus works
37:51
we don't need to try to help god we're not used to seeing anointing that's why we're confused with religion
37:56
you know but this is jesus so okay so many times jesus heals people
38:04
as they leave they don't even seem any different they don't feel any difference just like the people leprosy but they
38:09
are healed and delivered that anointing is in them it's like medicine give time for the
38:14
medicine to work rather than to poke at the tumor and the wound again and try different things and
38:20
therapy give the medicine time to do its work
38:29
this is why i'm saying this is so important that we get aligned with this because like for example if i issue
38:34
these words and this anointing is released it's doing its work after church do not continue to
38:40
try to issue these same commands it's like poking at the wound let the
38:46
anointing do its work because court was in session and it's
38:51
finished and now you have your own courts in life and it's time for you to do what i just
38:57
did over your domain and there shouldn't be people that are prodding on the medicine that you put either
39:05
they should submit to that that's how it's supposed to be like if you lead bible studies you should know
39:11
who's the leader that day for example that's a person of authority that god's anointed for that day
39:16
so when they declare that anointing is being released we don't need to add our prayers for that sesh that time of
39:22
meeting because it's authority that makes the demons go
39:28
it's good to edify people and to speak words of life to people and be the body and allah amen but in terms of
39:34
praying for disease for sicknesses and demons to go no it's the authority
39:40
amen hallelujah hallelujah
39:46
so also mark 8 22 it says that jesus they brought a blind
39:51
man to jesus and they begged him to touch the man and heal him jesus took the blind man by his hand and led him
39:56
out of the village then spitting on the man's eyes he laid his hands on him and asked can you see anything now the man
40:03
looked around yes he said i see people but i can't see them very clearly
40:12
wow why wasn't this instant he sees everything
40:17
he couldn't see very clearly he just could see a little bit a layer was removed
40:26
and then he said they look like trees walking around i can't i can't see them very clearly they look like trees walking around then jesus placed his
40:32
hand on the man's eyes again and his eyes were opened his sight was completely restored he could see everything clearly
40:40
so sometimes jesus heals and delivers in layers
40:45
i mean that's what happens here sometimes he just wants to do a certain work he wants to do and he wants you to come back and do more work
40:52
we should not be taking things in our own hands and saying no all demons must leave now we're going to stay here for
40:58
hours until they leave and while demons are laughing and god's upset because you're going out of his order and that's
41:03
not his he wants it to be done in layers his work for that reason because he's god
41:12
amen and this is why we have to be humble
41:18
because we get so eager i'm so excited to cast out demons and pray for people it's so good yes but we have to be humble and walk in
41:24
wisdom and not take things into our own hands
41:30
amen hallelujah so sometimes you can see people manifesting here after service
41:40
god is still doing his work and the anointings leaving just because someone's manifesting it doesn't mean
41:46
that demons aren't coming out many times that's them actually coming out just like it says demons demons shrieked
41:53
they as they shrieked they were leaving their their victims the bible says so the ah
41:58
is them leaving so when you see someone manifest it you have to walk in wisdom i have to walk in
42:05
wisdom i've learned a lot i have a mentor i've learned i've learned how to walk in wisdom
42:10
to not let demons play around with me that's what they want to do that's what you guys have to be aware of those of you that are eager to cast out demons
42:17
demons will play around with you if you're not humble and walk in wisdom and listen to this word that i'm sharing with you
42:22
so for example there was these two beautiful young girls who were delivered a couple weeks ago in maryland it's one
42:27
of the most beautiful miracles i've ever seen jesus do studying for these precious children but okay so these demons
42:34
i was casting them out they left the girls but god still needed to deliver them
42:40
from more just like the god with the blind and the blind that was done in layers
42:46
that's why many times we see that someone's praise god and then you see manifestations more it's god's doing
42:51
more they needed more more layers there's more demons that have to come out so these girls were set
42:57
free so powerfully after renouncing after accessing keys from god we took a moment to access the
43:03
keys the parents renounced and they were set free it was so powerful and the girls stopped manifesting completely
43:09
for a moment and then later on the service they're manifesting more and the demons start speaking more this time the
43:14
demon comes up and says the holy spirit led me here to teach you something
43:21
now thank god i i had to walk in discernment and wisdom to know that the demons were messing with me lying to me
43:28
they were trying to get me to think to listen to them that they're not my teacher holy spirit's my teacher
43:35
my mentor teaches me can help me holy spirit teaches me as i minister that's who i listen to not demons teaching me
43:44
demons lie when this is this is how it works actually if you want to know
43:49
when you know what your authority is and you're not talking to demons too much like letting them speak but you're
43:55
to the point and not and making them go the anointing can make them say truth
44:02
like say this is who i am or this is the thing this is the this is what's holding them um
44:09
they owe me their life that actually means that there's a covenant that needs to be broken when they speak that so when someone knows their authority
44:16
the anointing like forces them to speak the keys and the truth
44:21
but what happens is if you don't really know your authority as much and you're letting the demons play around with you
44:27
and talk too much they'll lie
44:32
that's the truth so those girls i could see through the demons of the girls i could see the
44:39
demons were trying to make me think that like i had to spend hours more trying to cast them out
44:45
the demons were trying to distract everyone and keep other people from being free i had to walk in that
44:50
discernment and so i said the parents with wisdom i said god's continuing to deliver them he's going to deliver them completely by
44:57
the end i've seen many people be delivered at the very end after the demons are mocking and acting like we're not going to leave they're liars
45:05
i've seen that happen many times at the very end they're completely free the mass deliverance time
45:10
that's exactly what happened they they kept the children there they're manifesting a lot through the rest of the service they were delivered
45:16
powerfully at the mass deliverance time the next day the mom reached out to me and says that they are completely free
45:23
hallelujah hallelujah
45:29
so after service when you see like people manifesting
45:35
what you need to do to make sure that we are united in this kingdom authority is you can say
45:41
you can say to the demons you must obey that issue that was commanded that was released
45:47
you can say that apostle captain released that's it don't let demons play around
45:53
with you because god's doing his work he's delivering them
45:59
sometimes it just takes a little bit longer hallelujah you don't need to we see people
46:05
manifesting we're like oh no i have to do something god is working it out
46:12
his anointing works amen and sometimes there are keys sometimes
46:20
that's why sometimes god does one work but that person needs to access keys
46:25
they need to take renouncing more seriously they need to go home and really be serious with god what is it
46:30
the details i need to renounce and make a list that's many times why we see people still manifesting or or not
46:36
delivered completely so you need to walk in wisdom to know okay well maybe the reason they're not
46:42
completely delivered is they need to access more keys instead of being go go go meanwhile the
46:47
demons are like laughing at you because that key needs to unlock their
46:52
deliverance that person needs to go renounce that person needs to throw out their demonic objects or they're not
46:58
going anywhere but instead we're get out get out two hours later thinking we're so noble for
47:04
jesus when god is shaking his head and he's like oh i wish you would humble yourself
47:09
and get in line with my kingdom ways so i can use you so effectively and powerfully because i love your heart to
47:15
free my people and heal my people we have to walk the right way with wisdom and humility
47:20
to be effective for god to entrust you with powerful anointing
47:26
amen hallelujah have you learned something today
47:33
hallelujah man take this word seriously i suggest like re-listening to it because this is
47:39
a very important word that the body of christ needs to hear for us to all be united so that you can actually carry
47:47
anointing and so that like here at fifo church god can do the most because we're all united
47:53
and we can stand and god can flow exactly how he wants to flow and move and do what he wants to do
48:00
amen
