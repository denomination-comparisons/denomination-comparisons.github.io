today I want to share a message with you that is going to I believe change your life forever many of you
0:06
that will be a breakthrough day today for you where the enemy will be exposed
0:14
hallelujah hallelujah and um you know when you become a child
0:20
of God calls you the righteousness of God which means he sees you as not a sinner
0:27
anymore like he washed all of your sins away he washed them all you're pure because he's just the righteousness of
0:33
God the righteousness of God means pure in right standing and he's not seeing
0:38
you as a sinful person as a sinner but he sees you as righteousness as
0:44
righteous he's washed away all the past all the sins
0:49
this is how he sees you he sees you as this pure beloved righteous child of God that's who you
0:57
are you are pure that's your identity that you are pure that you have a pure
1:02
heart amen say I am pure
1:08
I am the righteousness of God this is who I am
1:14
hallelujah hallelujah so it's very important that you don't take this the
1:21
when Jesus says in the scripture he calls us the righteousness of God it's important that you don't take that for
1:26
granted that you don't take that lightly but you you keep that in your heart this is who I am I'm no longer a sinner
1:33
anymore I need God's help every day I make mistakes sometimes but I'm living a
1:38
life surrendered to God where I want his will to be done where I want to please him
1:43
and so they though I may make mistakes sometimes I'm not though I may sin sometimes with the mistakes by accident
1:51
I'm not a sinner that's not who I am I'm the righteousness of God I'm pure
1:57
in heart as long as you live this life of of constant surrender constant obedience
2:04
constant repentance constant constantly being aware of sins of mistakes and
2:10
immediately coming to God saying I'm sorry repenting they're completely forgotten completely
2:17
forgotten and God understands that you don't become exactly His image on day one of you giving your life to to him
2:24
God knows that it's not a surprise to him it's kind of a surprise to us many times we forget it we can get very down
2:31
on ourselves hard on ourselves um thinking that we have to be perfect you're not going to be perfect on day
2:37
one we are the Bible says we are being transformed into the image of God day by
2:42
day we are being not the day you give your life to Jesus you immediately turn into Jesus exactly 100 wouldn't that be
2:49
nice right but no it's a process it's a process so we need to remember remind
2:56
ourselves of that not get down on ourselves when we're not perfect and understand that God knows this too
3:03
and God's not expecting us to be perfect God doesn't want us to think we need to be perfect amen it's important you know
3:10
this because if you don't know this and get this in you and walk in this Revelation so if you're not walking in
3:16
this Revelation is this better if you're not walking in this Revelation the devil can come in this way and it's
3:25
it's not good so what I'm trying to what I'm teaching you today is to make you aware of the
3:31
scheme of the devil to come in this way if maybe you have not walked in this Revelation amen
3:38
so I want to share with you many of you might be down on yourselves thinking you don't have a good heart thinking you
3:43
don't have a pure heart I want to define a pure heart I want to share with you first of all what a pure
3:49
heart is so that you are not trying to get something that can never be had or
3:56
you're getting it trying to get it the wrong way amen so a pure heart this is what makes a
4:03
pure heart is a heart that wants God's will to be done
4:08
we see David had a was a man after God's Own Heart
4:13
he was after meaning he was really looking intently on God's heart and he
4:19
wanted God to be pleased he wanted God's will to be done he wanted to constantly
4:25
please him constantly be in obedience to him constantly being his will not take a
4:30
foot out that kind of heart puts God first over everything else that kind of heart puts
4:37
God first over their own Ambitions and desires is that anybody's heart anybody want God's will to be done
4:43
Hallelujah a lot of hands praise God praise God I know that our own desires
4:50
feelings get in the way sometimes but that's okay this is life we're in the
4:57
process remember but above all if you've made the decision and probably a lot of you who are here you're the people that
5:03
are after the meat not the milk you're the people that aren't the religious people probably so I know I'm speaking to a lot of you but if that's your heart
5:10
if you sincerely want God's will to be done want him to be pleased with you
5:17
and really have put God's first his will his heart above your desires if that's
5:24
what you want that's a pure heart you have a pure heart
5:30
you are a man you are a woman after God's heart that's what that's what a pure heart is where this is the harsh
5:37
intentions when lukewarm that's usually not the case lukewarm it's like 50 50 or your will
5:44
goes over God's will but when you surrender your life to Jesus when your eyes have opened and
5:51
seen that God is worthy of your full surrender that's gonna naturally be your heart
5:57
because you've fallen in love with him and you just want him to be pleased you just want him to be happy amen
6:03
Hallelujah so Psalm 139 23 says search me God and
6:08
know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if there's any offensive way in me and Lead Me in the
6:14
way Everlasting so this heart will also have this kind of this prayer
6:20
where you you want to be naked before God you don't want to live a double life and
6:28
hope that God doesn't see it but you you're you're in this place of I really
6:33
want to be transformed I really want God to get rid of stuff even the stuff that I've enjoyed doing
6:40
and and ways of life and even relationships that I enjoy but God's calling me to to get rid of them
6:47
I want that I want God to take over I want you desire for him to see you naked
6:56
all the time naked in the spirit naked in the soul search Me O Lord I'm not
7:01
trying to hide anything search Me O Lord and you need to know that God is not a god
7:07
of condemnation you don't need to feel ashamed for him to see you naked
7:13
he knew he knows already and once again it's a process we don't need to feel ashamed
7:19
that we're not perfect yet just let God clean you and purify you
7:25
it's beautiful amen okay so many of you probably feel like
7:31
this is you maybe many of you feel like wow she's she's saying I have a pure heart
7:38
but I really don't think I have a pure heart what is she talking about that's not what I've heard in my head so
7:43
many times I haven't heard that of your heart I feel like I have a horrible heart I feel like I have so far to go to
7:50
be able to be used by God I feel like God's disappointed in me all the time maybe you maybe some of you
7:56
feel that way and I'm going to tell you why you feel that way is because this is one of the biggest
8:02
schemes of the devil specifically upon people who have pure hearts people who are like David
8:11
this is the devil's one of his biggest schemes is to strategically send lies in
8:17
the mind coming in your thoughts saying your heart's not good
8:25
you're not pure you have a bad heart you're you have a
8:30
long ways to go you won't be able to be used by God for a long time and you won't ever be able to be have a big call
8:36
and you can look at people walking in the power of God mightily and idolize them put them on a pedestal and think
8:42
wow I'll never be like that my heart's just not that good that's just how I am I've tried just stayed
8:49
this way all the things that I just said right now this is how the Devil Comes these
8:57
are I'm gonna break it to you these are not your thoughts these are not your
9:02
original thoughts not every thought you're having is original thoughts of
9:08
your own not every thought you're having is coming from God but many thoughts you're having is the
9:14
devil speaking lies in your mind and you haven't yet known how to discern
9:21
what's the devil's thoughts what's God's thoughts what's my thoughts
9:27
and so you know in this revival right now God is building his Army and the
9:34
people whom he's calling are like David's there are people in the fields you know
9:41
people that are looked past completely people that would never because they're
9:46
looked past by other people and because of their Humble Hearts they
9:52
would never in a million years think that God would choose them for something big they see themselves as I'm just here in
10:00
the field this is gonna be my life I love the Lord I'm Gonna Worship from here I'm happy
10:05
you know these the people that God is gonna call people who would never strive
10:11
to be this like anointed servant of God As a matter of fact this is whom Jesus calls when when he first chose his
10:18
disciples all of these disciples were not standing in line you know going to Bible study I'm going to be the next uh
10:26
priest in the temple you know none of these guys they were fishermen
10:31
Tax Collectors they weren't normal people not like super spiritual
10:38
and that is who Jesus chose all of them like not a single Pharisee pharaoh
10:44
season one we hear Pharisee we always like ooh Pharisee but in those days they were the godly people they were the only
10:50
people in leadership positions in the Church of that day which would have been like Temple but if you think of like
10:56
Body of Christ today that's who those people were and Jesus didn't choose any of them he
11:01
chose the the people that were were just like David like David
11:08
pure in Hearts didn't have this selfish ambition weren't prideful we're humble
11:14
had a heart after gods that's humicho so in this revival God is
11:19
going to be choosing people that will Shock the World this person here yeah
11:26
the gender will shock people the age will shock people the looks will shock
11:31
people the the lack of Charisma sometimes it maybe will shock people the
11:38
lack of um you know Bible education will shock people the lack of
11:44
um popularity the lack of um uh like
11:49
uh rubbing shoulders with you know in close proximity to leaders and popular leaders or whatever
11:57
all of that all of those factors is gonna shock people whom God uses God is
12:02
going to raise up people like David out of the field and he doesn't need anybody's help hey then God doesn't need
12:08
anybody to open up doors for him God will open up the doors himself for for these people for these chosen
12:15
anointed ones of God for all you people in this revival Army for us amen for this revival Army it'll be God himself
12:23
that opens doors that no man can shut Supernatural doors and and no one can
12:30
deny God is with them God is with him God is with her no one
12:35
can deny it God will prove himself he will show up and show out to the point
12:40
that people cannot deny Hallelujah doesn't matter the word
12:46
spoken against doesn't matter the false accusations God himself will prove Hallelujah so um God is raising up these
12:55
these these these P these hearts that are pure that are like David's and this
13:01
is the big qualification that God is looking for when he's calling the anointed ones is this heart This Heart
13:07
Like David's he's not looking at the resume he's not looking at your charisma he's not looking at your stature your
13:14
looks your height he's not looking at who your spiritual father mother is if they're popular or not or something you
13:20
know he's not looking at who who you're rubbing shoulders with he's not looking at any of that he's
13:26
looking at your heart he's looking for a pure
13:34
heart that is after his and I see many pure hearts here
13:43
yes but many of you don't know that you have a pure heart but this message is very
13:48
important because you need to be confident in your heart you need to be confident in Who You Are
13:55
because if you're not you won't be able to make it you won't be able to do what God's called you to do
14:00
we are called to be humble but confident in Who We Are to not doubt ourselves to constantly
14:06
allow God to search us to constantly humble ourselves but to be confident and men to not listen to The
14:12
Devil's lies do not have false humility because you're listening to the devil's lies
14:19
amen Hallelujah so this is the sneaky way that the Devil
14:25
Comes as I mentioned is to come and speak you're you're jealous you're a jealous
14:31
person you're an envious person you don't have a heart for God's people you're not compassionate you are lazy
14:39
you don't have a big enough heart for God and it's because I don't see you you're
14:45
not reading the Bible enough you're not praying enough it's so hard for you to open up the Bible so hard for you to spend time with God
14:52
because of all these things you don't really love God that much you know these
14:57
are all the ways that the Devil comes in the mind specifically trying to get you
15:03
to believe that it's true that your heart is bad because if he gets you to believe that he knows your heart
15:09
remember this is specifically a strategy for the pure hearts of the devil
15:15
so if he can get you to believe what he's speaking he knows that he will sabotage your destiny to be anointed and
15:23
Destroy his kingdom that's why this is specifically his
15:28
strategy for pure hearts
15:34
so when the Devil Comes speaking against your heart if you're starting to if
15:39
you're starting to you know have thoughts have thoughts of jealousy comes
15:44
in just because you have a thought of jealousy does not mean you're jealous of a person
15:50
did you hear me the devil's actually speaking many times I mean this is how it all starts
15:57
be jealous look at that person you should be jealous of them and then a lot of people think it's their own thoughts
16:03
and so since it's their own thoughts they just claim it they're like this is my identity this is who I am and they
16:09
they they they meditate on it they linger there they focus more there and
16:15
they let that jealousy grow so what became is just a lie of the devil now
16:20
has been accepted and has now really actually become your heart
16:26
it's become one's heart where now they're really looking at certain people they're jealous of and
16:31
like now they're starting to think other things bad things wanting them to fail you know and so and now they're so
16:38
focused on comparison all the time and then that can even lead to
16:43
um bad hateful actions to try to hurt someone's life or their
16:49
business or their Ministry all started with a lie of the devil that
16:54
was not your original thought that was a lie of the devil this is the strategy of the devil
17:01
so um I'm sharing with you this strategy of the devil so now I'm going to teach you what to do
17:09
how to defeat the Devil so that doesn't become you so so this pure heart that you have does not turn into a bad heart
17:15
but you remain pure completely in the heart and you don't let the devil tell you you
17:22
have a bad heart Hallelujah Psalm 1914 says let the words
17:27
of my mouth in the meditation of my heart be
17:33
acceptable in your sight O Lord my rock and my redeemer that the words of my
17:38
mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight so there are three things that you must
17:46
do in order to keep your heart pure and to get rid of these lies of the
17:54
devil from staying here but getting rid of them and number one is to not meditate
18:02
on what the devil is speaking to you but rather reject what he's speaking
18:11
and it says in second Corinthians 2 5 we demolish arguments in every pretension
18:16
that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to
18:22
Christ so this scripture right here really teaches us that all of your
18:27
thoughts are not your original thoughts and all of your thoughts did not come from God
18:33
this scripture teaches us this it says we demolish arguments in every pretension so that's talking about
18:39
things in your mind arguments pretensions in your mind that sets itself up against the
18:45
knowledge of God in other words that's going against God's will it's going against who God says you are
18:51
that's going against your identity in Christ so we demolish them we get rid of them
18:58
we don't let them linger we don't meditate on them and we definitely don't accept them but we demolish them
19:06
and we take captive every thought take captive means like a
19:13
policeman they're on guard out to get the criminals they want to they want to make sure there's everyone's kept safe
19:19
it's a serious business so they're taken captive bringing them to prison
19:24
I'm teaching you what captive means in case you because sometimes we can just read through scripture and not really know what does this mean this means you
19:30
need to take Serious Business over these thoughts that are not yours
19:36
div get them out of there not just get them out of there but be a policeman or woman be so serious oh immediate this
19:44
can't stay I can't let this linger even half a second go now uh
19:50
you can't stay here go to prison and take you captive letting Jesus take you
19:55
get rid of you take every captive thought and make it obedient to Christ
20:02
so this is this is the first step that you need to do is is to live this life
20:08
now aware that all your thoughts are not your own of this strategy of the devil that he's
20:14
going to come in your thoughts sometimes into always be rejecting them and taking them captive and how you take them captive is
20:21
there's the power of life and death in your tongue the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee So This Is Us
20:26
resisting taking obedient these thoughts by speaking there's so much power in your words so
20:33
you can you can say I reject that thought of jealousy towards this person I reject that thought that voice of the
20:40
devil that says that I don't have a good heart I reject that voice of the devil that
20:46
lie of the devil that says I don't love God enough or I'm not a good enough Christian or I don't love people well
20:52
enough I reject that thought right now in Jesus name
20:57
speak it aloud and the next thing you need to do is watch your meditation
21:03
Philippians 4 8. finally brothers and sisters whatever is true whatever is Noble whatever is right whatever is pure
21:09
whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things think meaning
21:18
meditate meaning put your mind there the your meditation is very powerful
21:26
so what happens many times is when these voices of the devil come against your heart you tend to meditate on them
21:34
you tend to let them linger you think about them more you let them sit there and you let them go on and on and on and
21:40
on you carry it and then you end up being like sad later on in the day because you are literally meditating on
21:47
the devil's voice you're meditating on the devil's lie there's such power in your meditation
21:54
because it makes things more Concrete in you it's it's the action it's one of the
21:59
actions it's the first action actually of accepting the devil's lie it's the
22:05
opposite of rejecting is to meditate that's the point you're letting it into your heart
22:11
and make a foundation there and stay there this can be a point of an open door of
22:17
the enemy where then you'll need deliverance from because you've literally let it you've meditated on it
22:23
and you've really let it enter your heart so it's a part of you now right so watch your meditation make sure
22:32
you are this is why the word of God says think about these things God's directing us there's there could
22:39
be a temptation to let your mind go wherever it whatever it wants to go let
22:45
your mind wander but you got to know that the devil's trying to get you to have your mind
22:51
wander he's trying to get you to think about that thought think about it think about it think about it
22:56
be aware of this don't give it the time of day you reject it and you think about it no
23:04
more you immediately start to meditate on things that are good if you need help go
23:10
to I mean there's so many good things we can think about God made all things good thank you Jesus for the sunshine today
23:18
and I live you're placing me in this beautiful city where the weather is so
23:23
beautiful we even get to be in church in your beautiful creation all the time thank you Jesus
23:29
man I just can't believe how good the weather is in L.A thank you Lord I'm just giving you an example right now of
23:35
meditation throughout your day I mean there's so many good things pure things things that
23:41
God created blessings he gave us and just about God and his character himself
23:46
just about his faithfulness you know about his goodness um there's so many things we can think
23:52
about that are good that are um that are noble that are true that are rights that
23:59
are pure that are lovely that are admirable that are excellent that are
24:05
praiseworthy there's a lot we don't have an excuse right just look around it took me half a second oh the sun feels nice
24:11
on me you know I mean just just look around and just take a moment
24:17
in your mind to reflect remember what God's done remember how he's come through for you remember who you used to
24:24
be and who you are now think about your family your friends he's blessed you with there's so much there's so much so
24:31
this is how you meditate you shift so this this negative thought comes you
24:36
reject it and then you immediately go okay good this verse I need to think of something good now praiseworthy pure
24:42
true right now and it won't as soon as you put your intention there things will flood your
24:48
mind you can start praising Jesus if you need help sometimes maybe if the devil is really bombarding your mind
24:54
read the word of God go ahead and immediately read the word of God immediately turn on one of my videos my
25:00
past videos for example the anointing will come and touch you Hallelujah
25:05
um start worshiping him doing these the it's important you do
25:10
these things like really put your your your eyes to Jesus to his power to his
25:16
word in these moments of like a bombarding attack on your heart
25:21
be serious about your meditation be serious like don't know it's no joke you know if you're sensing that bombardment
25:26
be serious I'm putting this video on now I'm opening my Bible now you know be
25:33
serious about it you know and I'm saying this because this is this is spiritual what I'm sharing and many
25:38
times we've grew up as Christian not being spiritual right and doing things so much of the world so we just go where
25:44
our thoughts take us and we don't think that there's any harm in it we don't think there's any harm in it
25:50
it's just we're just thinking there's harm in it so we got to be spiritual and be serious about our meditation
25:57
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable
26:03
in your sight O Lord my God so the thoughts that come are not your thoughts
26:08
but that from the devil and but then it says think of these such things think of these things think of these good pure
26:14
admirable things the thinking action is talking about make the intention to meditate so meditating in thoughts that
26:21
come are two different things you got that yeah the meditation so so
26:27
when God is looking at a pure heart this is one of the things he's looking for because I'm teaching you how to keep
26:34
your pure heart have a pure heart maintain that Pure Heart he's looking at your meditation
26:39
like that's how he's seen is this a pure heart is this a heart after mind that's why this prayer says let the words of my
26:46
mouth the meditation of my heart be pleasing Lord to you it's a song too and
26:54
I love this song because I love the scripture so much that's why it's a prayer because this is very important to
26:59
God let the words of my heart the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight be pleasing
27:07
in your sight Lord because it's a revelation that you are watching my meditation and I want to please you with
27:13
my meditation amen Hallelujah
27:21
it says in Luke 6 45 a good man out of the good um good man out of the good Treasure of his heart
27:27
brings forth that which is good a good man out of the good Treasure of
27:33
his heart brings forth whatever is good
27:38
and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart brings forth that which is
27:43
evil for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks
27:49
this is why your meditation is so important and Powerful
27:56
because your meditation whatever you're meditating on leads to the treasure in your heart good
28:03
or evil what you're meditating on becomes what's becomes this molding of your heart
28:10
purity of the heart and so it literally says that okay so
28:17
whatever you're meditating on good or evil it doesn't just stay there it's gonna
28:22
come out there's gonna be an overflow busting out of you it's going to be good
28:29
or it's going to be evil and now we know the power of our tongue
28:37
as it says life and death are in the power of your tongue
28:46
you can either curse or bless people you can either curse your future your life or prophesy and bless your life
28:57
you can speak one bad word to somebody that can cause a demon to come in that person
29:04
you know I mean so many people so many people are you know being set free of spirits that
29:10
came in through abuse they came in through words of abuse they came in from people speaking you're ugly or you're
29:16
not good enough or you're not smart enough or why can't you just be smarter you know little things like that
29:23
that's the power we're seeing this right your words are so powerful
29:30
right so this is why the meditation is so important because if you're meditating on bad things you're going to
29:36
end up cursing things people you're alive
29:41
so this is something we got to take Serious our meditation amen and so this is the second thing that God
29:48
is looking at when he's looking at the purity of the heart many times we're thinking God is looking at our thoughts
29:54
and we're counting it as the the devil's thoughts and we think that they're our own so that's why we're like oh I have a
30:00
bad heart my heart's not good and God sees I have a bad heart God's not counting the
30:06
devil's lies to you as your heart because that's not you
30:14
so when God is looking searching to and fro for those who will do his will
30:21
who have a heart after his for those when he's looking for the man and woman after his heart this is this is what
30:26
he's looking for because it can be so broad a man after his heart you know a woman it can feel so broad what does that hurt right what
30:33
is the Pure Heart so I'm sharing you how like God measures
30:39
he's looking at your meditation and he's looking at your words
30:46
he's watching what you're speaking he's watching if you're speaking life or
30:53
death and you know once we have Revelation that our words are so powerful that we
31:00
can be literally an agent of the devil to speak to f
31:05
or we can be a vessel of God for his kingdom to go forth and to bless people and heal and deliver
31:11
when we have that revelation we have such a responsibility
31:16
we better be careful and intentional over our words amen and so God's looking at that he
31:22
he knows the Revelation you have so he's not you know looking when you haven't had that Revelation yet I know many of
31:28
us didn't have that right away and we made mistakes but once you have the Revelation time to get serious about
31:34
your words there's no excuse no excuse you know you have the help of
31:39
the Holy Spirit you have the Revelation you can do it you can be a person who's just speaking life
31:45
you can do it so this Pure Heart looks like has this
31:50
revelation of I want to please God I want to be after his heart I want to be pure and so that has the Revelation that
31:57
heart has the Revelation that I need to be so careful over my words
32:03
my words are if they if they are life they're going to touch and bless God if their death they're going to grieve him
32:10
if their life I'm I'm able to be I'm Allowing God to transform me more and more into his image and I'm stepping
32:16
deeper and deeper into my calling if I'm speaking death I'm literally not allowing God to transform me I'm staying
32:22
stagnant could be going backwards um in terms of being transformed in His image and I'm veering off course of his
32:30
will of where he wants to anoint me equip me and raise me
32:38
you know a pure heart that's after God's walks in that Revelation that my words
32:43
matter this much and this is what I care about
32:49
people in the world don't give any care over their words they're putting their cares in worldly
32:55
things but we as children of God need to put so much care in our words
33:02
this is such a big part of what pleases God in such a big part of what makes the
33:08
devil's Kingdom to be destroyed in the kingdom of God to advance in you to be a vessel of God
33:14
it's the words Jesus says if you speak to that mountain and believe in your heart that what you spoke will happen it
33:21
will happen Jesus is saying this is the power of your words
33:27
your words can move mountains there's power in our word so
33:34
we need to have intention over that so much intention and so when you have um these thoughts coming to you about
33:41
your heart these thoughts saying you're jealous you have a bad heart you are um
33:47
you are not you don't love God's people very well you know things like this right
33:54
don't speak these things and to not speak these things you need to make sure you're meditating not on
34:00
these things if you if this is why you met it if you meditate on these things this is why
34:06
when pressure happens you just bust out these words
34:12
right like I'm so stupid oh I'll never make it I'll never be good enough like you know these points of
34:18
pressure that happen in life makes these words that you know you shouldn't say and usually you're strong enough to not
34:24
say them but you say them and it could be about other people too right
34:29
that's what it means about the treasure in your heart out of the abundance so this pressure comes and squeezes it
34:36
out so you're Med this is why your meditation's important amen so
34:42
you first need to make sure you're meditating on the good things not the bad things and but know that as soon as
34:48
you hear that thought come don't speak it don't speak that Devil's thought about yourself don't agree with it and speak
34:54
it because there's such power when you speak it don't speak it be why be be
35:01
more mature in the spiritual Realm be more mature God I know this doesn't please you I'm
35:07
not going to speak it I'm going to be strong and not speak it Hallelujah and speak the truth instead
35:14
I have a good heart I have a pure heart I love God's people even if you don't feel like it it doesn't matter what you
35:21
feel this is the power of your words you don't nobody's gonna feel like the mountain would move
35:27
but they s but Jesus had to speak it right it doesn't matter how you feel
35:33
doesn't matter how real it feels don't speak it and speak God's will instead
35:40
Hallelujah Proverbs 15 28 The Heart Of The Godly
35:46
so the pure heart the heart of The Godly thinks carefully before speaking
35:57
this is what God's looking for when he's calling his people this is these are the requirements that he's
36:03
looking for so meditation
36:10
what you speak your words and thirdly your actions
36:17
so in Acts 13 22 it says after removing Saul he made David their King
36:22
God testified concerning him I have found David Son of Jesse a man
36:28
after my own heart he will do everything I want him to do
36:37
so he God is pretty much defining one of the big parts
36:44
biggest parts of what a man after God's heart or woman looks like
36:51
he will do what I ask of him he will do anything I see this heart
36:56
this heart has put me first this heart is not a people pleaser this heart will
37:02
be bold for me this heart will do hard things this heart will even go through
37:07
suffering and pick up their own their pick up their own cross for me this heart has no reputation this heart
37:13
doesn't care what people think or say about them this heart is after mine and whatever I
37:19
tell them to do they will do it no matter how they feel about it they will do it they will get it done
37:25
obedience I like to say this it's the revelation
37:31
God gave me obedience is God's love language
37:37
obedience is God's love language a man after God's heart he will do it I ask
37:44
him so so many people get trapped and and don't allow God to use them mightily
37:51
when he had planned to do that because they're caught in their feelings when God is looking at the actions he's
37:58
not looking at the feelings he's looking at the actions he says he
38:04
doesn't say David he will always feel like doing what I ask of him did he say that no he said he will do it
38:12
there will be times when obeying God you're just holding back tears
38:17
it's hard it's uncomfortable it's not fun there are times when you're like
38:23
this is the last thing I want to do right now but you do it anyway
38:29
and there is you know you know I'm preaching what or speaking publicly was my biggest
38:34
fear and weakness it really was um about five years ago it was my
38:40
absolute lesson that biggest fear and weakness literally
38:47
and I was this fearless lady my whole life I went skydiving twice I
38:52
didn't even feel butterflies in my stomach I was like whoa I drove across the country by myself from upstate New York took a two and a
38:59
half week road trip I traveled around the world on a cruise ship and I didn't know anybody on a semester it's uh
39:04
abroad it's called semester at Sea you know like I was Fearless but I did have
39:10
one fear and it was public speaking slash preaching I never even thought
39:15
about preaching so it wasn't even a fear but public speaking was a fear I I'll never forget being in college and we I
39:21
we had to do group presentations and there was just four of us and I just have to speak for just a minute maybe
39:27
and I would go like brain dead I would feel so nervous this is real life this is true story
39:36
okay so um but God called me to be a preacher God called me to be an apostle
39:41
God called me to preach a whole lot
39:47
God's funny God's funny his sense of humor but um like this week how many times do I
39:54
preach Sunday Wednesday Thursday twice
39:59
Friday Saturday this is my seventh time preaching
40:06
the snake and um this this this
40:12
um I I've ministered Friday night in Las Vegas and then Saturday morning in Las Vegas and then we took a flight back
40:18
here and I've packed for London no rests and prepared for church today and here
40:26
we are today and we're headed to London after this yay for revivals now London three-day
40:33
event Hallelujah but do you think that sounds like like super fun
40:39
or do you think if you were my shoes you'd be like can I get a break do I have to preach again
40:47
no like I'm telling you like I don't always feel like well first of all preaching was my weakness okay
40:53
meaning I didn't like it or public speaking was my weakness okay I mean I didn't like it it was purely out of
40:59
obedience and I'm telling you that when I first started preaching I would sometimes hear the devil speaking to me
41:05
like like making me feel down that I wasn't excited to preach you know especially because all the preachers
41:11
that I had seen before were like maybe not like this I might be a little
41:16
overwired but like oh my depression and it just looks like they're having so much fun and it just looks like they're
41:23
born to do this and it's just like oh and like when you see that it doesn't look like fake it looks like
41:31
they're born to do that and they love doing they love doing that you know what I mean and I never heard
41:38
anybody testify to me I never heard like a preacher ever ever tell me like yeah I
41:46
never wanted to preach but God asked me to so I did it and it was hard and a lot of times I still don't want to but I just
41:52
do it because I want to obey God I never heard that you know I never heard that so because
41:59
of that the devil would really speak to me in that way so he would speak to me two things he would speak to me you're not a good preacher you're not a good
42:06
preacher people aren't being blessed nobody's staying people are leaving Church's getting smaller see you're not
42:12
a good preacher you're not good enough you don't feel like you're a good preacher that's the truth you know
42:17
there's a reason you feel like you're not a good preacher it's the truth um so I'd hear that but then I'd also
42:23
hear I'd also hear you know or if I should say feel but it was really a devil speaking I would feel like
42:30
I feel like there's something wrong with me that I'm not like so excited to preach but I'm just doing it because God
42:36
called me to do it and you know so
42:41
um I had to overcome that I had to overcome that I had to overcome that and I I know now
42:47
that the feelings are not the truth the feelings are not what God looks at and
42:52
even to this day when I'm so many times when I preach it's so much out of obedience it's so much out of Faith so
42:58
many times I wish I wish every time it was like oh yes oh I got a word oh
43:07
I feel it in my bones
43:15
I wish I wish you that
43:21
machine tomorrow but I but I I never speak that and I say Lord I need you I
43:28
have no idea what to preach I need you to tell me what to preach so much I wish it was like oh I feel it
43:36
I felt I wish
43:42
but it's just this place of weakness and obedience
43:48
I must obey my Lord so I'm going to appreciate I'm gonna preach with joy and I'm going to preach for the fire of God
43:54
it's not about my feelings but I'm going to preach for Joy I'm going to put we're we're Spirit soul body so it's the
44:01
spirit that we that we lead with not the soul we don't let the soul lead
44:07
it's the spirit so um so yeah so God's looking at the actions
44:14
so so many of you have disqualified yourself from doing things for God
44:20
whether it's preaching whether it's worshiping being a worship leader whether it's starting out the business
44:25
he's called you too whatever it is whatever the action it is
44:30
that you have maybe felt God speak you should do this I want you to do this so
44:36
many of you have disqualified yourself because of your feelings because you thought you needed to have this intense
44:43
feeling passion fire about it all the time otherwise you weren't being real or
44:48
authentic or something or you don't have what it takes
44:54
only those who are feeling it and passion and passion they have what it takes
45:01
God's looking at the actions David will do what I ask him
45:07
not David will feel always like doing what I ask of him
45:14
he will do it God calls us to do a lot of hard things there's no way we're ever going to feel
45:19
like doing everything Hallelujah
45:24
Hallelujah so it's the it's the actions it's the actions is the third thing that
45:30
God is looking at to see do you have a do you have a pure heart and I can use you
45:36
your actions um so when these these these uh things
45:41
come to our mind we should not act on them but do the opposite of it is what we should do
45:48
when these voices of the devil come to our mind so we reject them we meditate on God's truth instead
45:54
we don't speak the Devils lie about our heart we speak God's truth instead and
46:00
then we take action not on what the devil spoke we don't take action on that
46:07
but we take action on the opposite the opposite of what the devil's saying
46:12
the opposite of what we're feeling we take action on that and guess what you're probably not going
46:17
to feel like it because remember that devil's voice feels like yourself feels like a Feeling
46:24
but you take action anyway and that's what God sees is true so you see it starts with you feel like
46:31
you have a bad heart you feel a certain way and then everything else follows
46:36
but if we go the opposite way you have this thought from the devil this voice or the devil you you go God's
46:43
way God sees this as true so you you heard this devil's voice saying you have a bad
46:48
heart and you think you have a bad heart that you feel it so strongly but when you do
46:53
these things that I just taught you meditate on what God's asking to meditate on speak what God's asking you to speak on don't speak what the devil's
46:59
saying and do what God's calling to do the opposite of what the devil's speaking about you God says
47:05
that's a pure heart that's a heart after mind and it will shock you you won't even
47:11
believe it that's how I was when I was called by God like when I received that prophecy I was like what
47:18
because it doesn't feel because you don't feel like you know you don't feel
47:23
it because the devil's so hard speaking against your Pure Heart
47:28
um I remember when the prophet prophesied to me you're called to be an apostle I remember um
47:33
hearing that and and before that time I always knew that I was like different like I always knew I had more of a
47:40
passion for God than my peers but I lived a long life of lukewarmness
47:46
I only had surrender to God nine months before the prophet prophesied that over my life
47:52
so I didn't think I was somebody too special and there was this huge prophecy spoken
47:59
over my life that was called the Apostle reach the Nations and shocking Miracles will happen Rivals gonna break out
48:05
and I was very much like who me why aren't there better people that got
48:11
like what I didn't you know but then God started to teach me
48:17
that it's about your meditation your words your actions not your feelings
48:23
that's what I'm looking at those that will refuse to disobey God
48:29
those will those that will refuse to speak a word of death those that will refuse
48:36
to take a step out of God's will serious about it amen
48:42
Hallelujah just like in the real world we don't look at we don't listen to just talk we want to see the actions
48:49
people talk good talk but what's their actions right
48:54
Hallelujah so I want to give you so now just some practical examples of these
49:00
specific thoughts that can come in your mind and what to do um this is a powerful example right here
49:06
I want to share a story with you so um back in like february-ish time
49:12
February I think it was February February or March there were there was like these rumors
49:18
going around about me online and just people talking just
49:24
false accusations and there's something that a lot of people were saying saying there's just something that doesn't sit
49:30
with my sit right with my spirit that was something that's being like thrown around a lot yeah I agree and so then
49:36
there's this um people be like yeah I agree I feel the same thing I'm annoyed when I hear her speak well it's probably
49:42
the Demons Inside they don't like me not probably it is you know
49:49
actually there's a testimony I'm trying to remember or see if I could
49:54
um have someone pull it up I just put on my story yesterday there's a testimony somebody shared I'm gonna try to
50:00
remember it but she was like I used to be annoyed when I listen to you
50:06
something like that I was uncomfortable I didn't like something like that and then and then she's like but then I
50:12
really realized like maybe maybe there's a reason like maybe I should actually listen more like maybe
50:18
there's something in me something like that and she says that God delivered her
50:23
and now she says that she thanks God for me and my Ministry so much as one of her
50:28
biggest blessings she does glory to God glory to God
50:33
Hallelujah okay so back to the story so back in February when there was these
50:39
like rumors going around um there was this one guy named Troy black he has a YouTube channel some of
50:44
you may know him so he's he speaks perfect prophetically and he has a YouTube channel
50:51
um I think with like 300 something subscribers now but I he I didn't know him about him at the
50:56
time but somebody sent me his video and um I watched the video and the video was
51:02
about me and the video was like what God spoke to me about Apostle Catherine Crick and so I'm gonna paraphrase like
51:08
what he shared so he said so I was like I was seeing Apostle
51:14
Catherine's um thumbnails on YouTube the titles and when I would see them
51:21
I would just like I would just feel like uncomfortable and I was just like swipe right past them I wouldn't even read the
51:27
title and he says if someone had came to me at that time
51:33
I would have told them that something doesn't sit right with my spirit he's like a lot of people are
51:38
saying this and I'm like I would probably say that he's like but then as time passed God
51:46
convicted me that I was jealous of her and there was Envy in my heart
51:54
um because I have been on YouTube for 10 years and her Ministry was like blowing
52:00
up growing so much faster she'd been on YouTube for such or online for such a quicker time shorter time
52:06
and um I was jealous that my Ministry wasn't growing as fast and he said God reveal
52:12
that to me and I repented he said
52:18
and um now he says when he sees my thumbnails he prays for me and he gets
52:25
excited about what God is doing through my Ministry Hallelujah
52:30
hallelujah praise God you see how the devil's a liar oh he's a liar
52:37
he's a liar like you see how but you see how tricky he came I was teaching you in the beginning of this message how he
52:43
comes and you you feel something in your heart right and then you start to feel jealous
52:50
but if you're prideful you maybe won't recognize it as jealousy
52:56
right but when this guy had a humble heart this shows that he had a pure heart now
53:03
people that don't know pure hearts could say well he didn't have a pure heart at first no he had a pure heart he went
53:08
through a devil a devil's attack and it took him a moment
53:14
now he'll know to reject quicker probably but it took him a moment and then because he had a humble heart he
53:22
was able because he had he must have had the heart that says search me God and know my heart test me and know my
53:28
anxious thoughts that must have been his intention that's not everybody's intention but that must have been his intention
53:34
that must have been on the Forefront of his heart that must have been his prayer for God to answer his prayer and say
53:40
this is your thought this is your thought this is the heart right now that we need to get rid of this lie of the
53:46
devil right so he was able to hear God answer that prayer of search Me O Lord
53:51
know my heart he was able to hear and say oh that's what this is
53:57
oh this is not my original thought oh this thought did not come from God warning me to stay away from a false
54:04
prophet right this is the devil this is the devil trying to make me
54:11
um think this is my thought and attack but or eventually maybe attack a servant
54:17
of God or miss out on being blessed by that Ministry you know um this is what the devil's doing so I
54:24
reject this I reject this so he just did the actions of what I was teaching today you see he
54:31
he oh he realized he rejected that thought that's not my that's that's the devil
54:37
and then he began to now look at my Ministry instead of skipping past it he's looking at the videos so he's
54:44
meditating on good things right you mentioned on the opposite of what God was or the devil was saying and then he
54:50
took action and he spoke he spoke prayers he took action to pray he took action to
54:58
make this video which is so powerful to help other people who are in the same place who
55:03
didn't know it was the devil speaking to them amen so you see this the scheme of the
55:10
devil Victory he had over it Hallelujah God With the Devil meant for
55:16
harm God turn it around for our good Hallelujah praise God so this is what you should do
55:23
when you and have this have this um awareness let that teach you if you are feeling so like antsy about
55:31
your dreams right oh I want this to grow it's taking so long I want this
55:38
be aware if you're feeling discontentment be aware
55:45
because you know what the next Devil's scheme is it's a point to somebody else
55:50
for you to be jealous of them to try to keep you from moving forward in God's
55:55
purpose but hijack you Veer you off and then do damage upon a blessed uh an
56:01
anointed person of God right so be aware of that if you start to feel discontentment repent say Lord I trust
56:09
your timing and I repent for making an idol of this um I Trust You Lord I'm content speak it
56:15
aloud and and then and be and then also be aware when you start to see someone else that has what you want be aware if
56:23
you start to feel weird feelings that's probably a jealousy thing starting to come not your original thought remember
56:29
from the Devil and so if you start feeling jealousy by the way
56:34
um don't immediately think oh oh I'm a jealous person that's what the devil wants that's what the devil wants
56:41
remember it's the devil bringing these things you don't have to accept them so reject it say I reject every thought of
56:48
jealousy towards this person and then speak blessing over them pray for them
56:54
and begin to praise God and thank God for his perfect timing and for molding
56:59
you and just declare I am content in God's will I am content where I am right
57:04
now amen so that's practically how to overcome that uh lie of the devil of jealousy or
57:12
Envy um now the next one this is another big scheme to try to attack pure hearts that
57:18
the devil would speak that you don't have uh a good heart for God's people you don't have a heart for people you're
57:24
not compassionate enough maybe this can come for maybe you feel maybe you have a feeling of judgment towards somebody how
57:31
they look or how they speak or you feel annoyed by them or something like that you it feels like the opposite of Love
57:36
is what you're feeling inside right remember this is the devil scheme it's not you reject that thought and and say
57:45
God I want to see them with your eyes and begin speaking
57:50
God's heart over them begin speaking God's heart over them pray for them
57:57
and also in step two with the action part is Love on God's people if this is a
58:04
strategic attack of the enemy on your heart saying you don't have compassion you don't have a good heart for God's people even if you don't feel like it
58:10
start being generous serve people help people out buy them lunch do something
58:15
nice for them be thoughtful do something for them be kind speak words of kindness when you don't feel like it maybe you're
58:21
very introverty or whatever but go out of your way be intentional and say you
58:26
have a beautiful smile or something find something kind and loving to say compassionate it doesn't matter if you
58:33
feel like or not this is you rejecting the devil and you're saying I am compassionate I do love God's people I
58:40
have a big heart for God's people Hallelujah and then um thirdly the other another
58:48
major attack of the devil on good hearts on pure hearts is he will speak to you
58:53
that you don't have a big enough heart for God that many times this comes in the form of the spirit of religion
59:00
saying that you're not doing enough Christian activities rituals saying that you're not reading the Bible
59:06
enough not praying enough not taking enough alone time with God um all of this
59:13
it's so important God wants you to not be in a relationship with him out of
59:18
religion going through rituals uh I'm not reading my Bible enough I
59:25
think God's not happy with me I don't have a good heart I better read my Bible more okay okay I feel better
59:33
you know you're where you're going in it to perform right but God wants you to
59:38
get all of that religious junk out he's not looking he's not standing there with a checklist how many chapters of the
59:44
Bible did you read today how many hours did you spend time in prayer with me today he's not it's a relationship we
59:51
don't judge our relationships in real life we don't sit with our friend and say
59:56
yeah I did a good job Loving Her Today because I spent a whole 58 minutes at the coffee shop talking with her you
1:00:03
love your friend you love spending time with them that it's silly isn't it silly when you
1:00:08
think about it like that God is a person he's your best friend he wants you to see him that way take him everywhere
1:00:16
don't just isolate him to only the prayer closet for half an hour hour a day take him everywhere with you be in
1:00:22
relationship with him and and flow with him flow with his Spirit follow his
1:00:28
spirit and so his spirit will lead you read the word of God now read this much sometime it could be just a verse but he
1:00:34
wants you to meditate on that sometimes he might be calling you like look at these busy days I've had sometimes life
1:00:39
is like that busy busy busy but God actually wants you to be busy busy busy to do work for him for certain reasons
1:00:45
right but don't get down on yourself that you're not reading a whole hour of the Bible that day Godzilla needs to
1:00:51
read one scripture and meditate on it throughout the day maybe that day for example amen
1:00:56
Hallelujah so um Please be aware be aware of this religious spirit that likes to condemn
1:01:02
and speak you're not a good enough Christian you don't love God enough because you didn't spend enough time in the Bible today that's the devil I
1:01:10
expose him today beware of him reject him and and just remember God is not
1:01:16
like that man he's not like that he's not like that he's your best friend he's your father he's with you
1:01:22
everywhere so make sure you're seeing him that way don't don't be blinded and go the
1:01:29
religious way all right so reject those thoughts when they come
1:01:34
and and invite Holy Spirit Lord how do you want me to
1:01:39
um spend time with you today for example ask him invite him amen
1:01:46
and um and then of course speak speak the truth I love God I love God so much
1:01:51
I love to spend time with God I love the word of God I love to read the word of God I love to pray I love to talk to God
1:01:58
I love like speak these things if the devil's speaking against you that you you don't have an appetite for the Bible
1:02:03
as much as you have an appetite for this or you know things he can speak to trying to make you feel guilty
1:02:08
speak the truth and then worship God do whatever the devil's
1:02:15
speaking to you do the opposite worship God spend time with God read the word
1:02:21
serve God oh this is a big scheme I expose a religious spirit today
1:02:27
there's some people who are called who God is calling them to to serve God to do the work of God to help the work of
1:02:33
God to serve here faithful Church to edit videos to do things to come to events and serve sir he's calling you to
1:02:40
do this and this is a scheme of the devil I've seen before where a devil will speak your heart's not good you need to stay
1:02:46
at home and read the Bible and it's the devil hijacking somebody from being in God's will serving God with a religious
1:02:54
spirit because the devil's been speaking your heart's not good your heart's not good your heart's not good you should be ashamed you don't you're not worthy to
1:03:00
be serving in the ministry you need to take a time out and um be
1:03:06
punished punish yourself and religiously read the Bible I expose
1:03:12
that scheme of the devil today watch out for that watch out for that I can tell you God
1:03:17
God always wants you to serve him God always wants you to help with the work of God that's what's pleasing him amen
1:03:23
when to be truthful reading the Bible out of the religious spirit is not pleasing him read in the Bible you hear that reading
1:03:29
the Bible out of the religious spirit is not pleasing him amen hallelujah
1:03:36
reading the word in obedience to him rejecting the religious spirit following his spirit is pleasing to him
1:03:43
amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God
1:03:49
so God wants you to rest in your heart to be confident in Who You Are
1:03:54
to to rest God is proud of me he wants you to hear his voice saying that I have a good
1:04:01
heart God can use I am pure he wants you to rest in this
1:04:06
because if you don't devil can hijack you from your from being used powerfully by God to be used
1:04:13
powerfully by God you need to be confident in who you are you need to know your identity in Christ
1:04:20
you need to be spiritual and know the schemes of the devil and never give him
1:04:26
an ear you need to be confident that the father loves you that God loves you and he's proud of you
1:04:33
otherwise you don't have strength and joy to overflow upon others
1:04:39
but you're like this you're serving God like this
1:04:45
I don't feel Worthy to know who we are
1:04:51
rest in God's love amen Hallelujah
1:04:57
praise God say I have a pure heart I am the righteousness of God
1:05:05
I'm confident in who I am I love God
1:05:11
I love his people I'm content in his timing and his will
1:05:18
amen hallelujah
