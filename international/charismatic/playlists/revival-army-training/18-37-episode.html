today you are going to learn how to always
0:06
stay on fire for God
0:11
how to be blazing with passion with Zeal for Jesus every day
0:19
it is possible many of you don't think it's possible because you you don't know what really
0:25
being on fire is like you don't know what it re what that really means
0:31
it says Romans 12 11 never be lacking in Zeal
0:36
but keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord
0:42
and that's the that's the NIV version Amplified version says don't burn out keep yourselves fueled and aflame be
0:50
alert Servants of the master cheerfully expectant
0:57
let me tell you what being on fire is not being on fire is not having the feeling
1:05
of being on fire
1:10
it is not about your feelings at all
1:15
and that's why many of you people think you are not on fire for God but the truth is is that many of you
1:21
here are on fire for God and with this Revelation you're gonna be burning
1:27
Ablaze with God's fire like never before
1:32
you know um when I first surrendered to Jesus when I first encountered God's power
1:38
you know I always I always loved God but I never consider myself to be on fire I I would look at preachers and other
1:45
people and they seem to be on fire and I was like I want that but I don't know how to get that what's wrong with me and
1:51
then um one day I encountered the power of God I was where anointing was
1:57
and his power touched me his power touched my spirit and literally ignited
2:03
me ignited he he I needed him to ignite me I needed his power to ignite me I needed
2:10
his anointing to ignite me and when that happened I was like it happened I always wanted this it's
2:18
really happened and I just want to tell everyone about Jesus I only wanted to talk about Jesus
2:25
I didn't want to see a movie that didn't have to do with Jesus I didn't want to have a conversation that wasn't about Jesus really
2:31
I was on fire and I never wanted to go out and um part of me like never wanting to
2:40
go out was um well first of all
2:45
when I first was set on fire I had the feeling of being on fire like I feel on
2:51
fire right that feeling the emotion I had that and when I was first set on fire I
2:57
thought that being on fire was the emotion and the emotion lasted for a long time
3:03
but I was like I don't want this to leave I don't want this to leave so what am I going to do I started going to
3:09
church events and bible studies like buffet style somebody invited me something to do with God I'm there
3:15
somebody invited me something else having to do with God I'm there which is good like for a season maybe but
3:21
honestly the intention of me doing that buffet buffet here there everywhere different different Bible studies
3:27
different here here the whole purpose of me doing that was I was afraid I was going to to lose my emotion of being on
3:36
fire that was what motivated me to go to these things buffet style
3:42
rather than really seeking what does God want me to do every minute of every day
3:50
I was seeking I want this emotion of being on fire to stay
3:56
and and then God taught me that it is not about your emotions that
4:04
What Makes You On Fire but what makes you to be on fire for God
4:09
to to to be on fire to be zealous it means to be passionate about something
4:17
so to be on fire for God is to be passionate excited
4:23
about him about his kingdom about his work but that's not a feeling being
4:30
passionate in the spiritual way is not about a Feeling but it's about your truth what you
4:37
believe in your faith so when God first ignited me and yes the
4:43
feeling of being on fire was there too this deep conviction truth came to me
4:51
that God is so good and he is worthy of my surrender and I'm gonna give my whole
4:58
life to him I want to give my whole life to him and his plans for me are so good
5:03
it was this deep conviction that he was just so good that his word of God was
5:09
indeed true and it was just this deep conviction God
5:15
is good and he is who he says he is and he is faithful and I can trust him and I
5:21
love him so much it was this deep knowing of those truths
5:30
and see that's what's being on fire is is is is is
5:36
that when those things become your truth that's you you will love God you know he
5:44
is faithful you know he is good being zealous being on fire is staying
5:51
in that truth is staying in that truth every day no
6:00
matter the circumstances no matter when times get hard when it's
6:05
a Wilderness season When Trials hit your truth Remains the Same
6:12
God is good God is faithful I love him I'm surrendered and nothing will ever
6:18
change that and I will serve him every day of my life so there will be some days
6:23
where things are going so amazingly I mean it's like life is so good with all
6:30
the good things happening and this will be you God is good God is faithful you
6:36
feel the your shins he's so good I love God so much
6:43
because I love you and then there will be days it could be in the wilderness season it can be when
6:50
God's putting you through the fire there will be tougher days where you will be in the same exact
6:57
place of Truth but the feelings might not be the same
7:04
it might look more like this God you are so good God you are faithful I love you so much
7:13
I'm surrendered to you and I will serve you all my days when it gets really really hard
7:18
sometimes it can look like this instead of Tears of Joy it's tears of of sadness
7:23
for a moment it's tears of pain and it's God you're so good you're faithful
7:29
I trust you I love you I know your promises will come to pass
7:37
I trust in you I love you
7:43
but it's the same truth it's the same truth
7:51
don't look at the feelings God's not looking at the feelings the Bible says that man looks at the
7:57
outward appearance man looks at the emotions
8:03
but God looks at the heart and um the meaning of that the meaning
8:10
of that God looks at the heart one of the meaning one of the meanings of God looks at the heart is he's looking at
8:17
the maturity of your heart
8:23
the consistency of your heart the Covenant you've made with him
8:29
is that there or on days you feel good God's good and
8:35
on not so good days you're like complaining and you're a different person completely and you're not staying
8:43
in the truth so that heart is not a mature heart God's looking for mature love
8:54
not puppy dog love like in when we're teenager when you're in teenagers many times
8:59
except for Demery she's mature in the spirit I was a teenager like it's like you get
9:06
crushes and it's like and all that and then you're like I
9:12
wasn't in love like you're just emotions are fickle and and so
9:18
God God's not looking for fickle emotions of love for him he's looking
9:24
for a mature love now David he could see David's heart
9:31
before David went through so many crazy trials God looks at the heart God was looking
9:38
at David's heart and he could see this is a mature love
9:43
this is a love for me that will remain constant that when life is going very
9:49
going very hard for him when so many enemies are against him he will not
9:54
forsake me that David he won't he will still trust me he will still
10:01
praise me he will still serve me that's real love
10:06
that's mature love that's a that's a Man on Fire for me
10:14
that's what God's looking for that kind of mature love he's looking
10:19
for are you so serious about pleasing God
10:25
that your heart's like I just want to please God that's it not on one day I'll do anything for God
10:33
and you're doing all these things for God and the next day you don't feel like it and you don't do anything for God
10:39
no God's looking not at your emotions not if every day you're super excited
10:45
feeling to serve God and Obey him but he's looking are you consistent
10:50
let me see your love through your actions that's what God's looking at
10:58
God had to teach me this I'm telling you one of the biggest schemes of the devil is to lie to you
11:07
and make you think that you are not on fire for God and make you think that you
11:12
do not have a good relationship with God because not every day you're not feeling you're not feeling that crazy passion
11:19
that you've maybe had before the devil wants to make you think you've lost your passion You've Lost Your Fire
11:26
The Devil Makes wants to make you think that you cannot be used by God because you're not as on fire as as ministers
11:33
that you see maybe you look at me and you think I cannot do what she's doing because she's
11:38
super on fire and passion all the time and I'm not that way but let me tell you so many times when I
11:44
get up and preach I don't feel like it so many times I'm sometimes I'm tired sometimes I don't feel even I don't feel
11:51
the passion about what I'm to preach but that's not what being on fire is is
11:58
feeling that but when I when I go to preach I I remind myself God's called me to do this this word
12:05
that he's entrusting me to preach he's leading me to preach it's truth that will set people free
12:11
and maybe I don't feel as passionate about in this moment but it is life or death for people if they receive this
12:16
word they're going to be set free from this word and so therefore this is an important
12:21
word no matter how I'm feeling about it I've maybe I feel like chilling and I'm okay
12:27
I preached this and I preach this I preached many different things maybe that's how I feel but people need to hear this word
12:34
God is counting on me to release this word so I will preach this word with with
12:41
conviction with boldness with confidence whether I feel it or not
12:50
we are let me tell you this is a really powerful secret right here of how to always stay on fire
12:55
the real you is a spirit say I am a spirit
13:01
meaning that Jesus when you gave your life to Jesus you became a new creation
13:06
the old you was crucified with Jesus and the new you came alive was was
13:12
resurrected with Jesus so you became new you are a new person that you weren't
13:17
before Jesus so before you gave your life to Jesus so you now you are a spirit that's what came alive
13:24
and that spirit is what lives eternally your body does not live eternally go it
13:30
goes in the ground but the real you goes in heaven
13:35
eternally with Jesus so that's the real you and then your spirit it has a soul
13:42
which is your mind your will and your emotions
13:47
your mind your will and your emotions your feelings and then you also live in a physical
13:54
body this tent here on Earth that is temporary it's just what houses the real
14:00
you of the spirit Hallelujah so
14:07
how we should be how God wants it to be in the spiritual realm is for your your
14:12
spirit to be leading the rest of you following the Holy Spirit your spirit
14:18
follows the Holy Spirit and then the rest of you needs to get in line needs
14:24
to follow the spirit so in other words your feel your feelings your soul will
14:31
many times be of the flesh be of the world I feel tired I don't feel passionate about this word of God I I
14:40
just want to do something else or something right that's your soul but the soul does not have to be your
14:45
truth does not have to be the real you it does not have to lead and take over and win
14:50
the spirit can so when you when you make the spirit lead
14:58
you're asking Holy Spirit what do you want what is your will
15:03
and so for example the example I gave about even preaching with passion um when you're not feeling like it uh
15:10
you you you see the word of God you see this is this is life this is going to
15:15
set people free this is going to deliver people the people need to hear this word and
15:21
God has entrusting me to deliver this word so I must preach this with passion and
15:28
boldness and confidence so you gotta get in line
15:36
and then the Soul is forced to follow when you really are intentional Spirit
15:42
must lead we must do what God says whole body amen the soul really will lead this is
15:49
what happens to me every time this is what happens to me many times when I preach this is what this is how I be
15:54
that this is how I I'm able to have victory over the devil this is how I'm able to be patient when it's hard this
16:01
is how I'm able to hold my tongue when it's hard this is how is be this is being spiritual right here
16:09
is to get in line Spirit Soul bodies Spirit leading following the voice of the Holy Spirit
16:14
and this is biblical this is what what this is what David did it says
16:21
um it says
16:28
Psalm Psalm 43 Verse 5. this is the passion translation so David was going through such a hard time had Saul was
16:35
trying to kill him this was as hard of a time as it could ever get and and he says then I will say
16:43
to my soul don't be discouraged don't be disturbed
16:49
for I fully expect my savior God to break through for me then I'll have plenty of reasons to praise him all over
16:54
again let me repeat that then I will say to my soul so what I just taught you is
17:01
biblical it's straight from the Bible
17:06
this is what he was doing then I will say to my soul so my spirit is in the this my spirit must lead must follow the
17:13
holy spirit so you got to get in line so I will say that's your spirit that's the real you saying
17:20
I will say to my soul so the Soul at that moment wanted to
17:26
give up that soul in that moment was so depressed was weeping was full of pain
17:34
was feeling like God where are you wanting to scream out and get mad at God even that's what the soul was saying but
17:42
he says I will say to my soul I'm gonna put my soul in its place
17:53
don't be weary God is good don't be disheartened so God is good
18:00
so this is what you do this is a big key of how to always be on fire you're not always going to feel on fire you have a
18:07
soul and you will feel tired you'll have feelings of being depressed you'll have feelings of being sad you'll have
18:12
feelings of giving up you'll have all of these feelings and the devil is a liar and he's going to be speaking these
18:18
things in your soul but you need to constantly be speaking
18:24
to your soul I get so excited when I preach this
18:29
message because I remember all many times when I preach this message I'm even feeling tired before I preach it or
18:34
I'm not feeling like preaching it and as I preach it I feel my whole body come alive and full of passion because what
18:41
happens is when you make your spirit to lead so get in line you body We are
18:47
following God instead of I'm gonna go with my feelings
18:52
instead you be spiritual you say so get in line body get in line what happens is
18:59
is your soul starts living in the truth those weighty feelings
19:05
they fall off because God is more powerful than your soul
19:10
God's truth prevails over the devil's lies he's speaking to you
19:15
if you can choose to believe that truth and stand firm in that truth
19:21
the soul has no chance so you speak to your soul get in line
19:27
get in line and your soul starts to actually feel the feelings of
19:33
on fire I feel passionate I feel passionate and
19:38
then the body gets in in line when your soul leads you are you feel uh
19:45
depressed you feel uh discouraged well what if you if your Soul's leading
19:50
you're not doing anything about it you're letting it lead what happens is your body follows you stay in bed instead of go to church are you just you
19:57
just feel tired but when you make your spirit to lead your soul to submit this the feelings
20:05
literally do follow this is a spiritual principle it's amazing your feelings really do follow
20:11
you start to feel what you're speaking that truth the truth of God and then
20:16
your body literally follows and you feel energetic
20:22
Hallelujah Hallelujah but remember that it's not
20:29
um it's not your feelings you're feeling what you're feeling does not determine if you're on fire for God if your
20:35
relationship or God is good or not no that's the blessing that comes the feelings are a blessing that comes when
20:42
you do that spiritual work when you be spiritual to make the spirit man to lead and the soul to follow that's a blessing
20:50
we do not need the feelings ever amen we do not need the feelings to be on fire
20:56
for God we do not need to have the feelings for God to see that you love him
21:02
and this is a sneaky way that the devil tries to make uh Christians defeated and
21:08
and think that their relationship with God isn't isn't good enough and that you can't serve God
21:16
the Devil comes in your mind and and comes and says you're you're not feeling passionate
21:22
about God you're not feeling passionate about his work and you're not praying passionate prayers so come with those
21:28
stupid lives and this is a trial I had to go through I mean this is a something that God
21:35
really taught me because I would notice that whenever I had the feelings when when things were going so good in life
21:41
when God's blessings were like super evident in my life blessing blessing blessing God blesses us every day but
21:47
there's some days where they're extra evident so there's there there would be days where the blessings are just pouring and
21:54
I'm like Jesus Jesus and I feel
21:59
feel so passionate for God and whenever I would feel so passionate for God I
22:06
would literally feel like like rest like yes
22:11
my relationship with God is good ah I can rest
22:16
oh I'm in love with God and he can see I'm in love with him ah
22:22
phew I feel I feel content in my relationship with God and and I'm I can
22:27
do this what God's called me to do yes I can do what he's called me to do to be an apostle yes I can do this because I
22:33
feel passionate I would feel that and then there would be days where the
22:40
blessings weren't maybe as evident the the trials in life there's still blessings but they're just not in your
22:46
face as much and we're human we're human we're human David everyone the greatest
22:52
people of Faith it's never going to feel good or fun to go through trials to go through persecution it's always going to
22:59
sting there's always going to be pain there's never going to be a natural feeling
23:05
of Happiness there um and so I would notice when I would go through those times and I would just
23:11
feel like you know my prayers are more like I love you God thank you God you know they weren't these like big
23:17
passionate prayers and I just I was still content I was still
23:22
um I still loved God so much I knew the truth and I knew I was fully surrendered to God but I just didn't feel that
23:28
overflowing emotion and I would feel so discouraged in my relationship with God
23:35
I would feel like oh I I think I'm far from maybe maybe I'm far from God and
23:42
um maybe I'm not doing good enough I would hear it looking back I know what was the devil lying to me
23:48
the devil lying to me trying to make me insecure about my relationship with God
23:54
trying to make me doubt my love for God trying to make me doubt that God and I
24:00
are close he's a liar he's a liar he's a liar
24:05
but the real you is you on your best day
24:12
that's who God sees the real you is you on your very best day
24:17
with all the feelings of passion and joy that's the real you don't get down on yourself when you feel
24:24
tired when you don't feel yourself God's not uh looking at you like a
24:32
performance he's looking at your heart the maturity of your heart
24:38
God's looking if if you you'll still serve him when it's hard when you're tired
24:43
if you'll still thank him and praise him when things are not going well one thing
24:49
when it's hard will you still even if it's a mother thank you God you're good I trust you
24:55
that's what he's looking at not your emotions that's what he's
25:00
looking at Hallelujah Hallelujah
25:06
thank you Jesus
25:12
God wants you to always be confident in his room and in your relationship with him know that any time that you're doubting
25:19
that is the devil the devil trying to bring you far from
25:25
God and when you're in those moments where things are harder or you're just going through a harder day
25:31
run to God I love you God I know you're here I
25:36
trust you I thank you you're faithful run to him do not listen to the devil's
25:43
voice of saying you're far from God you should have shame because of your lack of passion right
25:48
now that's the devil's aim and then that becomes this cycle where
25:53
now it's been a long time since you've spent time with God don't let the devil win a single day
26:00
you run to Jesus every day knowing he's there no matter how you're feeling he's there proud of you full of love for
26:08
you no matter your feelings no matter your feelings
26:14
Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause]
26:20
this is so important to know because especially when we have our first encounters with God like when I had my
26:25
first encounter with God when I had my first when I first surrendered I really did have those feelings on fire I just
26:32
thought [Music] but now it's been years and now it's
26:37
it's more of this just maturity and constant serving God and I still carry
26:44
that passion and fire but it's this mature love and it's not before it was
26:50
led by feelings before the telling people about Jesus was led by feelings
26:56
but now telling people about Jesus serving God comes from deep within my truth my
27:03
Covenant with God that I surrendered to him and I serve you Lord every day of my life that's where it comes from
27:10
Hallelujah
27:19
so um I want to now share a couple um keys of how to keep the the fan of
27:26
flame within you um so this number one the biggest thing
27:32
is that principal I taught you about Spirit soul body Spirit that's my biggest secret I can
27:39
give you of how I'm literally by the grace of God able to preach Minister for
27:47
hours several days a week flying from Switzerland and here
27:53
like that every every week since August every week since August I've traveled
27:59
I've ministered every single Sunday here we have about three hour services and um I've Minister different states or
28:06
countries between one one to four or five times a week so
28:12
I'm I'm Minister I've been ministering between two to like six times depending
28:17
on the week every single week and travel in between internationally and all since August
28:23
and by the grace of God I've never had to miss
28:28
um even I lost my voice one time and I was preaching like this y'all remember that when you're here and Divas were
28:35
still going glory to God um because it's not about our feelings it's not about our our physical state
28:43
amen but it's about the spirit in you and you just obeying God and standing strong and sin and in the truth no
28:49
matter how you're feeling um but I've been able to to do it with passion to preach with passion
28:56
with confidence um and trying to give the best I can every week since August so many times
29:03
and and this is my biggest secret this Spirit soul body this speaking to
29:09
my soul again and again and again speaking to my soul again and again
29:16
speaking to my soul again and again this I'm telling you this principle is
29:22
true the soul has to submit the soul has to submit to God's will
29:31
this is how to be on fire all the time Hallelujah and what's
29:38
really amazing is that at first it might be like you have to do it a lot like you
29:44
have to be speaking to your soul a lot and that's because you are not very spiritual yet
29:51
we are in a process from from um being very soulish being very carnal
29:58
to becoming very spiritual like Jesus he says be perfect as I'm perfect I mean
30:04
it's possible to become very much very much like Jesus very very much like almost the same like we can be we can we
30:11
have so much growing that we can do so we're in this process from going from carnal to spiritual so much like Jesus
30:19
so um some of you in the beginning it'll be it'll be more of a task because you're
30:25
more carnal so your soul is stronger and your spirit's smaller but as you keep
30:31
speaking to your soul again and again and again literally your flesh dies
30:36
it diminishes it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and your spirit man literally arises so
30:43
much so that I've gotten to the point that I don't have to speak to my soul that much anymore
30:48
like my spirit has become so much stronger that I rarely feel feelings
30:54
um that are different from God's feelings of peace and joy and contentness amen
31:01
so is this a blessing of Abundant Life that God's promised us that
31:06
um man we really can be bursting with energy and joy
31:11
every day we re we really can't with Jesus is possible if we can become more spiritual if we
31:18
can be disciplined in the spirit amen and this is how we can Shine the brightest for God this is how he can use
31:24
us to the maximum he can use us even more so this is the number one way of how to
31:31
constantly be on fire for God and remember it's not your feelings because when you think it's your feelings that
31:37
will make you less on fire because you'll be discouraged so always always reject the devil's lies
31:43
saying that you're not feeling on fire you should feel bad about yourself always reject that lie and say I am
31:49
passionate about my Lord Jesus I'm in love with him I'm surrendered to
31:54
him I'm sold out for him and I'm serving him every day of my life I'm on fire for Jesus I'm full of zeal
32:01
I'm full of passion that's the truth amen
32:06
Hallelujah that's the big one and number two um keep coming to church where real
32:12
anointing is keep coming what real anointing is who here feels a little more alive or a lot
32:18
more alive just just hearing the message right now Hallelujah
32:23
hallelujah hallelujah you know it's not just your soul that's been fed you can listen to
32:30
Ted Talks inspirational talks you can go to concerts secular concerts you can go
32:36
uh to hear preachers that do not have anointing and your soul will be fed
32:42
maybe you shed a tear you feel inspired but it doesn't last
32:47
it's just your souls so so so so maybe you felt a little down that day and then your soul was fed oh I feel better next
32:54
day you feel bad again that's your soul being fed but you need your spirit to be fed the real you your
33:02
spirit that's what changed everything for me my testimony of how it was set in fires because finally my spirit was fed
33:09
my spirit was touched it was touched Inside by God by the power fire it came
33:19
alive and I never lost that fire from that day because I stayed where anointing is
33:25
I stayed where anointing is and my my spiritual father he carries
33:31
Mighty anointing shortly after I was ignited that day and I surrendered I became under that covering and I've
33:37
received that anointing received impartation so I've stayed in that place of anointing myself and now I can carry
33:43
that anointing and release it to you and so you're why you feel alive here is
33:51
because the anointing is touching your spirit man inside you can't get that
33:56
outside of the church where the anointing is this is why we need the church that says
34:02
that the body of the the body of Christ was given the fivefold ministry Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers to edify to equip your spirits
34:10
being edified anointed teaching anointing being released is coming and edifying your
34:16
spirit making it come alive feeding it so never miss church for the sake of
34:24
yourself for the sake of your spiritual health if you want to be on fire for God never
34:31
miss church never miss online if you're online never miss a Sunday if you're here never miss it it should be the
34:36
priority it's where the most important part of you the real you your spirit is getting fed
34:44
and so you you receive this anointing and and your spirit's being fed and it
34:49
it it it it is literally helping you throughout your week now it's helping you overcome the devil your
34:55
spirit now is stronger because of that anointing that you've received it's helping you be strong in the spirit
35:01
it's helping you stay in the spirit it's helping you defeat the Devil schemes over your lives daily because you're
35:08
continually coming where anointing is being released you're planted it says in the Bible
35:14
um Jeremiah 17 8 Amplified version Jeremiah 17 8 for he will be nourished
35:20
like a tree planted By the Waters that spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear the heat when it comes but
35:27
Elite but its leaves will be green and moist and it will not be anxious and concerned in a year of drought nor stop
35:33
bearing fruit the revelation of this passage is speaking about being planted where God's
35:41
power is moving in his true church every believer is called to be actually
35:46
planted in a church it can be online too if you're not in person
35:51
but to be planted where that anointing is Flowing so you're continually receiving that anointing to feed your
35:57
spirit you're not doing it buffet style like I was that doesn't work in the spiritual realm that's not they'll never work in
36:03
the spiritual Realm it's it's just like your soul being fed the the spirit being fed comes from the
36:10
planting the continually spirit being fed and growing and receiving impartation to walk in God's power comes
36:18
from being planted chantal's adorable she's so passionate about this because
36:25
Hallelujah she's been planted for a long time now and she's seen the fruit of come here
36:33
I just feel the spirit of God upon you now to just release a word right now just share just share a quick testimony
36:39
being planted okay I didn't expect it but yeah I get so so
36:44
passionate about this about people being planted where the power of God is moving because I know I've experienced it for
36:51
myself the change the transformation that happens when you are consistently
36:56
receiving the anointing in your life and you're staying in one spot you're not going here over here over there over
37:03
there but you are saying I am going to consistently receive from this anointing it literally transforms your life in
37:10
ways that you cannot even express like I actually like received freedom and
37:18
deliverance by just being planted by just consistently serving all the time
37:23
and just never leaving that's how I receive Freedom that's how I was transformed I knew Jesus my whole entire
37:30
life but the time that I actually stayed still and was planted where the
37:36
anointing of God is moving that's the key where the anointing of God is moving and you stay still that's when I changed
37:43
that's when I was transformed so I get so passionate when you find a church
37:50
where the power of God is moving where the anointing is don't let it go it is
37:56
the most precious thing you can ever find it is not something you find everywhere so when you find it hold on
38:04
to it like it's the most precious gem that you've ever received because that's
38:09
what it is and when you find it stay still amen
38:15
hallelujah hallelujah and then as you as you stay as you're
38:21
receiving this anointing now you need to do your spiritual work throughout your everyday your spiritual work of sane in
38:28
relationship with God of continuing to seek Him abstain in his word of praying in the spirit
38:35
the baptism of the Holy Spirit it says it's for the edit to edify your spirit
38:41
the gift of the baptism of the holy spirit is to edify your spirit the gift of Prophecy is to edify others but the
38:48
the gift of the baptism Holy Spirit the gift of tongues is to edify your spirit
38:54
so these are the things that that make your spirit to become strong in your flesh to go down
38:59
to keep seeking uh the things of God stop putting your stop putting your your
39:06
eyes on the things of the world don't watch too many movies or something that are worldly or Too Much music that's
39:12
worldly get your eyes off of that and keep your eyes on the things of God on
39:18
God and that's what helps make your spirit come stronger than the carnal man
39:23
only speaking truth only speaking God's will only speaking
39:30
his word so when when you feel like you won't get
39:37
better you speak Isaiah 53 5. boy he was wounded for our
39:42
transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities by his stripes we are healed you should write these down like when I
39:49
am having these feelings this is what I must speak instead of speaking death instead of speaking I feel sick I feel
39:55
awful life is horrible you speak God's truth this is how you speak to your soul
40:00
amen when you don't seem to have enough money to pay your bills you speak he is my
40:06
provider Philippians 4 19 and my God will liberally Supply your every need
40:12
according to his riches in Christ Jesus when you are feeling you're not sure if your dreams will come true you speak his
40:20
plans for me are good and prosperous Jeremiah 29 11 for I know the plans I
40:25
have for you declares the Lord Prince plans to prosper you not to harm you plans to give you hope in a future when you feel fear you speak I have the
40:33
mind of Christ which is full of courage and strength God did not give me a
40:39
spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind second Timothy 1 7 for God has not given me a spirit of fear but a
40:46
power of love and a sound mind when you feel like you'll never have more than enough you say he wants me to have
40:53
abundance John 10 10 the thief comes to seal kill and destroy but Jesus has come
40:58
that they may have and enjoy life and have it in abundance when you feel like a certain Miracle
41:05
won't happen you speak nothing shall be impossible Luke 1 37 for with God nothing shall be
41:15
impossible Hallelujah so you speak the truth and this makes
41:21
your spirit come alive really to be on fire is to just have your spirit man be strong and the flesh go down and the
41:27
last one is to pray in the spirit praying in the spirit praying in the tongues edifies your spirit
41:34
this is why this is a gift for every single believer God wants every single
41:39
believer to have so you can have this tool to Fan your spirit man into Flame
41:46
this is part of Fanning it into the flame so when you pray in the spirit you're speaking directly to God Holy
41:52
Spirit to the spirit you're speaking God's will to be done also and you are having intimacy with the
41:59
Holy Spirit and you are in the spiritual realm you're literally Fanning your spirit man into Flame
42:07
there's been times when I pray in the spirit when I feel tired of praying the spirit and I feel energetic because it's
42:13
the spirit soul body so we're going into the spirit we're praying in the spirit right now
42:18
soul and body must follow so pray in the spirit throughout your
42:24
days make it a discipline make it a practice even not religious but make it
42:29
a like I get an i to make sure I don't forget to do it every day I'll if I'm in the shower if I'm in the car if I have
42:37
just idle time somewhere I pray in the spirit you can pray even under your tongue
42:43
sometimes sometimes I have the urge to do it in public I can do it under my lips a little bit and quiet
42:49
but do it with this Revelation I'm edifying my spirit man right now
42:55
I'm speaking to the Holy Spirit I'm having intimacy with God have that Revelation as you pray in the spirit
43:01
amen so it doesn't become something boring or something to you this is beautiful this is beautiful gift amen
43:08
hallelujah Hallelujah
43:14
and um you know this word that Revival is now was given
43:22
years ago a few years ago and this is it was spoken to our church when there was just John Hall was there
43:30
Vivian was there Fred Fred was there I think about yeah Fred was there Vivian Fred was there they were there
43:36
the three of them were here when we heard that word and our church was only like 10 people or so
43:43
um 15 something like that and um from that day I was convicted that God was was was
43:51
calling me to keep the fire alive that at that moment there had been a flame
43:57
that was deposited a Revival flame that was deposited to our church to LA to
44:03
this nation into the world it wasn't the world yet but it was it was in LA it was in a church it was
44:09
there it was a flame that was deposited with that prophetic word and God spoke to me that I must keep
44:16
this flame alive for it to be able to spread
44:22
and so we kept that fan of flame we kept saying every Sunday I think I think
44:28
every probably every Sunday right Fred and maybe it was every Sunday I think every single Sunday welcome
44:35
everyone Revival is no with 10 people five people Fred would
44:43
play his base Chantal was leading worship I was leading worship we do Friday worship nights sometimes no one came sometimes it was just John doll's
44:49
dad um that was it and we did have the live stream with maybe two people watching if that and we would still say Revival is
44:58
no with passion well it was more like Revival is now you
45:05
know but it was it was with passion conviction amen even though when I said
45:10
that word I felt discouraged but I spoke to my soul with that word I
45:16
felt discouraged as I looked out in the crowd years later after saying that word every week and not seeing Revival what
45:23
Revival I think looks like but okay God set us now so it's now we're gonna see
45:28
what Revival I think looks like anytime now but I felt discouraged I know we all did I know Jean tall but we would felt I
45:35
would fight back tears do in the worship night sometimes Revival is now I would fight back tears
45:42
when people would leave but I would get on that stage with a smile revivals now this is not being fake this is staying
45:50
on fire for Jesus saying in the truth
45:57
Hallelujah and we we wrote that song Revival is now I think was it two years
46:02
after the word Professor a year and a half maybe a year and a half almost two years was July so it's almost two years
46:08
after hearing that prophetic word we sat down and wrote that song when we had not seen any fruit of Revival yet
46:15
we wrote that song the Bible is now your kingdom is here
46:21
we wrote that song we we believed it we stayed on fire we kept the fire alive
46:28
and so that that flame was there glory to God that flame it didn't go out but
46:34
what happened what would happen if the flame went out because really this is this is a result
46:40
of the prophetic word being released and then carrying it it's not some random happenstance thing
46:47
that happened it's because a prophetic word was released there was obedience we carried
46:53
it like Moses you know like Moses had to go follow you God and I declare this
46:58
word it wasn't just random that the people of Israelites were delivered the Israelites
47:03
were delivered it was because obedience it was because believing in the prophetic word it was
47:09
keeping the flame alive so this all happened from keeping a flame
47:14
alive Hallelujah and that flame
47:22
eventually spread to a wildfire of hundreds coming here every single week
47:29
since since last May and this revival spreading across the world 25 Nations
47:36
coming to the Revival events in Switzerland this week that little flame has spread like a wildfire
47:45
I remember that word that that my spiritual father said when they released that word he says it only takes one
47:50
Spark One Flame to spread a whole wildfire
47:55
One Flame so imagine what God can do with your One Flame
48:01
imagine what even collectively God can do with our if God could do what he did was just my flames on tall Vivian Fred
48:08
with our little Flames four Flames what about all of our Flames I'm seeing
48:15
stadiums of thousands of people being set free
48:21
because there was 200 or 300 whoever however many is here a few hundred
48:26
people here with flames that are consistent every week keeping the fan alive there are so many people in the
48:33
world that have not known the truth of Jesus have not met him have not encountered his power of not been
48:39
delivered so I'm keeping my fan a flame alive for them so we can spread like a
48:45
wildfire and reach them the thousands the millions the millions the end time Revival is now this is so small compared
48:54
to what God's about to do but Hallelujah but he's only gonna do the
48:59
big when we keep these fans aflame all of us we keep showing up week after week
49:06
that scripture about being planted is like it's being like planted by a stream it also is this way there's like a huge
49:14
bonfire here you want to stay hot and not get cold come close to the fire
49:21
come to where the bonfire is you'll be I'm Leaving On Fire
49:27
keep coming where the fire is so we can spread this revival across the entire world reach billions more people amen
49:36
so so thousands are pouring in to Revival in the Park in LA thousands are pouring in we get Dodger
49:43
Stadium over there we got a lot of stadiums in La we can fill up amen
49:49
are we ready to keep the fire aflame Hallelujah Revival is now
49:57
Revival is now Hallelujah
