hi I'm Apostle Catherine Crick welcome
to another episode of Revival is now on
this episode you will learn how to
experience God's presence in your daily
life how to experience God's presence
well first of all when you give your
life to Jesus the Holy Spirit comes and
lives inside of you so that's God
himself makes his home
in your temple of your body if you've
given your life to Jesus
God lives in you right now
my earliest memory was age four my
parents asking me if I want to
officially accept Jesus in my heart in
my life as my Lord and Savior now and I
remember saying yes and
just saying a prayer repeating words
after them
and
from that day I have always known God
I've always loved God I've always had
faith in God there was never a day I
didn't doubt his existence or his love
for me but as I entered High School I
started hungering to have a relationship
with God I started hearing people talk
about having relationship with God and I
didn't really know what that meant I
just believed in God and had faith in
him and would say prayers you know
nightly at the dinner table and went to
church but that was about it I had Faith
but that was it then I started hearing
about relationship that you could have a
relationship with God
and and when I heard that I was like I
was hungry I was like I want that I want
to know God more intimately
so from there I was on a journey of
seeking God the Bible says that when you
seek God and seek him with all of your
heart then you will find him
so I thank God that he put a hunger in
me and that made me want to seek him
more so I could find him in his fullness
so fast forward into my mid-20s I
encountered the power of God for the
first time
meaning I saw people receive Miracles
people be healed people be delivered I
received prophetic words for the first
time in my life and instantly my eyes
open up like never before in the
spiritual realm to God's nearness and
his love
and his love for me intimately me and I
Baptism of the Holy Spirit
was and then I was baptized in the Holy
Spirit now in Acts 2 1 it says when the
day of Pentecost came they were all
together in one place suddenly a sound
like the blowing of a violent wind came
from heaven and filled the whole house
where they were sitting they saw what
seemed to be tongues of fire that
separated and came to rest on each of
them all of them were filled with the
Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
tongues as the spirit enabled them so
this is what happened to the original
disciples the Holy Spirit came upon them
in Fire and as you continue to read the
book of Acts there's other examples of
when the Holy Spirit came upon people
where they had been baptized in water
they believed in Jesus but they hadn't
had the Holy Spirit come upon them and
began speaking in new tongues so this
actually shows us that the baptism of
the holy spirit is separate and
different from the baptismal of water
and the baptism of the holy spirit is
something that God wants for every
single one of his believers
the baptism of the holy spirit is simply
more of holy spirit it's Holy Spirit
coming in fire it's Holy Spirit igniting
you igniting your spirit and its Holy
Spirit taking over more of you I when I
received about some Holy Spirit I was in
a place of just ready to surrender to
God just so hungry and so Desiring more
of him and ready to surrender my whole
life finally
and that's when it came that's when I
received it and when I received it I
began speaking in tongues
immediately speaking in Newton
and when that happened I it was like the
best thing that had ever happened to me
in my life I just I just my spiritual
eyes opened up and it's like I just knew
and loved God more than ever before I
could see his love clearly for me like
never before and just that Supernatural
Encounter of the baptism Holy Spirit it
just gave me this knowing
that God is
all-powerful he is so Majestic
he is the lord of the universe
and he loves me so much and he's so near
to me and he's with me right now giving
me a new tongue and it was just this
knowing I I believed all these things
before but this deep knowing Came Upon
me
and I was set on fire from that day my
spiritual eyes opened up the Revelation
in the spiritual realm that I had just
increased so much of God's love and who
he is and I've never been the same since
that day
and my love for God only grew my
surrender only grew so I'm sharing with
you right now how to experience God's
presence every single day
not just once in a while
um and first of all the first the first
thing I'm gonna the first part is to
give your life to Jesus and the Holy
Spirit will come and live inside of you
his presence is now in you right there
it right then and there
secondly
surrender to Jesus because many times
when people first give their lives to
Jesus it's like day one of believing day
one of deciding yes I want to make you
Lord Of My Life
but then as time goes on your love
increases in your Revelation increases
as you seek God more and get to know him
more until you get to a place where
your
ready and Desiring to surrender every
part of your life
there's a difference between saying
Jesus your lord of my life I believe you
and here you can take my life
there's a difference between that and
your eyes opening up more and more and
more until you're in your in the depths
of your heart you desire to give God
everything every part of your life your
will your dreams your plans your desires
your preferences everything
so many times and this was a this is
from my case the baptism of the holy
spirit it's a second in feeling of the
Holy Spirit and that comes when you're
ready to get everything and also when
you're unashamed of the Holy Spirit and
open and hungry for the baptism of the
Holy Spirit some of you like me did not
grow up knowing about that that's the
holy spirit so you have to get to a
place where your
your you have an open heart and you
don't have it uh anything holding you
back any like skepticism but you're just
like Lord I want more of you I want this
baptism the Holy Spirit that's when he
comes in Fire and baptizes you in his
spirit before I was baptized in the Holy
Spirit my revelation of God of his love
it was
it was so much smaller than what it was
after I was baptized in the Holy Spirit
and after I was baptized in the Holy
Spirit I was able to really
experience God's presence
so much so much more than before First
First Corinthians 2
Corinthians 2 4 says Paul says my
message and my preaching were not with
wise and perspective words but with a
demonstration of the spirit's power so
that your faith might not rest on human
wisdom but on God's power
so tall saying I didn't come to you
preaching without God's anointing God's
power in me I didn't come to you just
saying you should believe in Jesus and
this is why and okay are you ready to
read repeat a prayer after me and give
your life to Jesus he's saying no I
didn't do that but instead I was a
vessel who carried and carried anointing
carried the power of God and when I
spoke I spoke simply but the power of
God was there and was flowing through me
and touching the people and I
demonstrated the power of God
I baptized people in the Holy Spirit I
prophesied I cast out a demon I heal the
sick I release the anointing and people
experienced the power and presence of
God and so Paul's saying
so that your faith would not rest on
man's words but that your faith would
rest on God's power for me I had grown
up in church I went to church about at
least twice a week every week of my
whole life pretty much
and
my faith was rested on man's words
but I hadn't really had this tangible
real encounter where God became so real
and present to me rather than being far
away but I believe in him
and then I encounter God's power and he
became
so tangible when the baptism the Holy
Spirit came upon me I could literally
feel him for the first of my life
physically I mean like he was overtaking
my tongue that was Supernatural and that
was God
and that was the first I literally felt
him and that was the first time and so
like in that moment my faith became
rested on his power on God himself on my
experience my tangible experience
encounter I had with him rather than a
person talking about him
alone
so this is what we want this is what we
want we want people people should you
should be having your own encounters
with God so your faith is so strong and
is really based on relationship with God
the realness that you've really met him
and not just heard about him
what happens when you encounter God in
power
the baptism Holy Spirit
the power of God touches you you fall
back and you're healed you're delivered
a prophetic word
all these different ways that God comes
in power when you are touched like that
in power or you're just in a service for
example where the anointing's flowing
and you're touched and you're having a
tangible touch from God all of these
things they
open your eyes up in the spiritual realm
and it's like you they make you s it the
the the Encounters of God makes you
spiritual like it makes your faith real
it makes your faith big it makes you not
like this world and it changes you
forever one encounter with God's power
one encounter of God's power will change
you forever and ever
and it's like you don't even need you
don't need a prophetic word every day
you don't need a baptism the Holy Spirit
every day you don't need you don't need
to fall back with God's power every day
one time what could last you even a
lifetime I mean the change that it
brings the revelation of God's love and
nearness to you first of all once you
give your life to Jesus it's so
important for you to seek him more and
to
find where his power his anointing is
moving
position yourself to encounter his power
so that your spiritual eyes can open up
more so you can really meet
Jesus instead of just hear about him and
here's where you begin relationship with
him with someone you've really met and
really love and know that he loves you
so your faith has to rest on God's power
a real experience that's the first part
the second part is this
your relationship with God is based on
faith
your faith is based on God's power on
really meeting him encountering him
and then your relationship with God is
based on faith what I mean by that is
your relationships here on this Earth
are not based on faith your
relationships on this Earth are very
physical
now you can have spiritual relationships
but they're still physical and by that I
mean what what makes you feel close to a
person many times is having to do with
physical things like eye contact
a hug
audible voices but with god he's a
spirit
we don't see him physical or hear him
physical for the most part like we do
our relationships here on this Earth
your confidence in your relationships is
based on so many physical factors
hearing the audible voice of them speak
hugs seeing them in person
FaceTiming them what you have to
understand is that your relationship
with God is so so different from your
relationships on this Earth and before I
encountered the power of God
where I really met Jesus and my eyes
were opened up
I was insecure in my relationship with
God
I felt like I didn't know how to hear
his voice
I I I didn't feel close
and then all the while I would hear
other people say I heard God God told me
this God told me that
um so I would feel insecure about my
relationship with God I would feel
insecure like why don't I hear him
strongly am I not listening enough if
I'm not being quiet enough I would
wrestle with all of these thoughts
condemning thoughts um that it's my
fault that I'm not being a good enough
Christian and once my eyes opened up in
the spiritual Realm
God revealed to me that I was actually
projecting my relationships on Earth
upon God
and not realizing that they're so
different
you know God
chooses to not speak in an audible voice
most of the time there are some people
who who've heard his Audible Voice but
those who have heard of his Audible
Voice is usually just one or a couple
times so he doesn't usually speak an
audible voice and he also doesn't
usually appear physically he does
sometimes for specific purposes
but not to everybody and when it is to
people it's usually just one or maybe
two times that's it
so
this speaks something about God about
our relationship with him
that
you know it's not it's not hard for God
to speak to us audibly he could do it in
one second it's not hard for God to show
up
physically and just be with us
physically all the time he could do that
in one second
well why doesn't he do that
because our relationship with him is
based upon Faith he wants it that way
so after Jesus has resurrected and then
appeared to many of the disciples Thomas
didn't see Jesus and the other disciples
had and they told Thomas we have seen
the Lord but Thomas said to them unless
I see the nail marks in his hands and
put my finger where the nails were and
put my hand into his side I will not
believe a week later his disciples were
in the house again and Thomas was with
them through the doors though the doors
were locked Jesus came and stood among
them and said peace be with you then he
said to Thomas
then he said to Thomas
put your finger here see my hands reach
out your hand and put it into my side
stop doubting and believe Thomas said to
him my Lord and my God
then Jesus told them because you have
seen me you have believed blessed are
those who have not seen
and yet have believed
he calls those blessed
Faith
last
you cannot please God without faith
are
our relationship with God and how we
will be able to be the most powerful
vessel of God and fulfill our purpose on
this Earth is all based upon faith
faith faith faith is everything and we
can't cut corners
so our relationship with him is no
different
our relationship with God it builds our
faith the fact that it's based on faith
the fact that we can't see him
physically usually or hear him audibly
but have to believe and choose to
believe
that builds our faith and makes us
stronger spiritually so God can use this
even more powerfully I think you know
you you could ask yourself why doesn't
God just appear to us
Gods Presence
physically all the time and and audibly
speak to us why
and this is your answer here he says
blessed are you who believe without
seeing
so
if God chooses to appear to you and
speak to you that is so beautiful and
God will do that for a specific purpose
a reason why he wants to do that many
times is to build Faith many times is
because he's called something to some
he's called someone to something very
big and it's just important that they
they see him they see him physically or
they hear us out of a voice it's very
important for a big thing
that will come up ahead for their faith
to be strong but
it's not an indicator like if you've
seen Jesus physically or heard his
Audible Voice it doesn't make that
person
like a
a better Christian or anything it's
nothing like that and it doesn't make on
the other hand it doesn't make the
people who haven't seen or heard God
have stronger Faith because God didn't
have to appear them in that way it
doesn't mean either of those things but
I will say if if you have not
audibly heard God or
seeing him physically
Are You Blessed
take it as him saying blessed are you
blessed are you you are blessed you have
you have believed without seeing without
hearing audibly and
sometimes it does mean that God can
entrust you with this
like he knows that
if he doesn't appear to you physically
or talk to you audibly
you'll still believe you'll still stay
in there even in The Valleys when you
so badly want to hears out of a voice
and and see him physically but you hang
in there and you stand strong in faith
in your relationship with him and you
remain content with how he wants to
speak to you and with how he wants to
appear to you what you have to really
make sure is that you're not
um gauging your closeness to God based
on a physical feeling
Faith Not Feelings
it's not physical it's faith
the hearing from God the seeing him and
things the sensing his presence this is
all based on faith not feelings
there will be times when what happens in
the spirit
it transcends it goes to the soul into
the body where you actually feel him
physically God wants you to have those
moments
to build your faith and to meet him to
really meet Jesus have these experience
encounters and for me like that was the
baps of the Holy Spirit I also and
prophetic words he gave me and I
remember I received an invitation from
him and I fell back with God's power so
for me I've had these
experiences where I it went to the
Physical Realm even where you could
really you could feel God
and those are so special to me and dear
to me but they aren't every single day
and that's okay they're not supposed to
be every single day because remember
it's based on faith not feelings where
Christians can
go wrong is think that when you're
feeling something
then
God's presence is with you when you're
not feeling anything then God's presence
isn't there some people will be so
desperate for that feeling that they'll
they'll conjure up
they'll conjure up uh
a feeling or get maybe even sew in their
head because they want it so badly it's
Surrender Your Relationship
important we don't manipulate God or
that we are just looking to the feeling
rather than the person of Jesus
we need to respect Jesus and how he
wants to speak to us how he wants to
um how he wants to have a relationship
with us we have to let God lead he's the
leader of our relationship
not us and so it's important you don't
try to run the relationship and you
don't try to you know you just want to
hear God a certain way you just want to
see him a certain way maybe you
encountered him a certain way and you
just want to keep going there and and
having that same exact encounter again
and again when God wants us do a
different thing wants to speak to you in
a different way
so surrender your relationship with God
let go and allow God to lead in what
this relationship looks like and how his
voice comes and his presence how you
experience that what that looks like the
holy spirit is in you right now so often
we take it for granted and we forget we
forget this spiritual truth powerful
truth that Holy Spirit is in you right
now
that means God's presence is in you
right now
you don't have to wait for a Feeling
you don't have to wait for a loud voice
to speak
Holy Spirit God is in you right now
meditate on that truth renew your mind
with that truth
and just start to talk to God knowing
that he's there
you don't have to do something
God how do I get you to come here
I want to talk to you now can you come
from Heaven no he's here right now just
start talking to him just start just
forget everything that's going on around
you turn off your phone
and just put your eyes to him Look to
Him meditate on this truth this is this
is based on faith your relationship is
based on faith
ignite your faith he's here in me his
presence is with me
and begin to speak to him and begin to
just be with him begin to worship Him
begin to thank him that he his presence
is with you all the time if you've never
encountered God's power
he's going to come and touch you in
power right now and if you've never
received the baptism of Holy Spirit
God is going to pour out his spirit and
fire upon you right now just surrender
to Jesus close your eyes and surrender
and just tell God I want more of you
