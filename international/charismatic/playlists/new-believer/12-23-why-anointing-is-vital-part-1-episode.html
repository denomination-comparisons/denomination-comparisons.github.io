hi I'm Apostle Catherine Crick welcome
to another episode of Revival is now
anointing is the power of God that
destroys Yokes as it says in Isaiah 10
27 the Yoke shall be destroyed because
of the anointing today you will learn
why anointing is not only important but
it's actually crucial and vital in the
body of Christ the kingdom of God is not
a matter of talk but of power Jesus when
he came to this earth he demonstrated
his love by his power meaning he did not
just say I love you and leave it there
but every part of his expression of love
carried power in his words it was not
just ordinary words but he was full of
the power of God so when he spoke the
people could feel could know the love
that he was speaking of number two his
words full of power did not just end
with the words but there was action that
also carried power Jesus would see
people who were sick and oppressed and
he didn't just say I'll heal you I'll
deliver you I want this for you but he
actually did it he actually healed the
sick
and delivered the oppressed and when we
read the gospels when we look at the
ministry of Jesus it is so much action
whenever he's preaching the gospel
Miracles are always accompanying his
preaching healing Deliverance is always
there in fact it says in the word of God
that this is why he came to preach the
gospel and to cast out demons he went
around to many towns preaching and
casting out demons so there was never
just preaching but there was always this
action it was always he was always
preaching the kingdom of God is here the
kingdom of God is not a matter of talk
but but of power this is my love I've
come to save you I've come to save you
from the things you're suffering from
the bondage of the devil and now I'm
gonna do it Jesus would would preach it
and then he would do it he would deliver
the people heal the sick that's true
love a parent when they see their child
sick when they see their child suffering
the only thing that child wants in this
world at that moment is for the
suffering to be lifted the pain to be
relieved and so because the parent loves
the kid so much that becomes their
biggest want as well they are going to
do anything they can to help relieve the
suffering and pain of their child
so how much more for God he does not
want his children to be in bondage and
sick and suffering and he has the power
to help them to free them to heal them
so as we see in the gospels that is
exactly what he did he came in his
Supernatural power and relieved the
suffering cast out demons heal the sick
and that's a big meaning of the kingdom
of God is not a matter of talk but of
power Jesus means serious business
his love is such a strong force so much
that it's the greatest power you could
imagine a greater power than tornadoes
and hurricanes and earthquakes and
volcanoes
that's his love the highest degree of
power that can do anything to heal you
and free you and destroy the works of
the devil this is why Jesus said to the
disciples
go preach the gospel heal the sick cast
out demons raise the dead this is why
it's all together
go in power this is why Jesus said wait
until you receive the power of the Holy
Spirit do not go and preach without
power these disciples would have been
capable of sharing their testimony of
sharing in word what God had done but
Jesus says no you need my power to
demonstrate my love to the people to to
heal the sick to cast out demons to
relieve them from their suffering and
then we see Paul's Ministry
and so it was with me brothers and
sisters when I came to you I did not
come with eloquence or human wisdom as I
Proclaim to you the testimony about God
for I resolve to know nothing while I
was with you except Jesus Christ and him
crucified I came to you in weakness with
great fear and trembling my message and
my preaching were not with wise and
persuasive words but with a
demonstration of the spirit's power so
that your faith might not rest on human
wisdom but on God's power
why is the anointing vital why do we
need it in the body of Christ number one
we need the anointing so that others can
actually encounter Jesus my earliest
memory was giving my life to Jesus at
age four in the living room of the house
I grew up on with my parents and from
that day I never doubted in God's
existence and his love I never wanted to
turn away from him I always loved God
but my Christian upbringing consisted of
not knowing that God moved in power
never witnessing Miracles and I and and
not really thinking much about it when
it said that demons were cast out and
the sick were healed I don't know I
don't even remember thinking about it I
think maybe I thought it was just
history like it happened back then but
it doesn't happen anymore
I never doubted God but he was not
tangible to me so much it was more like
he was far away and I never really had
an encounter with Jesus it was more of
just a belief that he exists kind of
like how people believe in Santa Claus
it was more like I believe but I have
never had a tangible encounter with him
so when I was in high school I ended up
stepping one foot into the world and
beginning to live a lukewarm Christian
Life or I wasn't really having the fear
of God I wasn't fully surrendered I
still loved God and I was going to
church and and I love to talk about God
that was my favorite thing but I was
still living in the world I would still
party I would still have selfish desires
and go after them when I moved from
upstate New York to Los Angeles in 2013.
the moment I got to La God did something
in my heart he put hunger in me
he put a fire he put a hunger like this
hunger of
I really believe there's more of a God
and I want to discover more of God and
the Bible says that you will seek me and
find me when you seek me with your whole
heart
and that's my story I began to seek God
more than I ever had before I
encountered the power of God for the
very first time eyewitness people be
healed I witness demons manifesting in
people and being cast out for the first
time I received a prophetic word for the
first time in my life and it opened up
my eyes to God's nearness and that he
really has been with me and that he
really knows me I remember coming back
after witnessing the power of God moving
and really being touched by the power of
God for the first time through a
prophetic word where God became so real
and tangible like never before like wow
he's real he knows me he's been with me
I remember that day just saying out loud
to God in awe
guide before I believed in you I
believed you were real I believed you
loved me I believed your word was true
but now I know that you're real I know
that you love me so much I know that
your word is true and I know that the
plans you have for me are good
it was this deep knowing what happened
was because I actually encountered God
in power I had this tangible experience
with Jesus my spiritual eyes opened up
where before I was like I believe I
believe God's out there and he loves me
but I really
that's all that's about it but now it's
like my eyes that open up and no I
didn't see Jesus's face I didn't hear an
audible voice but in the spiritual realm
I could see like meaning
Jesus became as real as anything I could
touch or see this chair
in my life
I knew that I knew that I knew that he
was with me he loved me he he was
forming his word was true
I was never the same from that day
and a month later I was baptized in the
Holy Spirit and when I was baptized in
the Holy Spirit this was a way I had
physically encountered God for the first
time as my tongue is being overtaken by
the Holy Spirit
this was the first time I had
experienced something so physical
Supernatural in my body and
that experience and just the fire of God
coming upon me
it opened up my eyes in an even deeper
level to feel in my heart that all I
wanted to do was surrender to God
because a fear of God the fear of God
Came Upon me for the first time like
before it was like yeah I love God
like casual my whole life but but now it
was like as I imagine when we go to
heaven and we just see Jesus and we're
just like speechless and we can't talk
and we just
fall on the ground and worship him
you were holy you were holy you were
holy and that's all we can think
like it was a glimpse of that where I
knew like where all of a sudden the fear
of God Came Upon me
to see the lordship of Jesus and in that
moment I just felt like
who am I not to surrender to God who am
I and and who am I to think that my
plans could be better than God's it was
just this great Revelation this great
opening of my eyes
to see God so much more magnified than I
ever had before and in that result
seeing myself in humility so much
smaller than I ever had before
compared to God's lordship
and so in that moment
I surrendered to God my entire life and
it's all I wanted it's the only thing
that felt right I surrendered my dreams
my will my plans everything those things
I hadn't actually given up with my heart
like Lord I want you to have them take
them if they're not yours and give me
new dreams if you want whatever I
remember just feeling this desperation
like Lord the thing that I don't want
the most in the world you can even do
that you can I didn't like to be alone
and I was like you can send me to a
deserted island where there's nobody I
felt this desperation like Lord I
Surrender I really surrender I had been
wanting to surrender to God for years
like I was really realizing like man
I've been lukewarm I have one foot in
the world and this isn't right I I
understand that it's right to surrender
to God I don't want to be fake you know
I was already feeling that way but I was
stuck I didn't know why I was stuck I
didn't know why
I couldn't surrender I was going to a
huge church at the time and I was
hearing
kind of like such a similar message
every single week it was kind of like
the the Milky basic salvation message
and it was like every message was trying
to convince people this is why you
should believe in God and now do you
want to give your life to Jesus raise
your hand and I genuinely wanted to
surrender every time and I would raise
my hand and I would say yes Lord I'm all
in but week after week nothing was
changing in me
and I wasn't surrendering even though I
wanted to but when I encountered the
power of God for just a few times
I was then able to surrender for the
first time in my life after this
experience I can fully understand what
Paul means when he says this my message
and my preaching were not with wise and
persuasive words but with a
demonstration of the spirit's power so
that your faith might not rest on human
wisdom but on God's power you see I had
been hearing countless sermons several
times a week of wise and persuasive
words why isn't persuasive words
persuading people to believe in Jesus
but these messages did not contain the
power of God and so the reason I was
unable to surrender all that time was
that my faith was being based on man's
words even since I was a little child I
believed because my parents told me
there's nothing wrong with that I was
raised up to love the Lord It's a
beautiful thing but it's like I never
actually had an encounter with Jesus
with his power for my faith to be so
solid on him to rest on my experience my
encounter my personal encounter with him
so from the time I was a kid to now in
my 20s I was just hearing these wise and
persuasive words believe in Jesus you
should give your life to Jesus this is
why without power
and so my faith was resting there on the
words and so that's why my faith wasn't
able to be big enough to surrender
everything to Jesus but one day there
was a vessel who demonstrated the power
of God just like Apostle Paul says my
message and preaching were not with wise
and persuasive Force but with a
demonstration of the spirit's power
there was a vessel of God who carried
anointing and he demonstrated the
spirit's power and the word goes on to
say as Paul demonstrated the spirit's
power when he does then your faith will
not rest on human wisdom but on God's
power that's what happened for me
all of a sudden I am witnessing the
power of God how real Jesus is and whoa
revelation of his love for his people
that he wants to free his people that he
wants to heal his people that he knows
me and that he loves me and that out of
all things he could choose to speak
through a vessel he spoke such
encouragement and love to me through the
prophetic word and so my faith in that
moment was rested on God's power on my
encounter my real experience with him
and so when your faith rests on God on
his power then you're able to surrender
to Jesus in fact then it becomes easy to
surrender to Jesus to surrender to Jesus
went from being and from the moment I
surrendered that surrender has just
grown even just one encounter with God's
power where my spiritual eyes opened it
was enough to last me a very long time
even a lifetime I mean my eyes had
opened up and I couldn't unsee the
goodness the love the almightiness of
God it was enough for me to really
surrender and to stay in that place of
surrender and for that surrender to grow
to this day this was seven years ago
that I had this encounter with the power
of God for the first time and I still
get so excited to talk about it and I
remember from that day my biggest
passion became for everyone else in this
world to really encounter God in power
my heart immediately burned for the many
many Christian friends and family I
accumulated in different spheres of life
I knew that I was like kind of pretty
much the only person who would actually
encounter the power of God based on my
conversations with my friends and family
and I could see that all of my friends
and family were in the same place I was
before
not burning for Jesus and and perhaps
not truly surrendered because the
encounter with God's power was needed it
became my biggest passion and I never
imagined that God was going to use me
in power
to be like Paul and
be like my message to preaching were not
with wise and persuasive words but with
a demonstration of the power so that
your faith can rest on God's power I
didn't know God was going to use me to
help people encounter his power
but it did become my greatest passion
for others to Simply encounter God's
power I thought it was going to be me
just like inviting everyone to to come
to church where God's power was moving
but this became one of the confirmations
when I knew it was God speaking to me
about nine months after this when God
spoke through a prophet and said you're
called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
God's going to use you in Miracles one
of the big confirmations I knew that
even though I didn't want that I didn't
want to be a minister I didn't want to
be an apostle I didn't want to pray for
people I wanted to see people touch by
God's power but I didn't I felt shy and
inadequate and I don't know how to do
that I just wanted to cheer that people
were receiving Miracles and encounters
with God
but that was a big confirmation for me
that I knew it was God speaking because
that became my biggest passion Above All
Else above what my biggest Pursuit and
dream was of Music my biggest passion
became for others to actually encounter
God's power because that was the best
thing that happened to me in my life
that is the moment I fell in love with
Jesus before I loved Jesus but when I
actually met Jesus through that
Encounter of his power my eyes could
really see his love and when you see his
love he is irresistible
and you can't help but fall in love with
Jesus and I fell in love with Jesus that
moment that I encountered his power God
has chosen to put himself in vessels
this is the biggest way that he touches
his people is through
vessels in fact for me my biggest
encounters with Jesus including the ones
I just described all happened through a
vessel
it all happened by God's power his
anointing moving through
a vessel and touching me from
prophetic words
baptism of Holy Spirit impartation of
anointing they all came through a vessel
it's just how God's chosen for it to be
that he chooses to put himself in
vessels and touches people and so
because of that this is why anointing
is vital because since God chooses to
touch his people the most through people
we cannot have partial God in a vessel
we cannot have God just coming in words
but not power that's not even the
kingdom the kingdom of God's not about
to talk about a power that's that's why
I was missing Revelation and encounters
with Jesus for my whole life up till
seven years ago because I hadn't
encountered vessels who actually carry
the fullness of Jesus his anointing his
power it is God's will for every child
of God every vessel to carry him in his
fullness to carry his power
because this is how the most amount of
people in this world can will actually
have real encounters with Jesus so their
eyes can open up to his love fall in
love with him and give their lives to
him we as vessels of God should burn for
his anointing to come in our lives
because the more of Jesus in us the more
of his power the more of God that's
going to come out of you the more the
more people will encounter will really
encounter God's power in this earth we
need the anointing so people can
actually have encounters with Jesus you
know it wasn't just the Miracles the
supernatural experiences like the
Miracles that opened up my eyes to God's
love but it was also experiencing my
spirit my spirit man
coming alive by the anointed words
coming through other vessels I would
position myself to to receive true
anointed teaching and my spirit man was
being fed for the first time in my life
it was coming alive I was feeling so on
fire for God just listening to the word
of God for the first time I was feeling
energized I was the tiredness was going
away I was feeling energized I was
feeling so excited for God just hearing
an anointed message would make me just
so in love with Jesus and and and and so
focused on him after leaving church this
is the power of the anointing and so
when you can position yourself
in a church in ministries and like here
you are now where anointing is Flowing
your positioning yourself to constantly
be encountering God in power receiving
Miracles and having your spirit man be
fed come alive through the word that
carries power and this is why Paul says
my my message in preaching we're not
with wise and persuasive words
that's not what's needed
simple words are all that's needed but
simple words simple words of truth that
actually carry power that can bring
transformation and change anointed
teaching feeds your spirit man which
opens your spiritual eyes to grasp
things in the spiritual realm to really
comprehend it and get it and have this
excitement and Zeal to be spiritual to
follow the principles of the word of God
that's been illuminated by the anointing
released to you receive an anointed
teaching makes you want to run to the
word of God and when you read the word
of God it begins to come alive like
never before where before it might have
been boring or you didn't really feel
like reading it or you didn't understand
it we need the anointing for people to
actually encounter Jesus and also for
people's Spirits Spirit man to be fed
come alive and become more spiritual God
wants to release the this anointing to
you today for you to be a vessel of this
anointing lift your hands now to God as
he releases his anointing upon you may
you be filled now with God's power that
pierces hearts that brings
transformation to declare the sick to be
healed through you I declare demons to
recognize who you are in the spiritual
realm and to go at your command I
declare people to have real encounters
with Jesus Through you and as you talk
about Jesus that their Spirits would
come alive and they would become on fire
for Jesus I speak the fire of God to
fill you passion Zeal and if you've
never received the baptism of the Holy
Spirit God wants to release this to you
right now this gift is for every child
of God and this gift comes when you
surrender everything to Jesus
so right now close your eyes surrender
to Jesus surrender to surrender your
dreams your plan your will really give
him everything if you've been holding
back in some areas now is the time to
give God everything right now I release
