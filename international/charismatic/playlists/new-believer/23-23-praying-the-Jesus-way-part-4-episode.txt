I've been teaching a series called praying the Jesus way this is the fourth
week so if you haven't heard the past three weeks go to our YouTube page at fivefold church or my YouTube page under
live and you can catch up on all of them very important I'm teaching how to pray
in the new wine not the old wine way but the new wine way the Jes which is the
Jesus way amen and so I'm going to do a share a little summary a little summary
of last week where we left off I was teaching about uh how a servant of God
prays how how a servant of God when they are going to minister how they how they should pray
how they should pray the Jesus way the new wine way and simply how what this
should look like is having faith faith that God has sent you to do this work to
heal this aake to cast out demons you know he hasn't it's not like you just
put yourself there for Servants of God it's not like you just put yourself there and you're just wondering if God
will show up or not you're wondering if he will move you you feel maybe you
might have to entice him or do something extra to try to get him to come no you
see that's the old wine way when God has truly anointed a servant of God like
when he has called someone to be a five-fold minister for example he puts
his anointing in them his power in them for this job that he wants them to
accomplish so when he calls somebody he gives them what they need to do what he's calling them to do he gives them
the power the ability the the authority and the servant of God has to do their
part to obey you know to to study the word of God to
take time to hear the Holy Spirit speak Revelation um and and they have to do
their part to just keep showing up in obedience and doing all that God is asking them to do um whether it's
mundane things um like practical things not seemingly such spiritual things like
for me that was so much editing and posting and social media things um and
and and and as the servant of God keeps obeying whether it's those things or or spiritual seemingly more spiritual
things like showing up and preaching and ministering as a servant of God keeps doing those things again and
again it it's making the anointing to grow it's making the equipping to grow
it so it's not it's not a it's it's it's spiritual it's not a matter of like like me public speaking was my biggest fear
and weakness but it it wasn't like I had to cry out
God give me words give me words I don't know how I can do this it wasn't it also
wasn't like I needed to enroll in a public speaking class but it was more asking that lord I can't do this without
you I I have this weakness I need you but I trust that you will equip me you
will give me the ability to do this you'll give me the ability to speak so I will go now and Obey and
speak even though I don't feel adequate but I believe I choose to
believe so that that's the way of um accessing God's power and the giftings
and the the the abilities that's how it happened for me you know I didn't enroll in a public speaking class I didn't
enroll in seminary for me I received my um my my spiritual equipping Knowledge
from my spiritual Father which is biblical you you know this is how Timothy received from Paul this is how
the disciples received from Jesus this is how Elisha Elisha received from Elijah amen and it's it's in these days it's
very rare to find new wine Seminary school you know
so but things will change but for now you know hallelujah praise God yes
Hallelujah so so anyways like for me to access the the anointing Ing and the the
giftings the abilities this the the preaching giftings and everything it's come from that from the simple childlike
faith and obedience and as time went by God added
these things to me God added the abilities God increased the anointing he added the
giftings amen praise God so um so yeah
so it wasn't like me every day like Lord come please show up please show up bring
your power that's not that's not the new wine way that's not the spiritual way when God has really truly anointed someone he
has put the anointing there and now we can't control the level right like when
the way I speak now the way I preach now is not how I preached the first year or
the second year but I can't like manipulate and cry
out extra hard for God to give me you know the ability to speak how I
do now back then no I just had to be obedient I have faith I have what I need
for right now to do what God's calling me to do amen hallelujah and so I I was teaching
last week about how a servant of God should pray I mean like praying for as
they Minister and it's really simple just as I explained it's it can be just a simple prayer Lord I Thank you so much
for your favor for that you've given me everything I need to do it you've called me to do I thank you that your favor
surrounds me your anointing is here in me and I thank you Jesus that you are
going to do what you want to do today you are going to heal the sick you're going to free the oppressed so I thank
you Lord have your way that's that's how Servants of God
should pray it doesn't need to be more than that it doesn't need to be longer than that
really it is you know so um this kind of prayer
touches God's heart he he's touched when we have this kind of
faith and we live in this understanding of the spiritual realm rather than doing
religious things because maybe it makes us feel more spiritual or
something because of how people made us feel or what we what we learned or something amen and so that
being said I want to also now share that this servant of God prayer for Ministry
can apply to all of you when it comes to doing what God has asked you to
do whatever he's asked you to do whatever in life he's asked you to do
whether it's ministering to someone in your own spiritual domain spiritual T territory or just not ministering but
just doing things that he wants you to do that maybe you don't feel equipped to do that maybe feels difficult to do you
should pray in the same way I believe Lord You've equipped me
thank you for equipping me thank you for giving me the ability thank you for your spirit that guides me your holy spirit
thank you for your power your anointing thank you for the giftings and the abilities you've given me I can't do
this without you but I know I can do this with you I know you are with me and
so I I walk in faith now to do this thing thank you Jesus for helping
me thank you that I don't have to worry or struggle prayer is like this doesn't
have to be word for word I'm just giving you an example quite different than this like
crying out one wondering if he'll
hear worrying worrying did I pray long enough
for him to come it's quite different right this is the new wine way the Jesus
way of praying and this these are the prayers that please God we need to understand how important
faith is how much it pleases God for us to just walk in faith with everything we do
rather than be like a baby and forget his faithfulness and forget you know
choose not to Value what we've seen and learned about him that's what so many believers do as
they when they stay baby they've seen God show up they've seen God be faithful
they've seen God do Miracle upon Miracle but many don't value that like
many don't value that precious experience history of his
faithfulness and many don't understand this is God showing himself to you this is not um a random occurrence like an
outlier experience this is not a coincidence this is God showing himself
to you that this is who he is every day he is
faithful just because things don't happen in the timing we we don't we want them to doesn't mean God is Not
faithful if you're not seen yet it means he's faithful still it just isn't in his
timing and so God wants us to wake up to this truth value this truth remember
this truth walk in this truth so we so we don't go backwards anymore so we
don't say as a baby anymore you know be so
wishy-washy when blessings come and miracles manifest God is faithful and
then another day when you're not seeing a miracle you want yet I don't know
where God is pray for me Lauren where are
you God wants us to move forward from that baby place and the way we do that
is by choosing to be people of Faith choosing to walk by faith and not by
sight it's no secret things are not going to happen in the timing that we
want lots of times lot that's no secret
surprise if you didn't know but God is still faithful
don't let the enemy lie to you anymore let's please God every day by
having faith walking in faith amen
[Applause] hallelujah all right
so now I'm going to be teaching I'm teach I've been teaching
different aspects of prayer because there's many different kinds of prayer so the next as the next kind of prayer
I'm going to be teaching it how to pray is when you have desires of your heart
so with this I'm talking about I already taught first of all when
you have um the kind how you should pray when you need healing and
deliverance and [Music] um urgent Miracles I should say because
God does not want you to be bound by the devil anymore this is like 911 emergency if
you have demonic oppression like if you come here with demonic oppression and
you have faith God will deliver you now if you if you have lots of
layers it may be a process but you're not going to stay here with all of that demonic pression the it the Deliverance
will begin layers will begin to come off and it won't be that long it won't be that
long until you're fully delivered because because God sees this as an urgent matter he doesn't want you to be
bound by the devil anymore Hallelujah so deliverance and healing
these things are Urgent it's important to understand that God wants you to be
healed and delivered now you shouldn't come to the church with the attitude of I don't know if God will heal me or
Deliver Me Maybe it's not his timing we'll see no he wants you to understand
his amazing love you know that he sees it as it is when you are in a in demonic oppression it's as if you're in jail
you're stuck with the in the devil's jail you know and and Jesus loves you so
much he's come to destroy the works of the devil the Bible says and give you Abundant Life so this is his great love
that he wants to tear you out of that break the break the prison doors open
and pull you out of there now Hallelujah by his stripes you are healed this is
your inheritance from God this is the the blood that Jesus shed before he even
went on the cross was for you to have an inheritance of healing and freedom now
Hallelujah sometimes the full manifestation is an immediate but it be it begins in the spirit it be it began
in the spiritual realm right there you know like um this testimony from Korea
she when I prayed for her at when we were at the other building in Mission Road I think it was last year you know
she didn't feel like difference in her body yet the pain was still there at first but then she got on the plane and
all of a sudden the pain begins to leave she's sleeping now and then the pain left completely Hallelujah so the
miracle had begun in the spiritual realm It's just sometimes it it manifests
later in the physical but Jesus did it there and then brought freedom and healing
Hallelujah so that's why I'm saying I'm teaching you right now like there's a way to pray for um healing and
deliverance which I taught um I believe a couple Sundays ago um and yester uh
last Sunday as well where a big part of it is positioning yourself where God's power is to receive that anointing and
walk in faith believing that you've received that anointing rather than like
ignoring the fact that this power truly was released upon you and like crying to
God like thinking he didn't do anything no you need to believe that in this power of God the power of God that
you've that you've witnessed that you've seen that you've heard the testimon testimonies about you need to have this
faith that as I declare as I release this anointing God is moving now in power and
touching you every single one of you you need to have that Faith rather than just like waiting for something physical to
happen and if you didn't feel anything physical you think uh nothing happened and then you go and cry out to God heal
me God deliver me God when meanwhile God did heal you and deliver you but you
didn't open up the gift that he gave to you that had your name on it and you left the gift sitting here instead of
opening it receiving it valuing it cherishing it and keeping it and walking
out the door with it you know so that's one type of way to to pray which go back
and watch the other video to to to learn more the previous message to learn more about that but now I want to teach on
how to pray for um how to pray for desires of your heart that aren't
urgent like that that have to do with God's timing blessings he wants to give
you um and so here's an example of this like a spouse
children a house or maybe like if you're living in an in an apartment that you don't want
to be living in right now it doesn't feel like Abundant Life but it does get the job done but but you know God has more for
you so so that it's like there's things like that that that's part of abundant
life that God for sure like you can be confident in your heart that this is one of those desires that God will fulfill
as you Delight in him Delight in the Lord with all your heart and he will fulfill the desires of
your heart according to his will so there's certain things that you're going
to be sure of that are his will like if you're living in an apartment right now
sharing it with multiple people you know you you should know that God has more
for you in his timing
amen there's certain things you can be sure about that this desire of your heart is in alignment with God God's
will not just the healing and deliverance things but an example of that an example of like provision or
like having a car for example maybe you've just struggled financially for so so long you haven't even H maybe you
have a car but it's really not good it's beat up or something and you live in a place like La where you most PE it you
kind of need a car for the most part it's it's a lot more difficult without a car so you can you know even though this
isn't an urgent healing Deliverance matter you can have confidence that that desire of your heart to have a nice
functioning car is in God's will amen
there's certain things like that you can be like confident in and really believe
this is a promise from God and then there's going to be other desires of your heart that you might not be sure
maybe you have this great dream to have three children but you don't know for sure if that's God's will or not maybe
it's God's will for you to have two or four or one or zero you don't know you
know there's certain things like that that you just give to God and you say this is my desire Lord but have your way
I trust you this isn't like um you know make or break or something you know this
is just a desire in my heart but you know best CU we don't know best you know
my dream was to be a Christian Pop EDM singer songwriter I had searched for this dream for a long time like I was
trying to figure out what my calling was for a long time and finally I thought I found it
and I was really excited about it I really dreamed of this and you know what
it wasn't God's plan for my life it wasn't God's dream for my
life and as time has gone by that when I Surrender that because God called me to
he called me to be an apostle instead I'm so glad that God was in
control even though that was a good dream it was was a Christian singer you know that was my
dream but God had even better but he knew my heart better than I knew it
myself I thought that was going to bring me joy and sense of purpose and um like
really help a lot of people but God knew that could have been true but my true
calling is so much more I I'm so much more blessed to do what God has called
me to do to be an apostle I know I'm touching so many more people's lives God
is touching through me in this than than my dream that I had
you know so there's other things that you have to have that understanding you don't there's certain things that God
doesn't want you to figure out it's it's it's part of trusting him it's part of surrender it's part of this walk in
faith amen all right so I'm going to be I'm teaching right now how to pray for
desire desires of your heart like this and so
um so let's let's let's let's let's imagine it's like a house a home or
maybe an apartment a nicer apartment situation than what you live in now so let's say that that's the desire of your
heart and you you're confident that this is what God wants for you and so the the
the the proper way to pray for this is to make this request to God lord I
desire this I desire this house maybe it's a desire house with a backyard
things like this and you you pray this and then you just you leave it with God
you say and in your will in in your timing in your timing Lord this is my request but in your timing let your will
be done and when you make a request God
hears God hears it you don't have to yell it you can speak
in a normal voice even a whisper God even knows your mind before you think
things you know he can hear you when you ask and so you need to understand that
God loves you so much God wants you to have Abundant Life God wants this for
you that you have requested and he's going to do it he has
all the power in the world the greatest power to accomplish this to make this happen to open up the doors so he has a
kingdom he has a kingdom government he has angels He has he has this this
spiritual realm Kingdom that's unseen that goes to work and does things
that he needs to be done working with us helping us too you
know and so for request like this like if it's like a home okay you request this and the request is is placed in
like the file in the spiritual realm and now God sends his kingdom
government to accomplish this and so now things start to move
forward in the spiritual realm I'm I'm giving you some spiritual meaty truths today
Hallelujah and so the God sends the kingdom of government to look for this
home for example knowing what you like even when I learned this truth my heart
was so touched because where I currently live where I currently live it's a it's
an apartment and there are two fireplaces in this apartment and when I
when my spiritual father actually revealed this truth that I'm sharing with you right now these these mey truth
um but when I learned this truth I was so touched because I love fireplaces and
I never had one like growing up but I love them and I didn't even ask God for
a um a fireplace I didn't even imagine that
could happen now I thought maybe like later on in my life I mean because I
wasn't looking for anything extravagant just something in in this apartment that I have now I've been in since 2021 the
year that Revival broke out um but I wasn't looking for something extravagant or big just something that was in a nice
neighborhood cuz where I was currently there was a lot of break-ins and it wasn't that safe and um just something
with a little more space and something a little nicer that's what I was looking for so I wasn't even like thinking about
a fireplace let alone too I was just looking for like a basic apartment I was
that's going to be happy with but but it says um
um now Ephesians 3:20 now to him who is able to carry out his purpose and do
super abundantly more than all that we dare ask or think infinitely beyond our
greatest prayers hopes or dreams according to his power that is at work
within us according to his power that is at work within us according to our faith
the power of our faith
amen yeah and so like there was only like a couple apartments when I was looking that would
even kind of work like in the price range and in the area and everything I just saw like two that I could even look
at and the last time I looked for apartments in La it was like a nightmare you know it was like applying for a job
I got rejected from so many
um y'all understand huh and even the ones that I was didn't
that I didn't get that I applied for they weren't they weren't nice they weren't as nice as the one that I was currently at this was many years ago
like back in back in like 20 um 17 is yeah um so I was like this is going to
probably be really hard cuz God was speaking go find another apartment in 2021 and I'm like this is going to
probably be really hard and the first and only apartment I went in was in a nicer neighborhood than I could ever
imagine to live in and um was beautiful and wasn't that expensive and I just
went and looked at it and I just got it like the it was like a condo owner the condo owner like just like was like yeah
like like the next day I could just it was super I knew it was Supernatural cuz it wasn't the case years
before and um and I had two
fireplaces in my room and in the living room which when it's cool weather
because I don't want to be wasting you know electricity too much but when it's cool weather I I got that fireplace on
every night you better believe it Hallelujah but
um look but there's something I want to teach you through this is that when you
make that request the king God sends the kingdom government to go look for what you like and what would be a good area
like better than what we could know and and but but they all but but
God sending his kingdom government the the kingdom government is also looking at
timing the timing like oh he or she is
too busy in this season the timing is not right let's wait a few months or a year or two
years that's what God is thinking and then sends the kingdom government to go
accomplish and so like one time one time one time when I was looking for apartments and it was it was difficult
actually I looked for apartment another time and I just gave up because it wasn't God's timing but sometimes he wants us to knock on the door like it's
not like like he wants us to go search even if it's not his timing so we can
see what's out there so we can know what to look for so we can have experience know what to pray for know what to ask
for amen and so um it was evident how easily
it happened and how it was beyond whatever I could dream or pray for this was God's timing that's why it happen so
quickly and easily and it was in the midst of when I started traveling every single week to minister and it was just
so easy it happened Hallelujah so so when you are praying
for things requests for God that are desires of your heart it's important that you allow
God's timing to Prevail you know like it's important
that you rest and you let God do it in his timing you don't be stubborn I want
this and I want this now and then you keep on praying like Lord open the doors
now open the doors now you you really need to surrender to God's timing that's
what he wants and we can't change it we can't manipulate it so this is the W
wise way to pray is to make that request know that the that it's been put in a
file and it's now starting to be worked on in the spiritual realm and it's going to be what you are
asking and more more because God does exceedingly abundantly beyond what we could dare ass
think dream or imagine Hallelujah and God's timing is
best so it will happen but it's going to happen in God's timing not yours God's
timing but that's going to be the best timing Hallelujah so often many times when
there's requests that you have like this and it's not happening many times people think they need to um add more things
add on fasting they need to I guess God didn't hear me he probably didn't need to hear me maybe I need to do more things to get his attention you don't
need to get his attention he heard the prayer request it's already being worked on rest it's just about God's timing
now amen and so it pleases God if we can live in this Revelation instead of
wondering doesn't God like see all that I'm doing for him doesn't he think like
I deserve and nicer place to live a
spouse you know we can you know we can be thinking
like this and we can be saying Lord am I not doing enough and wasting time and
being like a baby meanwhile it's been months or even years
maybe that the kingdom government has been working on this prayer
request and the door is going to open it may be opening up soon soon but
Meanwhile we're being silly and not pleasing to God don't know if he heard
me you know God wants to reward you he is a
rewarder of those who seek Him diligently and serve him
so first of all all that I just taught is what I I want you to know this is not for every believer
this is for believers who are surrendered obedient serving
God yes so but God wants you to know God wants you to have this faith
that because I'm serving God because I'm obedient because I'm surrendered he will
reward me he wants to reward me he loves me so much and so this is a principle
you take care of God's business and he Tak takes care of yours he will take care he wants you to
live in this this faith if you're seeing all these other people that are having
living a what looks like a blessed life maybe like in the area of financially or something and you're seeing all these
people that aren't serving God you think it's hard for God to bless you the way they have these
things God God lets makes it to rain on the those who who on the just and the
unjust right I mean you need to have this
confidence of who you are in Christ and how much God wants to reward you and
bless you it's just about his timing all right and so he wants to it's
like it's like me with my apartment I was like I I'll be fine with just this like something basic but in God's timing
God gave me so much more like and so that you need to think of that like yes
it's taking longer but God has abundantly more than you're even wanting coming just wait a little bit because
he's doing something in this waiting oh he's building something precious in your heart he's building your he's growing
your patience and your trust in him and your humility you know that you're choosing to obey him without complaining
you know you you you you don't have have a lot of things that you want yet and you're tirelessly serving him but you're
humble you're like I don't need anything but Jesus I'm not entitled to
anything you choose to Li you choose to believe this you choose to only speak
words like this rather than complaining he's building humility in you so and
he's making it so when he blesses you you value it so much you the the the longer the wait the
more you're going to Value it and so God's even wanting you to be blessed daily more by this thing rather
than being entitled to it and not appreciating what you have he's so good just trust him
amen
hallelujah so now I want to teach on this another aspect of prayer which
is praying for Revival praying
for the ministry you're you're a part of you know so these prayers are not I've
been teaching mostly like personal need prayers now we're I'm teaching this kind
of prayer so I I I shared um recently in
this series that um it is old wine to
think that if we all cry out maybe then God will decide to show
up in power but God wants to move in power and
heal his people and deliver his people more than you do so we don't have to convince him by crying out you know but
but he has his ways which I explained which he anoints a servant people pray for Revival people pray you know people
pray for Revival like um Matthew 9:38 so pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send
out workers into his Harvest this is saying pray in alignment with God's ways
don't just pray for Revival pray for God to raise up servant of God a servant of God to like Moses a servant of God who
can be like Apostle Peter Apostle Paul pray that God would anoint someone with a pure humble heart who would who would
carry the power of God and be a leader in the body of Christ to help equip
other believers amen so um so this is God's way he he
anoints he he hears prayers this is like you know my my spiritual father Prophet Jordi he prophesied that God has heard
America's prayers for Revival and he has answered them he has brought Revival now and God is pouring out Apostles and
Prophets he's he's raising up these Servants of God these Apostles and Prophets putting the anointing in them
and moving through them to spearhead this revival to lead this
revival so once an anointed servant of God is there like in the church we don't need
to like oh Lord please heal people today please deliver people today please show up today Lord like we don't have to do
that he's going to come in power when he is when the when there's an anointed servant of God present what we what you
need to focus on is Faith is is rejecting the lies of the devil and coming with expectancy
and Faith to receive coming with faith I know your power is here Lord and I'm ready to receive
it rather than show up please God please touch
me you know void of Faith prayers right so um as we we learned this now
I'm going to teach about how the proper way to pray um like okay so first of all
let's say that there is a church that um is like a is not experiencing the power
of God and so as they're praying for Revival they they can pray for Revival
and ask God for Revival but the proper way to pray is to ask God to send workers out in the Harvest so so the proper way to pray is to ask God to to
raise up an anointed servant of God to come deliver them to move through the servant of God to deliver them you know
and and if if if if if people could pray this prayer then God would open up their eyes to see where he has already
released Servants of God and they'd be able to receive them rather than like
ignoring God's ways ignoring that scripture that says pray that God would send out workers in the Harvest and
instead being like God show up from the sky right now and heal me like singular
minded prayers it's not going to help your eyes to open up to see where God is moving in power and how he can heal and
deliver you now amen so I'm just teaching this doesn't really apply to like you all because
we're are a church that's alive amen with the anointing but I'm teaching you like how God wants his the Believers
that aren't experiencing Revival how they should be praying so then they can be ready they can be prepared in their
hearts to recognize when God has answered the prayer risen up a servant of God with
who anointed amen hallelujah and so so now I want to
share for you how you pray how you should pray for this revival to grow how
you should pray for each Sunday service how you should pray for flourish
conferences for Revival is now events so when you pray your prayers are
preparing the field in the spiritual
realm it says um 2 Chronicles 7:14 then if my people
who were called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways I will hear
from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land so if they will humble themselves
pray seek my face and turn from the Wicked Ways I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sins and restore their land so when it says restore their
land this is speaking about the field in the spiritual realm
so when this is the power of your prayers When you pray for a church
service Revival to grow Revival Services conferences When you pray like when you
are praying may may more eyes open up may more people come May nothing keep people
from coming and receiving when people come may they receive all that you have for them um
like if you this is first of all this is how you should pray and when you pray like this you your your prayers are powerful
to help the people to receive it's like you you yourself are a
seed that can be reproduced like you are a seed like I My
Eyes Are Open up and I am receiving this anointing I receiving this revival I have received healing and deliverance I
want what God than in me to be replicated duplicated increase so you
know you're praying for other believers to receive so as you have this heart for
them and pray for them in the spiritual realm it is helping them it is O helping
their eyes to open up it's helping their heart to be able to receive it's preparing the
fields to be able to receive amen so you know so it's not like it's
not like Lord it what I mean is it shouldn't be like Lord put make sure
that you move through your servant show up through your servant God
no pour more anointing to your servant God do Miracles God no God's already
going to do that you know be with what I've been sharing through this message
that's why I Shar this because when God anoints a servant of God God moves through that servant of God without us
having to pray show up God the anointing is there amen so the prayers that we should
that you should pray that are prayers that prepare the field that prepare people to
receive prepare the hearts amen and this is also how you can help
your own self receive more is by praying you know instead of praying like show up
through Apostle Katherine today Lord you know um please heal and deliver your
people today instead of that you you pray Lord I don't want to I don't want
to be distracted from anything I want you to have your way I believe that you're going to show
up I believe that you're going to bring healing and freedom there's Miracles I need in my life and I believe I will
receive them when I come come I come with humility Lord I come
with childlike Faith have your way I don't want to miss anything that
you have for me so you pray in this way that prepares your your heart the field of your
heart amen hallelujah praise God so you see we
don't need to be striving for the anointing and power of God to come and miracles to take
place what we need to focus on is making sure our hearts are ready and praying
for others for their eyes to open to be able to receive what God is for sure going to
release amen hallelujah and um you can pray also you
should be praying for others to come to come and receive Lord bring more people
bring more people to the church you should be praying those prayers but there's there's sometimes in
pray with these prayers also like the prayer of provision like when you need
provision there's prayers like needing provision for yourself or praying for people to come to the church where you
need to take action not just pray you need to knock on the
door like the example I gave for provision um you you you you you should
say I re you should pray I receive that declaration over my finances over doors
to open up for a job for example that was released at my church like through Apostle cath for example if for you all
here I receive that and I believe that I believe that that anointing has touched
my life and that doors will open up in the spiritual realm and the favor is upon me it has been released to me thank
you Lord that's how you pray rather than Lord open the door it has been released
to you on Sunday or Wednesday and the live stream or the flourish conference
um but then you also need to knock on the door you need to look for a job someone's not going to just call you
out to the blue saying I'd like to give you a job that's not going to happen you got to knock on the door seek ask knock and the door will be
open to you you shall find
Hallelujah um and so this is the same principle for praying for people to come to
church you need to ask them invite them pray and then reach out and share on
your social media hallelujah praise
God thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah
hallelujah and now I'm going to go over right now um um how
to I'm going to teach how to um pray for
your children those of you that have children or those of you that have family members who don't believe in
Jesus or aren't receiving Jesus in his fullness at least um and so I've taught I've I've
done many teachings about how to walk in authority God has given us Dominion to walk in authority
um and so but I want to teach you really how to pray
prayers o for your children that are spiritual so when it comes to your children your own children this is an
area that this is your spiritual dominion and so if your children but
your if your children are coming to the same church you are um there's times
where you can God can lead you to walk in that Authority and command a demon to
go and command things over your CH children but the the big way that that
God wants you to pray spiritually is to have this understanding that
as as your children are with you they're with you in the home as you're watching they're with you here in the church that
anointing is coming upon them that is released so it's not like you know for
example if I'm praying for everyone here it's not like I'm only praying for adults and then you adults need to now
go pray for your children cuz I didn't pray for I didn't release anointing to them no this
anointing is coming upon everybody who's here amen the Declarations the commands in
the spiritual realm Hallelujah and so the spiritual way to pray for the
children is um like like after Sunday maybe you're seeing the child is having
an issue in some in some area maybe sickness um this anointing that has been
released upon my life that has been released upon my child that this past
Sunday those words that were declared it must happen in my child that healing
that was released it must take place it must manifest in my child because I have done things
according to God's ways I have positioned myself my my
child where the anointing is being released and that anointing Came Upon My
Child it didn't go past my child that anointing came on my
child and so these miracles must take place the healing must take
place you know God wants to see you have this faith in his power in his ways and
trust him amen and the ways to pray for family
members that um don't know Jesus or are not interested in the god of Jesus
coming in power in this revival the way to pray is to pray like
um this anointing that I am receiving may it be released to my
child may it be extended to my child or not not child family member to my family
member or we can be talking about adult children to my adult
child may this anointing be released to them may this anointing touch them that
I have received this power of God that's flowing upon my life may it touch them
may it work in their life may God's power work in their life touch their life may their eyes open up may healing
take place May freedom take place you know that's the spiritual way
to pray with that faith and understanding of how Mighty the anointing is that you
are receiving that is truly coming upon your life and it's like you're understanding The Source rather than
like neglecting and forgetting the source like the power of
God that's being released upon your life so God doesn't want you to forget that and just go in a religious way when it
comes to your family member you know and pray religious prayers when it comes to your family
member this power of God is so mighty and God loves all that all that you care about he loves and these are his
children he loves them more than you love them take care of God's business and he will take care of your business
and so your the business of your heart your heart is grieving for these family members God cares about what you care
about and so your your obedience is powerful what you are doing to to
receive the anointing is so powerful to touch your family members and friends
too Hallelujah and let me tell you a spiritual truth that's so powerful that
God revealed to me um you know you can rest as you pray
that you can rest and know that God is working and it's timing people have free
will so it's not going to it might not be like the next day sometimes that you'll see
change but he's working he is working and um he's so he's so amazing
like he knows what to do he he knows what to do like maybe maybe a family member of yours is so resistant to the
power of God moving and casting out demons maybe they're resistant to a woman preacher
Pastor so maybe they're maybe they believe in God but they're not that serious about God but they're really
resistant to your pastor your Apostle and what you believe in the
power of God the resistant well God knows how to move how
to slowly bring them into his fullness in their timing and you know
without going against their will like he can as you pray this he can send
somebody who is a Believer but they're not maybe a part of your church part of
this church and maybe they maybe they don't even know that much about Revival and everything but this person is set on
fire for Jesus and this person has experienced transformation in Jesus they experienced freedom and and God sends
this person to to speak to they they they meet somewhere they meet your
family member or something and God uses this random person you don't even know
who's just a believer in the world and they're able to receive through this
person and all of a sudden a lot of seeds are planted and they start to change and as time goes by God pulls
them more and more and they're more open to receiving more of the fullness of
Jesus so God God is so amazing he's working behind the
scenes this anointing is powerful you need to trust in his power to touch your family members and your
friends rest in his timing and rest in his perfect ways amen
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so now I have gone
oh I have gone through um I have gone
through oh so wait I want to clarify one more thing though
um one other way of praying is walking in authority and Dominion when it is your spiritual territory and God's
timing so that's going to look like when and I shared this you know recently like
last Sunday I think um it's going to look like you know someone in your workplace or someone you meet they start
opening up to you and they need freedom and you start sharing their test your testimony for example and God leads and
and God leads you because they're opened because we don't force people we don't beat the Bible over people's heads amen
because the kindness of God leads to repentance and God is gentle and we got to be like God to be
attractive and go in his timing to plan seeds and not plant seed and do a harvest all at one time just CU we want
to amen and so so sometimes you you you'll follow the lead of the Holy
Spirit someone opens up that you share your testimony they're like I want that freedom so God leads you to command a
demon to go out of them so that's a time where you know you actually use your own
authority I command this demon to go rather than saying this prayer like this anointing that I'm receiving may this be
now released to you like that that would be a time when you you don't do that you walk in your own
authority Hallelujah you walk in your own authority this demon must
go but a lot of most of the time the prayers you see you are like calling
upon that you know you you're you're recognizing you don't need to make these these de these different
declarations you just remember what you have
received and you thank God for it and you rest in his timing of the when it manifests
fully that's the bulk of the prayers
amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
thank you
Jesus thank you Lord so so far when I have been teaching now about
prayers over this series different kinds of prayers I've been teaching about how to pray for requests when you have a
need for miracles I've been teaching how to request um the desires of your
heart I've I've taught that's what I taught today and I've taught about how
Servants of God how they pray and and now I've taught how how to
pray as you walk in your Authority in your own spiritual Dominion spiritual
territory amen so these are the different types of
prayers that I have been teaching amen and the last type of prayer that I'm
going to just briefly I have longer teachings on this but just I just want to just so you can have this full overview of Prayer in this series The
Last kind of prayer is communion with God prayers and this is your this is
intimacy and friendship with God so this is not like
requests this is communication intimacy and so much of this is going to
be just remembering that God is with you always and inviting him to be with you
in every moment you know being aware he's here and including
him everywhere in your mind in your heart and sometimes in your
words I say sometimes because many times you'll be with people you'll be in a public space but you can still be having
intimacy with God it shouldn't be just reserved to
like in your room that you have this type of prayer communion with God it should be everywhere all the time Holy
Spirit never leaves you amen hallelujah and so a lot of your prayer
communion with God your prayer time communion with God is going to be
gratitude Hallelujah so a lot of your prayer time uh your your communion is is
intimacy is going to be just gratitude so this is why this is what this is why I really God really wanted you to have
this series to to learn about prayer because so many times people are
thinking I'm I don't know how to pray and I don't think I'm praying enough because I'm running out of things to say
but I what I what I hope you've learned throughout this series is that you shouldn't have tons of
words you shouldn't have millions of requests because he hears you that one
time when you say it and now after that you thank him and you remember oh God's
working on it he sent his kingdom government to work on it I'm excited wow God is so good how he loves
me how he heard my request and he's working on it amen so
imagine how can you be requesting for things like every day like millions of things every
day I can't even imagine to think of all of that what that would look
like right and so um God wants you to get out
of this place of thinking that prayer is about performance ritual um the amount of words you say
how passionate the words are you know he wants you to get out of that and
know that it's about walking with him walking in intimacy with him which looks like walking in
faith walking in faith not walking in religion and rituals but walking in
faith walking in gratitude so most of my communion
prayers with God like communion intimacy are thinking God there's not much more
to say I've asked for what I need and I know that he's taking care of
everything amen it says in um it says in Matthew
6:25 this is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life whether you have had enough food or drink or enough clothes to wear isn't life more than food and
your body more than clothing look at the birds they don't plant or harvest or store food in barns for your heavenly father feeds them and aren't you more
valuable to him than they are can all your worries add a single moment to your life can all your your your your your
worry filled prayer at a single moment to your life and why worry about your clothing
look at the lies of the field and how they grow they don't work or make their clothing yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they
are and if God cares so wonderfully for wild flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow he will
certainly care for you why do you have so little faith so don't worry about these things
saying what will we eat what will we drink what will we wear these things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers but
your heavenly father already knows all your needs seek the kingdom of God above
all else and live righteously and he will give you everything you need so seek the kingdom of God be
serious about the work of God contributing to the work of God sewing into the work of God being equipped to
be a better Warrior of God in his Revival Army be focused on being
equipped on on receiving the teachings that's seeking first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness means the character of Christ the fruits of the spirit um humility selflessness
self-control patience um Peace
generosity amen having faith childlike Faith that's
the righteousness so seek this and all these things will be added to you so that scripture shows us that praying
long religious prayers and requesting for them over and over and over again is not what releases to you the things that
you need and the desires of your heart it's seeking first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness and understanding that God knows what you need before you even ask for it if you're taking care of
God's business God will take care of yours surely if you are are contributing to
God's work the kingdom government sees it as its own
God sees this is my servant I must give him or her all that he or she needs and also reward them and show my favors upon
their life in every way from spiritual to physical so that they may be more attractive spiritually to everyone in
the world so more people may want to follow Jesus because they see how I've blessed
them in every area of Life
hallelujah hallelujah praise prise God praise God
so no more wasting time with religion it's time to to get busy with
our hands and do the work of God and and knock on the door seeking first the kingdom of God
giving everything to Jesus giving everything he's put in our hands the seeds the the the finances the abilities
he's given us the time he's given us and seek first the kingdom of God by
contributing to his work amen
hallelujah no more time wasting time no no time to waste time
anymore it's time to live spiritually live by faith in a way
that's pleasing to God so we can be effective for the kingdom of God Amen
Hallelujah
