Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Enough. Enough. Enough. Your time is up.
I break every word curse, every generational curse, and I declare every
spirit of witchcraft, every condundalini spirit, every spirit coming from new
age, every spirit that's tormented her mind and brought confusion. I declare on
three, all must go from her in Jesus' name. One,
two, three. Thank you, Jesus.
Hallelujah. You are free. You are free.
The physical torment, as bad as it was, was like child's play compared to the
mental torment. I don't know if everyone realizes like how heinous like mental torment can really get. The closest
thing that I could describe it is like a living nightmare hell. every single day. I didn't even know it was like
physically possible for a human being to suffer this bad. Went back to Colorado
to to try to get medical treatment. That was when everything just snowballed and got worse and worse. I was suffering worse and worse from mental illness. It
came down really bad with complex PTSD. I did have bipolar disease, severe
anxiety and panic disorder, several other diagnoses, BPD. I would tremor like shake like this all the time. parts
of my like neural pathways had like died me even just being in the atmosphere at
Flourish LA. Jesus is here. Like it was supernatural. Like my spirit like knew this thing takes over my body and starts
like shrieking like no. It was crazy like how much this thing just like hated
you, hated Jesus, hated his anointing. That weekend I was delivered from
curses, kundalini spirit, witchcraft, spirits that came from a new age. And I was healed from seizures. I went from
the closest thing to hell that I can imagine to the closest thing to heaven that I didn't even think like was
possible on this earth like at Flourish. Welcome to the Revival is now podcast. I
cannot wait for what God is going to do through the screen today. I believe today I know today he's going to move in
power. He's going to speak to you. Your spiritual eyes will open up. Your faith will increase. And you will receive
miracles. Hallelujah. I am so excited and blessed to have a guest with me here
today, Autumn from Colorado. Yes. Is that right? Yes. Hi.
Welcome. Autumn is planted at Fifold Church and she has such an amazing testimony of deliverance, healing,
transformation, and I've been so amazed to see the power of God come upon her life, demons be
cast out of her, and see her come from death to life. Such transformation. And
so, I know you'll be blessed by her story today, Autumn. Thank you for for sharing your story.
Of course. Yeah. When did you come to 5F and how did you come? Well, when I had found by the time
I found 5F, someone had told me about it. Somebody who was like uh naturopath
that I was seeing at the time and by that time um I was extremely extremely
ill like like very very sick like I had extreme mental illness and it I was starting to snowball into extreme
physical illness. Um I did not really have uh a lot of like options left. Um,
it was not looking hopeful. It was not it it just was not going to end well. Um, and somebody just mentioned, do you
have you heard of Apostle Katherine Craig? And I was having uh dementia
symptoms back then like periodically and like I had I remember I had friends that I was like tight with and I never
remembered that they ever existed. I found out later like when God healed my memory but at that time like um I didn't
even remember they existed yet I remembered your name and that was odd like that like that was weird like like
that was not something that normally would happen and and like I kept thinking about I was like Kathern C like I never heard that name before and it
was 2K's and I just I don't know I just I looked you up and um it was it was
pretty obvious like like yeah God was moving in power at 5F And um that was
that was how I found that was how I found 5. And when was that? That was in
2020 three. That was in October November.
October November of of 2023, right? Yeah. And so you mentioned that you were in a
lot of bondage. Yeah. At that time. So can you share what that bondage looked like and sickness?
Yeah. I grew up in a very traumatic home. Um, like a lot of abuse and like a
lot of really bad stuff. Um, I was Christian, but I was like lukewarm. Like
I grew up in a lot of confusion. Like I I had a I had influence of religious
Christianity and lukewarm Christianity, but also like witchcraft and um what is
agnostic? Agnosticism. I don't know that's the right term, but agnosticism.
Um and um an influence trying to convince me that Jesus wasn't real and then
another influence trying to tell me that he was. Somehow through all that like mess of like just terrible like trauma
and abuse like I did hold on to like no Jesus is real.
I don't really know how how I I really believe it was by the grace of God. I really believe that like he he stepped
in and like did something.
Um
yeah and and through that I really started seeing um how dangerous like the spirit of
religion is because that really started I knew that Jesus loved me but when
there's so much religion in church it turned me away from churches
um and but even if I was in churches there were times where I tried to go to churches Um,
it wasn't the power of God. It they I didn't even know what the anointing was. Like I had heard I think I'd heard that
word before, but I was like, "Oh, you know, whatever. I don't really know what that is." It's like one of those words from the Bible. I was afraid of the
Bible. I didn't want to read the Bible because I was told things that like God didn't really like women that much. Um I
saw um like racism in the church and that was something that really like
deeprooted like I hated so much and um things were just it was just rough. Like
it just seemed like there was nowhere to go like like any anytime like I did like try out a church it was like
it was like there was some of Jesus there but I I could tell it wasn't all
Jesus. Like it wasn't completely Jesus. like it was tainted. There was something wrong. And I I couldn't put my finger on
it because I was not biblically educated at all. I was afraid of the Bible cuz I didn't want people I didn't want to um
like quote find out that what people were saying was true, like that God didn't like women or something like
that. Um so I stayed away from it to try to hold on desperately to like Jesus loves
me. Like I I know that because it says that and and the rest of the Bible, I don't have an answer for you. I'm not a
theologist, but like I know that's true. And so like I tried to hold on to that.
Um so I did get a lot of bondage from from religious confusion, trauma, really
bad like abuse growing up, stuff, things like that. And and um I also did have
witchcraft in my family. I did have generational curses. I did have like
full-blown Satanist in my family, too. Like like it it was just kind of a lot of that. and um started I kind of was
always I remember Ashley saying this and and I really like uh resonated with this. I was kind of always like a sick
kid. Like I remember my mom saying that to me. She was like she was like you were just a sickly kid. Like like I was
always like kind of skinny and really really like pale and like really really
just I was sick all the time. And and I could tell from a young age that I had mental illness. Like I never I didn't
figure out that I had horrible anxiety and depression and things like that till I was old enough to even understand what
that was. Like when you have never experienced something different, that's all you know. And so you don't even know
that there's something wrong. And um I I I remember being 13. I felt like I was
breathing through water. Like I I I felt like I couldn't breathe. And I didn't know do I have asthma? Like what is
going on? And I was having panic attacks and and this thing would happen. I would end up on the ground having like
full-blown panic attacks where I was like hyperventilating. Felt like I was having a heart attack at 13 years old.
And then I started having insomnia. Like one time that started at 14. One time I
didn't sleep for 4 days once and I was in high school. Wow. Yeah. And so it was like it was just
really rough and and just so a lot of that came from trauma and abuse. So I
started getting this bondage from all those different things and um So you went so you went through trauma
and abuse and then you started finding all of these things start happening in your life after that. Yeah. Yeah. And and I didn't I wasn't
allowed to see um I wasn't allowed to get help as a kid. Uh and so the one
thing that I did have was I was introduced to alcohol at 11 years old. So I like started drinking at like 11.
And so all I knew is I was 11 years old and that made me not feel pain as much
when I would drink it. And so um I did start getting addicted to alcohol at
that that age and and just whenever I could get it like I would drink I got
alcohol poisoning once when I was by the time I was 14.
Wow. I remember going to sleep thinking, I can't I can't I can't go to the
hospital cuz I don't want anyone to get in trouble because where I got the alcohol from, but I don't know if I'm
going to wake up. Wow. And I didn't care. I didn't want to.
Like, I really didn't want to. And this whole time, like my question was like,
where is God? Like, where is God? And and there was so much that the church wasn't addressing. Like because I I went
through like we went to church on holidays. Like we were that we did that.
Like we did and and I heard about things that people were preaching and things, but nobody was addressing any of this.
Like nobody was it just seemed like all these things are laid out in the
Bible, but why does it seem like they weren't true? But it's not that they
weren't true. It it's that when you're missing the power of God, like when when you're missing the anointing and you're
you don't know what God's will is and so and you don't have a spiritual leader to guide you in God's will, like you you
don't have any of that. And when you're just preaching this message that is empty and has no power of God that is um
religious, which is I mean I got delivered of condemnation, a spirit of
condemnation. I got demons from that. Like like it's it's
it hasn't been helping anybody. It didn't help me. And I fully believe that if if there was an anointed church
around when I was growing up, most if not most if maybe even not all
of the stuff that happened to me would not have happened. Yes. Like it it a lot of that stuff I would
ask sometimes ask Christians like who are in lukewarm religious churches, why is this happening? cuz I had like an
abnormally bad life. Like I had like that reputation of like I don't know that would only happen to Autumn. Like
and and I didn't know about demonic oppression. I didn't know about generational curses.
That's definitely I believe part of what that was from because someone else in my family had the exact same thing. Like
they were known for horrible weird stuff happening to them all the time to the
point where they were known for it. You didn't hear about that stuff in church. I never even heard a church like
talk about demons, but I heard family like who was involved
in witchcraft talk about demons. So why are we like why why are they talking about it and we're like you know the the
church was pretending like it wasn't real. Yeah. It it just it snowballed and
snowballed and I didn't have help but I knew Jesus loved me and it was weird. It
was just this weird like uh conundrum just snowball and I just got more and
more confused. I did start I remember um the picture of you really
like so frail. Yeah. And that was like pretty recent before
you first received freedom when you came to 5F Church. Was it? Yeah. That Yeah, it was. That was in
2023. That what why was that? Why were you so frail? What was it? Sickness.
Yeah, that wasn't even as bad as it like was like I was like probably probably a
little bit better at that point, which is wild. But basically what had happened
was I um I uh I was suffering worse and worse
from mental illness because of things that had happened to me. Like I came down really bad with PTSD. It was
actually complex PTSD was what it was officially diagnosed as. I did have bipolar disease. I did have um severe
anxiety and panic disorder. Um several other several other diagnoses.
BPD, but you really couldn't you couldn't tell for the longest time. What's BPD?
Uh borderline personality. Okay. Yeah. It's it's something that comes from
like being invalidated a lot as a kid. like that was how was it diagnosed in me and it would just cause me to just be
really impulsive. Um and
yeah, I it's it I started started coming down really really bad with like mental
illness from the stuff that had happened and I was covering it up with like drugs and alcohol and um
socializing honestly was like one of my biggest uh like coping mechanisms. I just would make everybody laugh and I
was always laughing and I was covering up like all this like horrible pain. And so that was the only way I knew how to
deal with it. And I um started coming down with with it worse and worse and
worse. And with that I I have reason to believe
that that that because your your mental and your physical are connected. You
know, it's cells. They're all cells. And I do have reason to believe that that is
what maybe triggered some or a lot of the physical illness.
Um, it did and it's all spiritual. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's not just sickness as a
repercussion of the mental problems, but it's infirmity. It's all just works of the devil.
Yeah. Yeah. And I did just start coming down with like physical sickness and um
the list is very long, but basically I was having like problems with my organs like was like the the main physical
concern. And I was It was a lot of your organs, right? It was like almost all of them. Yeah. Like they were just having problems.
Yeah. Like they weren't functioning right out of nowhere kind of like your organs were fine until
Yeah. And it it like it wasn't all at once. It started off with like a couple
of things and then it just started snowballing like really really quickly and it was so quick and like they were
getting so severe that like they how how were they even supposed to keep up with
like trying to diagnose and figure out like is this a symptom from like a medication or is this like a new thing
that you're coming down with or like or whatever. And I also resonated with what
Ashley said where she was like, I didn't know if I was going to die from I think she said from the health issues or from
a side effect from a medication. There was one night where I uh I wasn't sure if I needed to call an ambulance because
I like almost had a heart attack from something that they put me on that um
the doctor didn't realize I had a heart problem. And so he put me on it and I
I uh almost had a heart attack. So it's like it was a mess. And then the
the main concern was if I don't die from that, I was going to die from suicide.
Like honestly, like I had really horrible
physical torment. And like I'm telling you, like the physical torment, as bad
as it was, was like child's play compared to the mental torment.
Like I remember a time when the mental torment was a little bit less, but I was
way more physically sick. And I was totally cool with that. I was like, "God, if you just want me to be
physically like physically disabled forever, I would trade the mental torment for the being physically
disabled." Because I was like, I would have traded that all day. Like, it was I
don't know if everyone realizes like how heinous like mental torment can really
get. Um, the closest thing that I could describe it is like I felt like I I felt
People say like, "Oh, it was it was like hell. It was like hell." No, I I really like I don't know how else to describe
it. It was like a living nightmare hell every single day that I remember sitting
there one day in bed and just observing like myself cuz I've
always been like I don't know I like science and and and studying things and I literally like was looking at myself
like kind of abstract and was thinking like this is crazy because I didn't even
know it was like physically possible. I didn't even know it was possible for a human being to suffer this bad. Like
this is actually wild. And I had suffered my whole life. Like that was all I really experienced was like
suffering. And it shocked me like to see that that was
even possible to suffer that much. Um, and that really that was saying a lot.
Like friends who were close to me who did know like that I was that I was suffering inside the whole time like
that they were shocked by it. Like it it was it was just like
it was horrible. It was just absolutely horrible. And um at the worst time at
the worst of it by that time I had cut off all my friends. So even before then
they were saying like the enemy's influence on your life and so this was one reason why I had a hard
time testifying when I started getting really sick and like you could see it and you and I was a different person
like I wasn't all laughing and funny anymore and chill and cool like I was
getting I was just getting resentful and like mean towards people and like I didn't want to be but I just was just
mad at everyone and like the world and um and you could just tell that I was
going away. And at that point, I was like, I'm going to die and I don't want people to be upset by that because I
knew it was going to probably be like a slow process. Um,
I'm sorry if you're watching this and like I know you personally because I did disappear at one point because I just
didn't want it to like affect people bad like to watch that happen. Like it
scared me enough to like watch it happen and I didn't want that affecting other
people. And I had like a ton of friends. Like I had so many friends and like so many acquaintances. And I also like I
just didn't have like the capacity to be updating people all the time on like what was going on. And so like
I just like disappeared one day and moved back to I was living here. I was living in LA and and I went back to
Colorado to to try to get medical treatment and and um that was when everything just snowballed and got worse
and worse. So I was only supposed to be there for 2 months and that turned into what 2 years
and you just got more sick and more oppressed. Yeah. And you had seizures too, right?
Yeah. Then I started having Yeah. Like seizures all like I would tremor like shake like this all the time and like I
had problems going on with my brain where apparently what was going on was like parts of my my like neural pathways
had like died. And so I like I oh I was talking about this earlier like I
couldn't remember like friends that I had like like it was
it was weird and it was the scariest thing in the whole world like to show up
to the pharmacy and to pick up my prescriptions and have them tell me
somebody picked them up already. And I would say that that's impossible. And they're like, and then the pharmacist
who knew me would come over and she was like, "Hey, like you picked them up yesterday." Yeah. Like, and I would
start crying because it was so scary because I would like realize like I didn't remember anything the day before.
Like it was just like a black hole. Like it was just gone. Like it never happened. And Yeah. And like I I knew I was
missing friends in my head because I knew I had more friends than that, but I couldn't I couldn't remember them.
Wow. And like so this just all these things that you're mentioning, they kind of just it just progressed like a snowball. Like it
was just oh now my memor is gone. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It just got worse.
And it wasn't really like logical scientifically, right? Like it it was just like randomly happening.
Yeah. Like it's spiritual obviously. Just the oppression just continuing.
Yeah. Yeah. For sure. like it it didn't really make sense to anyone like
and it was so overwhelming I think to doctors that they were just
what were they supposed to do? Like I was just falling apart cuz all of this happened within like
a a year and a half maybe. Wow. Like it was a very short amount of time
for the list of things that like I had going on. And so you were in Colorado
and there there was someone who recommended Yeah. who shared
5F Church with you. Yeah. And so you share what happened then.
So she like I looked you up online and um
I knew that God was like healing people cuz I had heard about it. But I I heard
about like more healings than normal, but nothing compared to like what was happening at 5F. Like I had not heard of
that. And so And you had you had sought deliverance at this point other places?
I did. I saw it one other place that was really popular. And so I thought,
you know, this is where everybody's, you know, going and so like I guess this is but I wasn't seeing like results. And so
I thought that was really weird. Like I I didn't really understand that. And um
I started I remember watching your live stream
for the I think one of the first ones I watched I actually had been taught that I could do deliverance on myself.
Mhm. And um now I know that that is like not that
is like not a thing. I learned it through that actually because it didn't work. But when I had put on one of your
videos when I was like trying to do deliverance on myself like this thing started manifesting really bad and I was like that's weird. Like why when I put
on Apostle Kathern Crick's video this like starts manifesting like that's so weird. And then I had my first encounter
with God through the screen like I was watching online. Like I did not live in LA anymore. I was watching this online
and I didn't know what was happening at first. Like all I knew is it felt like there was like a weighted blanket on me
and all my cells like in my whole body felt like they were like buzzing and like I couldn't open my eyes anymore and
I just like fell back in my bed. Wow. Yeah. And like and I was like I my
thoughts were so slow and I was so at peace and I was like what's happening? I don't know. And I was like this has to
be God. Like this is God. I don't really know what this is. Like I didn't know
what the anointing really was cuz I heard that word thrown around at that point, but I I didn't I didn't have a
full understanding that like what was happening to me was he was touching me with his anointing. Like I didn't fully
understand that. And um I went halfway asleep and I I just especially felt it
like in my chest and then I like passed out and went to sleep and then I like woke up and I was like
something just happened. Like I don't know what just happened, but that was Jesus. Like I know that I knew it was
Jesus and I saw Jesus in your eyes. I've heard people say that and I saw Jesus
like in your eyes. Like and to clarify like I wasn't looking at Apostle Catherine and being like this is the
reincarnation of Jesus or something like no. Like I was looking in her in her eyes and I was like
it it was like Jesus looking through her at me like like looking back at me and I
was like what is going on? Like I never encountered something like that. And um
Glory to God. Yeah. Yeah. And so over the next couple months I just like kept randomly watching
online. I was not fully planted. I did get convinced by the enemy that like it'd be better if it was in person. And
if it's at pie bath, well, maybe it's other places, too. And there's this one place in town, found out that that was a
lie. So, I I I that was when I um I had
I think I had told you I sat on my bed that one day cuz I was so frustrated and I was like, "God, why can't I just be go
to that church online with that nice lady? She's nice. I I like her cuz she's
nice. She never says anything like mean." Cuz that was like the stuff I'd heard from other churches. like condemning and judgmental.
Yes. Yeah. Like like exactly. And so and he was like yes like yeah like go to
please go to 5F and you can be planted online. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And I was like
great. So, and then um then I started turning into a Pharisee because I was
like so the teachings were like different from stuff I had heard before.
Even though I wasn't really like I didn't grow up in the church or anything like it was stuff that I hadn't
I hadn't heard some of it. I shouldn't say all of it but I hadn't heard some of it. And
the the really sneaky lie that the enemy came at me with was
this wasn't because it was an anointed church. This was because you had such
great faith. It was just your faith that you got delivered. Yes. That I got delivered, that I got healed. All this like it was just yours.
And I was like, "Oh no." Like what if that's true? And God cleared that up by
by there were several things, but one of the things was like, well then why did that not happen at other churches? Like
I had the same amount of faith at that in-person church that I like went to. Like
I had the same amount of faith in that that did not none of that like happened at that church. And I just got really
confused. I was really scared. I was scared of you, but only because I was
afraid of all pastors. Like, because I only had had like terrible experiences.
Um, and then God told me to go to Flourish LA, and I was like, I don't
really want to, but I'm going to cuz he's asking me to go. And I didn't know
why. I Which was our first which was our first 5F church conference exactly a year ago
from now. Yeah. That we're filming this. Oh yeah.
And and um I didn't want to go. I even tried to back out at like the last second, but I
was like, "Whatever. I'll just go." And I was like, "God, if I go to this, please tell me if 5F is like legit or
not." This is your first time at 5F church event, right? Yeah. Yeah. And so, um, I went
and within like me even just being in the
atmosphere at Flourish LA, I felt like I already knew. Like I was like, no, like
this is God is here. Like Jesus is here. Like it was supernatural. Like my spirit
like knew for a fact. And I was like, "Oh my gosh." Like like this is way
different. This is way different. and and you came out and
I just felt the love of Jesus everywhere. Everywhere and like from you so strong and that weekend I was
delivered from generational curses, condundalini spirit, witchcraft, new age
spirit that came from a new age and I was healed from seizures. All of you on three must leave her in
Jesus' name. One, two, three.
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
Enough. Enough. Enough. Your time is up. This is This is the power of the
anointing. The demons have to go. They have to go. You see the power of Jesus?
I break every curse off of her life now. I break every word curse, every
generational curse, and I declare every spirit of witchcraft, every condundalini
spirit, every spirit coming from new age, every spirit that's tormented her
mind and brought confusion, every spirit that's come from her dabbling in witchcraft. I declare on three, all must
go from her in Jesus name. One, two,
three.
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. You are free. You are free. Thank you,
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. After I like went down when I like got
delivered, I had this encounter with God
that was like it was like nobody else was even there
anymore and it was just me and God. And I could hear the music. I was aware that
the physical realm like existed, but like I wasn't fully in it. Mhm.
And it was just like his love and like his just peace and like
like I like like I like met I like met him like here on this earth. Like I
didn't think anything like that was even possible. Like and I just remember like sobbing because it was just like you
love me. Like you love me. Like I had gotten convinced at one point when I was sick that that he hated me and that he
like thought it was funny like what was happening to me, which is like crazy to like say that now. And like
I like literally remember uh like screaming at him that I hated him and
and cussing at him, saying some of the worst things I've ever said to anyone to him.
screaming at him like for days and like was like it like I went from that to
like to this now and like just realizing like it was all a lies from the enemy and
like anyone listening to this yeah don't feel condemned if you if if you've ever been
in that position cuz like the some of the stuff I said and like just screamed at him like if anyone was going to get
like struck down my lightning bolt like it like it would have been me. Like I it
was I was so mad at him and and um but he explained everything and he did he
really heavily heavily did that through 5F and I went from literal like like the
closest thing to hell that I can imagine to the closest thing to heaven that I
didn't even think like was possible on this earth like at Flur Chalet. Yeah. And he even reminded me, he's
like, "Do you remember how horrid that was?" Like this was like the complete opposite. Like from literal like like
like horrible like hell, like the closest thing to hell I could imagine to like we weren't even on this earth. Like
it was just me and and Jesus. And it was like it was indescribable. There's so many
people who say that. They're like, "How do we find words to describe like Flourish LA?" I don't know. I do not
know how to find words to describe that like and yeah I became fully pl fully
planted actually um not just attending Sunday services but live streams everything that
weekend that Sunday so it was April 20 26th 27th 28th
um before that I want to you know you said that you got delivered through the screen that was the first time you got
delivered what was the change then after that what was what were you afraid
of then the first time. Yeah. Through the screen, I didn't know what it was at first. Like
I didn't really know what had happened. And I just felt so much more peace.
Uhhuh. And like joy and like like I just didn't feel like
so much death like carrying around in my chest and like I wasn't as like tormented in my mind. And so
I think maybe it was like multiple thing like layers. those layers and then God led you to come in person to receive
even more and much more. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So then you became fully planted.
Yeah. Yep. And um wow. I mean after that
it really is true that like there's there's so there's always more of God to be found. Like I thought like oh this is
it. Like I had this encounter and I now I know God loves me. But then that kept
happening was like, "Oh, well, I found this out. Well, okay, this is God then.
Oh, no, there's more. Oh, okay. No, there's more. Oh, actually there's more." And like there was never like a
lack of like more revelation of like his love, who he is. Like um equipping,
which was huge. I don't know what I was doing or what
anyone was like doing before this spiritual equipping. Like we're just I was just walking around like blind like
like spiritually blind just having no idea like why horrible stuff was happening in my life all the time. No
matter what I did like I tried to have hope and like the more I tried and tried
and tried to make my life better like the worse it got. And that was another thing Ashley had
said that I really resonated with like it was just hope and disappointment and hope and disappointment and it it never
ended. It just got worse. Like the nicer I tried to be to people, the worse I got attacked. Like the more like Christlike
I tried to be, the worse things got because I wasn't spiritually equipped. Like I didn't know how to defeat the
devil in my life. Like I didn't know why people, you know, acted so horribly um
that it was spiritual. Like I I didn't like know any of that. And so like um
yeah, it was just it it was I it's still hard for me to like
comprehend that we have like the blessing of this
opportunity to like to have these spiritual truths from God. Like to have
the anointing to like have these opportunities like
I know God was present in my life before. I know he was like, I know he was, but
this is so far beyond just ditch your lukewarm church. Like,
ditch it. I'm telling you right now, run away. Just just ditch your religious
church. Like, like just just go. It's worth it. Like, it's 100% worth it.
You're you're going to live a life that I've never felt like this. like I've
never felt um like like that I like wanted to be alive like
that I like wanted to live and that like I feel like I resonate with Ashley's testimony a lot because that was one
thing where I would look at people who like they seemed like they were happy to be alive and I was like wow that's wild
like I wish I had that like that's so crazy and like I just thought what's
wrong with me like what's wrong with me and I looked into science like I was really into science and um what was
missing was the spiritual piece. Like yes, like it does affect you physically, it does affect you emotionally, it does,
but that core piece is spiritual. And that was the part in science that that
wasn't there. And that like it was like whispers of it everywhere. We had evidence of these
things, but like the concrete like root of the stuff that I studied was missing,
which was like it's demonic. Like it like the the spiritual realm is real.
The devil is real. Like like this it's it's so real. Like it it's not even like
just oh well, you know, we just choose to believe in that. Like it's it's so undeniable. Yes.
And Yeah. It's amazing. And then you I I remember a powerful
deliverance of yours. You received more deliverance. So now this is another layer of deliverance. You received um
several months. So okay. So you came you you received deliverance online. That
was in 2023. The end of towards the end of 2023 or Okay. Yeah. And then you came in person for the
first time to to a fivef church to five of church and to a five of church event at the flourish conference. our first 5F
church conference a year ago. So like a few months later basically but I was going I was attending online
sometimes in between there. So then you were planted and you did you
see change once you became planted? Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Huge. Like huge
like every every area of my life like started like getting like better like better just better. like I could see
things with hope which was that was a really hard thing for me. I tried really hard but but I really could see things
with hope. I really could see God accurately like even when I was getting
attacked by the enemy which yes of course that happened after I became planted like that of course like he
didn't want me planted at God's anointed church but again the equipping you know
you're equipped to reject it and to know what to do and I just saw
just peace in like more peace more and more levels of peace in like every area of my life and that was something I ever
had. It was just like chaos like everywhere all the time in my mind, outside my mind. I wasn't like known for
being the person that had everything bad happen to them all the time anymore.
Like, which is wild. Praise God. Yeah. And then, okay, so that was April. You
became planted after you were delivered so powerfully and healed of a lot of things that you mentioned earlier.
Praise God. And now you're seeing so much transformation in peace and equipping victory over the enemy after
you become home planet in April. And then fast forward to December flourish
conference Dallas. Five of church flourish conference Dallas. And I remember you got delivered powerfully of
another layer of oppression. Can you share what you were delivered of and just like your experience? You have a
powerful story I've heard you share leading up to that moment of deliverance. Yeah. So, I was delivered
from word curses, which was a huge thing. I think I think that was layers,
too. But there was like a massive layer um like taken off because I that was a
major thing that that I had dealt with. Um and condemnation, spirits of condemnation. Um
so, yeah. So, at this point at 5F, like I was I I wasn't afraid of you like how
I was because like I had been like healed and delivered of like church hurt and things. Yeah. Like I had no negative feelings towards
you at all. Like I like you were my spiritual mom. Like I had already declared that like made this covenant with God. Like I was like, "Yeah." Like
totally there's no issues. Yeah. So I knew this wasn't me when this happened. Mhm.
So, I was getting ready for Dallas session. I think it was session one. I
was getting ready for for Dallas that day for Flourish Dallas and I was like doing my makeup and I was listening to your
video like a heart prepared to receive I believe it was and um
all of a sudden like out of nowhere I got like this shooting like sthing an
like rage and like anger and hatred just like violent anger that like shot
through my chest like I like felt it like physically almost it was so strong and it just it was just like it was just
hatred towards you and I was like it was so strong I like stopped doing my makeup
and I was like God what the heck was that and like I knew what it was but I just like
I'm in constant I I try include God and everything and so I was just like what the heck is that?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um cuz it's not me and at that point like I Yeah. I mean, I knew what it was.
Um, that it was a demon meeting. Yeah, it was a demon. And it was interesting because the weeks leading up
to Dallas, I when you would talk about Dallas and I
was watching online, I would get these shooting feelings of like horrible fear. Wow.
That were not mine cuz I was hyped to go to Dallas. Like I was like, "Yeah, Jesus." Like I like I had no fear at
all. And yet something in me attached to me was like shooting fear like up and
down my chest. And I was like, "Yeah, you better be scared." Like, I know what that is. Yeah. Like I knew
what it was. And so I was like I was excited. I was like, "Okay, I know I'm
going to receive powerfully from Jesus. Like I know I know that he's going to deliver me more today." And um
I went and then sure enough like as I was
I was standing there and you said word curses and this thing
like shrieked out of me and then I I couldn't I couldn't really hear that
well anymore because like something else had completely taken over like my body.
I was there. I was aware of what was going on, but I the best way I know how to describe it to people is like it's
like I was in like the back seat and like somebody else was driving. Like I was there. I was aware of what was
happening, but I was no longer in like possession
of my like my body, right? this thing like takes over my body and
starts this demon and starts like shrieking like no no and I I could think
thoughts this time like at Flourish LA I couldn't think thoughts but I could also think thoughts and I remember thinking
that's the thing that was the demon that was so mad this morning cuz it was just like I felt that same
this things it wasn't mine but I felt its like rage like seething burning like
hatred like it just like I've never it was crazy like how much this thing
just like hated you hated Jesus hated his anointing was
just so angry that like that this it was like oh we lost like this was this was
like the one thing that we had was like what it felt like and we're losing right now
that's right yeah seriously Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it like lunged at you
and and was screaming at you and like
and I was conscious enough to be like like mad like just mad that it was
screaming at you cuz I was like don't scream at her like a spiritual mom. That's Jesus doing
this. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
Hallelujah. Every last one in her, every last one from her past, every last one
of condemnation, I declare on three, all of you must leave her in Jesus name.
One, two, three.
Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. I declare complete
freedom now in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus.
Jesus just delivered me so powerfully. So powerfully just like ripped that thing
out of me and I felt great. I mean I was I was fine. But this thing was not fine.
It was not fine at all. And I think I remember like falling back in the chair
and it shrieked more and then and yeah and Jesus just kicked it out and freed
me and it was like the best because oh my gosh like I knew in my head that God
wasn't condemning me. Like I knew that by then but I felt condemnation feelings like all the time. Even when I would do
the work of God that was when it was the worst and I was like okay well that's definitely not God. Like
Yeah. Yeah. And so after that, like I would do the work of God and I was like, "Wow, I feel normal. Like I feel like I
should like I feel like peace and joy." Like praise God. Yeah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus. Yeah.
So, wow. All the things that you described in the beginning, the oppression, the sickness, Jesus just
took that away. Yeah. All of that. All of it. Literally all of it. This is remarkable. This is miraculous.
times a million. Only Jesus. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
Seriously, like Yeah. I never would have imagined in a in like a million years
like like I knew Jesus loved us, but like all of that all of like all of
that. Like I have a list that I posted on my in it's on my Instagram. It's insane like how long this list is. And
like he just took it away like like
people need to know like he wants to heal like he wants to heal you like and he can heal you of
literally anything like he's Jesus like it's still I still just start becoming
in awe like when we when I talk about it because it's like
it's so much and so it's like what do I even what do I even like say what do I
even say like like what do I even say to Jesus for that?
Yeah. And the best thing is like knowing who he is. Honestly,
that was the best thing was knowing who he is cuz I I did have an experience um
where I did um I did uh I had I did have an experience where um
I did talk to him once um and he was the nicest person I'd ever
talked to. Like like nice doesn't even cover it. like the most benevolent like
just majestic nice times 10 billion level like person I'd
ever talked to in my life. But and that was years and years prior to all of
this. So I I didn't have anything to match that up that encounter up with like
being in my physical body and experiencing life. And then after 5F, I could match those two experiences up and
be like, "Oh, he actually is like that really is who he is." Like he like that's not like
that really is who he is. That's why he was like that. Like that's Yeah. Like
like he's actually like so loving. He's not mad at you. Like he's actually not mad at you. He doesn't hate you. Like he's
he he just loves you. Like he just loves you. And like
I just get I just this happens to me when I talk about it cuz where I just I don't know what to say because it's so
much that's happened. He's left us in awe and wonder. Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. So I see right now so
many people so many of you are going to encounter the love of God like never before.
You're going to encounter his power and his love. He's going to wash over you.
his grace, his power, his love, his goodness. It is time right now for you
to be free. I see that through this podcast, through this testimony, God has
lifted off scales off your eyes. Your faith has increased. And it's time to
encounter Jesus, the God of miracles, through the screen right now. Whatever
miracle you need, whatever freedom, healing you need, Jesus can do it. Did
you hear all that God has done for Autumn? What about for you? And I
believe Jesus, I know Jesus is going to move through the screen in power just as he did for her. The first miracle she
started receiving in freedom was through the screen. God's going to do it again now for you. If you have any bondage in
your life, renounce it. Just speak it aloud right now. And God is going to come and heal and deliver you.
I detach you from everything you're renouncing right now. Everything you've renounced. And I break every
generational curse off your life. I break every curse, every word curse. And I declare every spirit attached to what
you are renouncing must go from you now in Jesus' name. I declare every spirit
of suicide, death, infirmity, depression, it must go. And I declare
condemnation. Every spirit of religion, every spirit that tries to twist who God
is, tries to deceive you into who Jesus is and how he loves you. This must go
from you now. May your eyes open up in the spiritual realm in Jesus' name. May
the fire of the Holy Spirit come. I release it to you now. May God's love
fill you in Jesus' name. be filled with his power.
Hallelujah. May you never be the same from today. May you walk in revelation
of his love and walk in intimacy and relationship with him from today. May
you never listen to the devil's lies of condemnation again in your life because
there is no longer any there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ
Jesus. If you are a believer of Jesus Christ, if you are surrendered to him,
Jesus is never ever ever condemning you.
If you make a mistake with loving kindness, he's leading you a different
way. He's leading you into repentance through kindness. He's saying, "My son, my daughter, come this way. I love you,
and I don't want you to go the wrong way that you're currently going. Come this
way." Maybe he'll say it sharp, but make no mistake about it. It's full of
kindness and love and grace. Hallelujah. May you walk in his grace and his love
every day in your life from now in Jesus name. Amen.
Thank you Autumn for sharing such a powerful testimony. I praise God and
give him the glory for the uncountable miracles he is. I
don't even know how to even put a ballpark number I know on the amount of miracles on the amount
of demons cast out on the amount of sicknesses healed cured praise sometime count it and and and let
me know okay you might might not even be able to keep track but Jesus
Jesus leave us in awe and wonder is so good is so good we praise you Jesus thank you
for joining me on the revival is now podcast be blessed and have a blessed rest of your day full
of joy, peace, and the love of Jesus. Amen.
