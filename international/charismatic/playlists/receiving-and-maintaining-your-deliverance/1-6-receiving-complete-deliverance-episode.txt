Hallelujah so today I'm going to share a very important message
you will learn today how to receive complete deliverance
amen Hallelujah so
there are certain Keys spiritual keys that unlock complete deliverance
um you know we hear in the Bible Jesus says to Peter
I give you the Keys of the Kingdom there are Keys of the Kingdom that's why
that's why so many Christians are lost are not walking in Abundant Life are
not walking in the inheritance that God has given them because it's not something so simple as just I you become
a Believer and you just get Abundant Life like that and and you're free from the devil
completely and you're completely protected just just like that just when you give your life to Jesus no there are
keys in the spiritual Realm that our eyes need to open up to so we can receive the kingdom Keys of the Kingdom
keys that unlock the kingdom of God keys that unlock your healing and
freedom and Abundant Life amen
so the first key before I share the keys actually let me share this with you
so when it comes to the things of God it's not like a plus b equals c no
matter what you know it's not like science like you do this you do this you do this and then
this will happen if you don't do this then this won't happen so as I share this with you I don't want
you to see it in that way but but see it knowing that God is God and he can do what he wants and sometimes there's
exceptions sometimes there's mystery
you know well I did this and this and this and how come I haven't seen it yet but this person didn't do this and they've received the Deliverance
there's mystery there's exceptions amen I'm going to go over a lot of keys that
when you apply these you shall see complete freedom in your life
but then there's some people that they they just give their life to Jesus or maybe they didn't even give their life
to Jesus they're like God if you're real deliver me right now they have no faith and they're being
kind of prideful about it you have to do this for me right now or I'm not gonna follow you
I'll give my life to you if you do this for me and I've heard testimonies of like God showing up and freeing them and
then they give the life to Jesus I've heard that you probably heard testimonies like that right so that's
what I mean there's Exceptions there are times where somebody doesn't even apply any of these keys and they receive right
so this is first what I want you to know as I'm sharing these with you but God is a God who has principles
and that he wants us to follow these principles and believe in these principles of his kingdom and that we
would understand that he generally moves this way that this is how the anointing is
released this is how to receive freedom and so that we would step in line with his principles
understanding this is how God chooses to move yes he can move outside the outside
the box sometimes into different ways but this is his way and I'm going to get in line with his way
and be humble you know not like God you can do whatever just do it but
be humble and learn what are these Keys Lord and I want to do what you are
requiring what you want for me to do to access your kingdom amen
so this is the first key the biggest key of how to receive Deliverance freedom
from demonic oppression number one is to position yourself where the anointing is
released where it is flowing because in Isaiah 10 27
it says it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off
thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because
of the anointing the Yoke some people just read past the
scripture some people don't like the word anointing but excuse me the word anointing is in the word of God
[Music] [Applause] some people say what about Jesus Jesus is the anointing
[Applause] that's just religion if people have a problem with the word anointing
it's it's the missing of the revelations of what's in our word that's keeping people in bondage
yoke means demonic oppression uh yoke in the Physical Realm is
speaking of ox carrying something heavy a brace across their neck pulling weight of humans or Goods and it's a brace and
they're locked in and it's really heavy a heavy burden on their neck they're trapped they cannot remove the Yoke on
their own they cannot with their Hooves or whatever like take it off
they would need a human to help to take it off them
so in the spiritual realm demonic oppression cannot be taken off by ourselves cannot be taken off by
counseling by self-help books by good teaching
it is only the anointing that will remove the yoke
this is the biggest reason why most Christians are in bondage today because the anointing truthfully has been rare
in the body of Christ what is the anointing the anointing is the power of God that God himself puts
in a vessel and he moves through the vessel in power
God can move any way he wants God can do miracles from the sky and like I said
there's exceptions God can heal somebody in their room without any vessel
and I've heard testimonies just like I shared of that happening people being free of addiction just in the room
no vessel praying for them but generally God's principle his main
way of healing and delivering his people of releasing Miracles is by his
anointing his power put in a vessel and the vessel walking in obedience to God
and in authority so the vessel speaks and declares
and when the vessel does that walks in the authority God's power follows and
God's power is doing all the Miracles so we command the demons to go but we
are not making the demons go it's Jesus in US flowing through us making the
demons to go [Applause] amen
so Jesus when he was when he was speaking to the disciples
sharing the commission the Great Commission to them he was telling them
preach the gospel tell them that the kingdom is at hand and cast out demons and heal the sick
raise the dead so this is God didn't Jesus didn't say like a whole long thing
of like the commission it was simple it was not a lot but what's Wild is that
these days we're only usually doing preach the gospel when it's not even like how do we lose
all the the rest of it it's not that complicated what he the assignment he gave us to do
amen okay so Jesus did not say to the disciples pray to me that I will come
down from heaven and cast The Demon out of a person he says You cast out the
demon once again it's not us doing the
Miracles but he chooses to put the anointing in us and we have to walk in
the authority cast The Demon out walk in the authorities so the power can move through us so the fact is that the fact
that Jesus says cast out the demons cast the cast out demons heal the sick that's
showing to us that this is God's main way of moving in power of releasing
miracles of freeing his people is that he would put his power in vessels and his vessels would walk in authority
and he would move through the vessels that's his way of moving
amen that's how it's supposed to be hallelujah we're all supposed to be
powerful [Applause]
hallelujah hallelujah this is what we see from Elijah to Elisha Elijah was
doing all these Mighty signs wonders and miracles raising the dead Healing The Sick
Fire coming down from heaven making it rain and then Elisha his spiritual son
was doing the same exact Miracles received the mantle from him received a double portion even was doing even more
miracles than him then we see Moses Moses split the Sea by God's power
it was Mo his he lifted his staff and the Sea split he would put the staff in
the water it would turn to blood the signs and wonders were done by Moses
walking in authority and God's power moving through him but all of those Miracles and signs the Deliverance of of
all of those Israelites out of Egypt it happened by God using a vessel in power
it's just God's way of moving amen
and then we see in the New Testament we see we see as Jesus said this Great
Commission cast out the demons heal the sick raise the dead and then we see all of these Apostles all of these
disciples we start to see prophets evangelists we see them walking in God's
power we see Miracles happening when we read the book of Acts you will see this happening again and again these Apostles
these disciples these Fievel ministers walking in God's power
and even if you want to to ask yourself like or ask God how did miracles happen
in the acts Church what should we do go to the book of Acts
right that's where we'll find the answer not from other religious Doctrine you've
been listening to go in the word of God go in the book of Acts and that's where you will find the
answer how were people receiving healing and freedom what were they doing
amen let's do that let's go to the book of Acts right now and and find out what
they were doing acts 5 12. the apostles performed many signs and
wonders among the people so once again here we see this is God's
way of releasing his power moving through vassals the apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people
and all the Believers used to meet together in Solomon's kalanad um we're going to go to 14 more and more
and men and women believe in the Lord and were added to their number as a result people brought the sick into the
streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's Shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by
crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits and
this is my favorite part oh of them were healed I get excited every
time I read that scripture because the word of God's Alive oh I'm
getting more and more Revelation from that every time I get more and more excited we're gonna see this in our day
that every person that comes to the service is healed
because it happened back then through normal Ordinary People this was through Peter it was happening
Apostle Peter and he was just a fisherman and God moved in power through him and
all were healed
believe there is our answer it's not rocket science
position yourself where the anointing is flowing and simply be healed and free
it is not about one-on-one prayer it's about positioning yourself where the
anointing is like for all of you here today every single one of you and you watching
online you have positioned yourself where the anointing is released and flowing
and so you are in the shadow like back then Apostle Peter Shadow it was
speaking the sun was coming down and his shadow was touching people today the shadow is everybody here
everybody watching online so you were all here so guess what that means the anointing must hit you all
Jesus in power must hit you touch you all
that's it it does not say anything about they had to get in this long line and
line up for one-on-one prayer with Apostle Peter it does not say that
it's so powerful it doesn't even say he was saying a bunch of words and it definitely doesn't say he was even put
in hands he doesn't say he was screaming loud it
doesn't say that there was a big fight with the demons the anointing was so powerful in him
and so all he had to do was walk in his
authority he might have said something like as I pass by this anointing must come
and touch every person here and every demonic Spirit has to leave as I pass by every sickness has to be healed he might
have said something simple like that you don't even have to say words even because the anointings just are when
you're walking in your Authority you're already walking in your Authority demons already get scared and have to leave because it's like fire coming upon
you the words is an extra oomph you know extra Authority but the
authority is already there so it could have been something like that and Peter just walking by and it
says that all the demons and sickness left people just by him passing by
so easily they were leaving why was it so easy for them back then to receive healing and deliverance and it's not so
easy today by and large in the body of Christ because Peter carried the anointing that's what we need the
anointing it's the anointing that destroys the yoke amen
Hallelujah so this is literally the biggest key of how to receive Deliverance this is the biggest one to
position yourself where the anointing is as we could see with Peter that's all that was needed sometimes that's the
only key that you need that's the only key that you need to unlock your deliverance is to Simply
show up or simply tune in online and boom that anointing hits you demon
sent out you're free that's it sometimes sometimes there are other keys that are
needed to unlock the bondage because the Demonic torment is a little bit more complex or just based on your case in
the spiritual realm there's another key that's needed to unlock your freedom
the next keys that I'm going to be sharing with you these Keys when we use these keys to
unlock the freedom what's happening is these keys are making the demons
grip to be loosened it's making them to lose their legal
access sometimes just showing up where the anointing is that's all that's needed
the especially the higher level anointing that there is
that's and we know Peter was walking in a higher level Peter and Paul we see walking in higher levels of anointing
even Acts 19 11 it says Paul was walking in God was doing such extraordinary and
unusual Miracles through the hands of apostle Paul that they would bring handkerchiefs and aprons to the demon
possessed and sick they would bring them first to Paul touch him his anointed
body bring him to the sick and Demon possess and they would be free simple like that
and it says in Acts 1911 God was doing such extraordinary so we know there's
such thing as extraordinary anointing there's such thing as different levels of anointing and so the higher level the
anointing is the less keys that are going to need to be used for some people
now I once again this is not like a A plus b equals c it doesn't mean if there is such a high
level anointing like Peter's here today or Paul's here today then that means none of us have to renounce
it doesn't mean it like that but it does mean that not as many people would have to renounce for example not as many
people will have to use as many keys so it's not like a if there's a higher level anointing we only need the
anointing we don't need other keys it's not like a concrete thing like that sometimes because of the deep spiritual
torment or because of just how your spiritual case is you do need to use other keys
whether it's high level anointing or middle level anointing
but generally generally even some of you may have seen
the anointing even has increased here and so demons are going even quicker
than they used to I see that in my Ministry before they would not go as fast but now they'll go faster
you know it's having to do with the Demon's grip they're just like when the anointing's
stronger they're like ah I can't even hold on
amen but that's a big reason why sometimes there's more of a fight
sometimes it's because the person's not using the right keys that they need to but sometimes there's a big fight uh you
know a person's it's there for hours many times it's because that anointing
isn't strong enough they're seeing the demons manifest so much they're manifesting because the
person does carry anointing but that demon is able to hold on still
and they're being hurt by the fire of the anointing but they're they're still being able to hold on still
so what we what we need to do is to find out the legal access that the demons
have to have any kind of grip so this message that I'm sharing for you today is for you to know how to be
completely free yourself but number two as God's calling you to
cast out demons as well so you can know in the spiritual realm how to free
someone by God's power what keys are needed amen Hallelujah
so um this second most important key is
um the second most important key is faith
faith it says in Matthew 13.
54. I'm going to read actually the last verse 58 in this scripture Jesus came to
his hometown and because people knew him they could not see him as an anointed
vessel of God it was too hard for them they couldn't humble themselves enough and they were just like what
where did he get all this power so they could not have faith they could
not see Jesus as God in Jesus as God's power moving through Jesus they
only saw him as an ordinary man so they did not have faith they did not have faith in Jesus the
Healer and deliverer and so the Bible says verse 58 he did
not do many miracles there in Nazareth because of their unbelief
first of all notice it says he did not do many miracles other translations says he healed he
healed a couple this is where I'm telling you there is an exception sometimes so I mean if you bring your family
member that has no faith don't be all discouraged like oh I might as well not bring them because they don't have faith
no make room for exceptions of God this is why we're to take all limits off of God and be people of Hope no matter what
and not think wow they don't have faith though no God can do anything let this be the exception
if you have a family member by the way that does not have faith um if they will come with free will here
bring them let God do the rest God surely is here
[Applause] Hallelujah and and he and God will touch them they
will see maybe they refuse to watch videos before because the demons in them were like refusing to have them watch
um but now they're forced to watch and they will not be able to deny the
glory of God the power of God Amen so bring them and this is how faith will
even come and I love this testimony I shared it I think it was yesterday I shared it or maybe it was two weeks ago but
um like last year there was a mom who brought her son who was depressed did
not want to come to church he was a teenager but she brought him and Demon started to tremble in him when he was
there and he renounced and he fell down with the power of God and God delivered him he came up he took his glasses off
he says I can see and then he ended up having a whole encounter with God where God took him up in heaven and he talked
to Jesus himself and he was testifying like all these scriptures and on fire for God when before he wasn't really a
believer Hallelujah [Applause] I know there's other testimonies of
people watching online um I remember um there's a a woman part of our 5f
family um she she was like believing a little
bit but she just had the videos on she wasn't paying attention she was scrolling on her phone she was watching
one of my replays videos and Demon started to manifest in her and
she's not even watching and the demons were saying out of her actually
something like this shouldn't be able to happen this is this is the TV
like they were so angry because demons have been around for a while and Hallelujah yeah
take that devil take that demons battle Gets You Through the TV
[Applause] and she was set free and this woman is
on fire for God now she's trying to move here now she wants to move here from across the country to
be with us every week this has happened like a few months ago I think and then she was she said a couple weeks ago she shared how her son
didn't really believe but she just had him there with the video on and he was set free and now
he's watching the videos with her Hallelujah Hallelujah
so you know this is why this says God Jesus couldn't do many miracles except for
some he he could do some so there's an exception that if there
isn't faith God can still do miracles but generally this is the principle that you need to believe
and it's like this you can come here and be a sponge and soak up the anointing and so come
here humble open with faith like a sponge and you will receive so
much or you can come here and be a rock which if a rock is in a river if you cut
it in half it's dry in the middle so you can be like you could come here and not be changed if you're choosing in
your heart to be like a rock so if you want to receive the fullness
from God Freedom Miracles have faith increase your faith
speak aloud God I believe it's not about your feelings if you're struggling because the devil will try to come in
your mind with lies declare out reject him I reject every Spirit of unbelief every
live unbelief I Believe by his stripes I am healed I will be healed I will be free I believe
even though I've had this oppression or sickness my whole life many many years I will be free I will be healed I believe
even if you don't say it without enthusiasm because like the devil's attacks are so strong and you're just
saying I believe I will be healed that counts is faith God counts that is faith
so come with faith I don't mean get your feelings there your feelings will follow take the action of Faith to reject the
devil just get here and speak aloud I will be free I will be healed I Believe by his stripes I'm Healed that's having
faith that's having faith and so some of you you haven't received
complete freedom and it for some of you the key might be to increase your faith
you need to increase your faith and God will do it amen we see this principle also with with the
disciples with the apostles Mark 2 verse 2.
um there was a paralyzed man oh I love this
um they could not bring this paralyzed Mana because the crowd was so big and they brought him and they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by
digging through it and then lower than that the man was lying on when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralyzed
man's son your sins are forgiven when he saw the faith
and he was and he was healed and he was healed amen when he saw the
faith the power was released the woman with the issue of blood she she had this faith that if I
position myself where the anointing is the anointed one is if I just get there
and I just touch his rope that was the meaning the meaning of that was positioning herself
where the anointing was going to be released I know I will be healed she says and so she touched and got and
Jesus felt power leave him so there's this principle where Faith releases the
power this is powerful because Jesus didn't even say be healed he says
power left me you're already healed your faith has made you well
see it's not about one-on-one prayer it's positioning yourself and having faith
and the power is released and so me as an anointed vessel the anointing is Flowing for you the anointing is like
reaching out to every person and it's coming out stronger for those who have faith
it's nothing to do with one-on-one prayer it's simply having to do with
positioning yourself where the anointing isn't having faith pull the power out
whether you're in the front row one-on-one prayer in the back row watching online pull the power out like
that woman with the issue of blood and the power will just hit you without me having to give a one-on-one prayer for
you that's why so many times I pray for someone I declare a word demons go
Spirit go Spirit of depression go something demon screams out of somebody in the
back of the room sometimes it's several screaming I'm not praying for that person on one-on-one
prayer it has nothing to do with one-on-one prayer it's the anointing you're where the anointing is you believe the
authorities released and every demon has to obey the power of God comes upon
every person Hallelujah
Hallelujah I love this because there's a gentleman
I don't know if this family's here today precious family there's a elderly man he
looks like he's in his 80s or so and he has a a granddaughter or niece I don't
know family member and she and her I think cousin he's young he's like 10 or
something or eight or something and they come here some many times I don't know if they're here today but
um they she this woman she lifted the wheelchair up here
and I said you're like the the paralyzed man coming down from the roof and she says that's what God told me right now
that I needed to do that and and I declared over him and we
didn't see anything physically happen because that's many times not how it works it's in the spiritual realm that
things are happening and sometimes there's a physical manifestation amen but they testified the next week that
he's completely different he Hallelujah
Hallelujah he was having such issues with his mind but then he was like thinking straight and he was having conversations the little boy like the
eight-year-old boy was testifying too like my grandpa's back like he's joking
he said he wasn't doing that before and now he's a church praising God and she goes I've never seen him praise God and
he's praising God now and he's lifting his hands and singing Hallelujah Hallelujah
so it was the faith and it was sometimes it's the faith of family members just as Jesus says believe in your child will be
free your child will be raised from the dead your child will be healed he says this multiple times sometimes just your your child doesn't have to Faith
sometimes sometimes you have the faith and that's the key amen
we also see um acts 14 8 there was someone who was
lame he had been that way since birth never walked he listened to Paul as he was speaking Paul looked directly at him
saw that he had Faith to be healed and called out stand up on your feet at that
the man jumped up and began to walk so he saw it was like oh he has faith
for this miracle I'm going to declare it and release it to him so sometimes that faith is an important
key let God see your face so he can make that power come to come upon you amen
the next important key is surrender surrender to God one once again this is
not um like an absolute like rule because as I shared with you many times people are
unbelievers and they get delivered that's how it was with Jesus he was ministering he'd cast the demons out and
then he would people would get to know his amazing love through that Deliverance
so sometimes that's how it is and in that in that case surrender isn't required but to receive complete Freedom
especially surrender is very important you've got to be willing first of all to
surrender these the world's ways the open doors that you've allowed of the enemy you gotta actually close them or that legal
access is going to remain there they're having legal access because you haven't surrendered because you're keeping the door open because you're keeping the
relationship because you're keeping the alcohol in the drugs there
because you're keeping the movies you shouldn't be watched playing because you're keeping on speaking the
words of death you know you shouldn't be able to we learned um a lot we learned last week
the week before how sometimes you're being controlled by a demonic spirit in one of these areas so you
can't like shut the door technically I'm not talking about those situations
like um like anger for example a spirit of anger you
can try so hard to not be angry but there's a demonic Spirit controlling that part and so you need freedom
but once you're free you need to close that door you need to crucify your flesh when you get the urge to be angry you
need to stop because you're no longer in bondage and you can with God's help amen so um you got to make that decision
Lord when you free me I'm I'm never going to do these things again and these areas in your life that you don't need
freedom from you just need to crucify your flesh you need to crucify your flesh stop it stop the sinning close the
doors surrender to God amen
and you also need to surrender to God when you come to this place you need to surrender to God with however he wants
to touch you and free you some of you are looking too much at me you're looking too much at human vessels when
you need to be looking at Jesus you're thinking like so when I'm talking
about how Faith by the way is a principle you I'm also speaking about a specific kind of faith this is to rewind
to go back a little bit um when you come here you need to have the right kind of faith not just I
believe that God exists and that maybe he can heal me maybe he can do Miracles but you need to have the right kind of
faith of this is my inheritance from Jesus healing and deliverance and
Abundant Life so I know that I'm going to receive today this is my inheritance it's not a matter
of will God do it God if you want I wonder if you'll do it I'm coming to receive my inheritance is actually
already mine you need to come with the right kind of faith
because some people can have big faith in the existence of God some people can have beautiful
relationship with the Holy Spirit but they're not having the right kind of Faith to receive their healing and freedom and Abundant Life
you need to have the right kind of faith in that area and you also need to have the right kind of Faith with how God
releases his power the fact that he uses vessels
so you need to have that faith of okay I see where God is moving through vessels I see where God is like I've
located Apostle Peter Apostle Paul of today Elijah of today amen
I'm locating the kingdom of God where there's high level anointing
Hallelujah I've located it and I've heard testimonies and so I know that
when I go there I'm going to receive the anointing of God upon my life I know that as these people have been healed
these people have been free I will be free too because I'm coming where the anointing is this is a principle of how
God releases his miracles and it says in the book of Acts that all of them were healed who came under
Apostle Peter's Shadow so as I come to fiefold church where the anointing is
being released I too shall be healed all of them were healed then all of them will be healed today that includes me
and so I'm having faith that whether I'm sitting in the back I'm in the front I'm watching online I will receive the
anointing what your eyes are on Jesus when I said the anointing I mean Jesus Jesus in power so your eyes are on Jesus
not Apostle Catherine honor is great honor is important honor is very important it's very important to honor
anointed vessels of God but that's it no glory no focus should be on the vessel
honor thank you that's important that's actually a key of how to receive in more anointing but that's it we cannot go into the into
this Lane this wrong place of looking too much as the person is a miracle worker
and sometimes if you're having so much of when Apostle Catherine prays for me one on one then I'll be healed
no like it's it's good to understand where the anointing is being released yes but not to limit God
not to make my one-on-one prayer more powerful than God touching you however he wants
thank you amen so you have to have that right kind of
Faith some of you are having this wrong kind of Faith limiting God and thinking that you need to have one-on-one prayer
with just me and there's a reason God's not having me call on you because he needs you to get
out of this wrong kind of faith and focus on me and focus on him
and so that when the miracle some of some of us God knows some of you need that God knows that if some of you I
pray for one-on-one you would start to think it was me too much
so he's purposely not even having me pray for you one-on-one he's waiting for you to humble yourself
to receive this word that's being released and surrender to surrender to God how he wants to deliver you and
touch you and so some people some of you God has that plan for you to receive your
Miracle where you're saying where you're standing where you're sitting that's the reason why because he wants you to see
fully this is him doing it other people don't have that problem I pray for them they know it's God doing
it but some of you God needs it to happen this way and so you're you're holding yourself back from being free
because God's waiting for you to surrender to how he wants to deliver you
amen Hallelujah so this is also part of the surrender is
not just closing the doors but it's surrendering to how God wants to free you
and however it looks like unashamed of him whether you scream the demons scream
out of your word either your manifest or not who cares it's all for the glory of God
I Surrender Jesus whether people see it or not I just want
you to be glorified in you to have your way if people see your love and power
through my deliverance and it reaches Millions it goes viral Hallelujah I will be so honored as was Mary Magdalene in
the Bible who had many demons cast out of her and she was honored to be written about in
the word of God that Jesus set her free and she became a mighty disciple of Jesus
amen we should we need to have that heart and that surrender the next important key
um for some of you now so so these ones are like the really core main ones that
you should all really have the next key is not a key that is just like a rule
like you must do this but it is for some people it is going to be a key that unlocks freedom for some people and
that's to renounce and to renounce means to it means repenting and it means to speak aloud
that you do not want the devil's portion in your life anymore that you do not want to open up the
doors of the devil anymore that you acknowledge the way that demons came in and got their legal access you're
identifying and locating it's like you're going to court and you're getting this taken care of Legally you're saying
this is where you came in I renounced that I renounced doing the drugs are now sleeping around or announce agreeing
with this sickness spoken over my life and speaking again and again um I renounced that I and I renounced
the sickness I renounced the anxiety I renounced the depression I run out the Demonic Soul tie and when you're doing
that that's you legally coming in the courts of Heaven using your Authority in
Christ and saying I do not want him the devil anymore in my life I want God's
will I'm using my authority I'm speaking it aloud and and
legally in the spiritual realm the demons have to leave the devil has to leave when you give your life to Jesus this is your inheritance that demons
have to leave so this is sometimes part of the legal
way in the spiritual Realm of being free of the the demons are
losing their legal access because you are using your Authority it's not just your coming and you're
receiving the anointing but now you're really using your own authority so everyone should renounce
but but not everyone but for some or many it's a key for them to be free
so every single person should renounce that's simply saying I don't want the devil's portion of my life anymore I
don't want your will devil anymore and I don't want to open up these doors anymore I want God's will
every one of us should be doing that should be confessing these things out loud amen
but for for some of you this is actually going to be a key that unlocks your deliverance
that once you speak there's been many times I've seen um demonic torment becomes more complex
when demonic covenants have been made to say I want to die
I want to kill myself in the spiritual realm that's actually a demonic Covenant you're making with a spirit of suicide
Satan you're giving legal access for the spirit of suicide to come in so strong
so what happens is it's not a demon of suicide at first you're not in bondage but the Devil Comes outwardly to
everybody and the more we don't resist him the more he's allowed legal access to come
in but when we resist him he has to flee as the Bible says so this is how many people end up with
suicidal spirits and end up killing themselves is because the devil's coming an outward way with lies and they think
it's just truth and they don't know they can be free they don't and many people don't know Jesus can free them and they
just think this is they just have to live with this voice in their head every single second saying kill yourself
and So eventually they listen to it because they're tricked by the devil and they think that that's their own original thought and they think that
that the the lies of the devil that says your life will be so much better when you just kill yourself well even
though your life ends but this will end now this torment will end if you will just kill yourself they believe it and
so they do it that's it comes from it's this demonic attack that turns into a demonic spirit
so it starts as a demonic attack not not a spirit always
it comes as an outward attack not a demon within an outward attack saying you should die you should kill yourself
something like that and then a person is feeling it now they're feeling the lies and they say I want it I just want to
die and that becomes that open door where the demon now has legal access to come
in and now amp up those lies super strong
that's bondage now where a person needs deliverance and so many times I've seen
this as I ministered many times especially earlier earlier on I would
say suicide Spirit must go and a demon would still be there and the Lord would lead me to ask the person if they want
to renounce if they ever said I want to kill myself and they did and I asked them to renounce it the moment they
renounced it they were free foreign
there was also a gentleman um he made a deal with the Devil
he's in La he was a Christian but lukewarm in like low 20s and his his
uncle got in a car accident it was like about to die it seemed and so he was really desperate and he had heard in rap
songs that um about people making deals with the devil so he's like I guess this
might be real and he was desperate and he had no idea about the power of Jesus
and so he literally just like goes out in Hollywood looking to make a deal with the devil and like the devil could see
that so the devil sent him someone from Scientology
yeah yeah and the guy knew just what to do to help him
help him and so he literally made a he first of
all he asked the gentleman his name's Manny he the testimonies on my YouTube I'll have to reshare it's from like a
year and a half ago when the Revival just broke out I'll have to reshare after this so check out my social media after this I'll post it it's powerful
but um so he said to the guy Manny he said um
he said well you need to give up something this is the way of the devil
the blessings of God come without sorrow the blessings which are not blessings but you can get things from the devil
that you want but they come with sorrow so um he says I'll give up my happiness
so he's are you sure he says yes and so he had him actually take some blood and he signed in blood
and there's power in the blood and the word of God we see such power of it in the way of Jesus and even before Jesus that's why they were sacrificing animals
because there was some power in it to cover up the sins not remove them but cover so in the Demonic realm blood has
power too so it deepens the curse it deepens the Covenant
when the blood so so the deeper demonic torment comes in different ways for one
is a covenant to speak aloud I want to die or
um I want my uncle to live so you can have my happiness I'll give you that the
devil to speak that that's a covenant so that becomes deeper torment immediately and then blood Covenant becomes even
deeper blood signing and so this gentleman so this is the story of this
gentleman so now fast forward years later he is tormented he is so depressed
like never before in his life his life is awful because of this his uncle ended up Surviving but his
life was was horrible after like very sick even though he survived but and
then he had a dream one day of a female voice saying something like leave in the
order you entered him and he looked everywhere for this female voice because he knew it was God because
it was such a god dream and he was looking like a Joyce Meyer and everything and he couldn't find it
and then one day he found Fievel church he found my videos our videos
and Hallelujah and he was like that's the boss and so he came here and this is
actually Sean Bulls came that day and did a little documentary of it so you can see he he shares the video too but
um so he came that day and he demons were trembling in him so much
manifesting and I was command demons to go and there was and then all of a sudden the demon said
um we made a deal we made a deal and so I said allow him to speak and I
said did you make a deal with the devil he says yes and then he shares and he says I renounce this this deal and the
moment he renounced he was set free [Music] Hallelujah
Hallelujah and and um ever since that day he testified
later I did it live with him like interview like Weeks Later update and he said that he feels Joy like he felt when
he was five years old his Joy was restored and more since like
when he was five praise God hallelujah Hallelujah
so sometimes renouncing is the key sometimes this specific renouncing there's been times sometimes I minister
with people and um the Lord's leading me to say there's a covenant and this and then all of a sudden God will bring a
memory of when they were a child doing some weird Covenant thing that was actually demonic and they didn't realize
it was demonic but some weird Covenant like blood sister type thing or something with branding yourself with an
iron or something just different strange things you know like they think are harmless but is actually led by the
devil and it and it brought bondage and they renounced it and they were free
so if you've been into deeper demonic stuff in witchcraft you should know that
this is definitely going to be a key for you to renounce and to renounce specifically amen
Hallelujah so in Acts 19 11
uh it says God was doing extraordinary and unusual Miracles by the hands of Paul so
that even handkerchiefs that had touched his skin were brought to the sick and their diseases left them and evil spirits came out of them they became
known to all who lived in a thesis both Jews and Greeks and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified and exalted okay so listen to this next verse so this is upon speaking of Revival the
acts Church Revival of when many miracles were happening and then all of a sudden it says this verse in the same
passage many of those who would become Believers were coming confessing and disclosing their former sinful practices
this was actually renouncing this was not just like oh let me get this off my chest because we're the body of Christ
let me be open this was actually renouncing they were renouncing in the book of Acts
this is where we see renouncing in the Bible in the in the New Testament amen and and then the next verse says and
many of those who had practiced magical Arts collected their books and throwing book after book on the pile began
burning them in front of everyone they calculated their value and found it to be 50 000 pieces of silver so the word
of the Lord was growing greatly and prevailing this next key of receiving complete
deliverance is to throw away items that have demonic attachments to it
because uh as we see here physical items can have demonic attachments to it
that's why they were burning them so once again they're not burning it like I'm not a witch anymore take that
devil burning it no they were being free through this so we see renouncing and we've seen
renouncing these objects and throwing away the objects and they were being free this is what's Happening Here
Hallelujah so um there's many different option objects that can have demonic attachments to it
with demonic soul ties many times there's a demonic attachment to an item
jewelry many times sometimes a person could give you a jewelry and their
intention is in a manipulative way to keep you forever as theirs
this can be boyfriend girlfriend but this could be just friends uh girls and guys out there when you're
just friends and you're just wanting to be friends just be aware of these things okay because sometimes when a girl or
guy doesn't want the other one but the one does the devil will really try to work in
that Spirit of manipulation so be aware of that okay be aware when a
person is starting to seem kind of controlling and and not listen to you and force their way and be aware when
they want to give you jewelry if you're getting a weird feeling because of these red flags of
manipulation and control and not respecting you that's a red flag from God saying don't
accept that um you know there it's you sometimes you
can just take something but not actually receive it yourself and immediately throw it away that's fine we don't need
to be like I will not ever any gift from anybody you don't have to be like that you know
um but be led by the Holy Spirit if someone's being really forceful like you
don't have to feel like you have to like be nice and accept it just follow the leading of the Holy Spirit but know that
you're protected when in your heart you're not receiving it thank you I detach myself from this and
I throw it away amen um it doesn't have to be jewelry this
can be any kind of item that someone gave you and you felt manipulation on it
maybe you were given something and you noticed everything the bondage came after it
that is God showing you you should get rid of this um even like maybe somebody
gave you something and they did you wrong you know they but you love them you've
forgiven them but they really hurt you and you just keep seeing this thing it's like a reminder just get rid of it
you know just be aware that you do not need to feel like you need to keep everything you don't need to hoard
everything amen many of these things are spiritual and we need to really be wise
and aware of them if you have new age books New Age things
crystals that you've put your faith in for healing crystals in general are fine but when you put your faith in them for
healing or for something Supernatural that is opening a door to a demon
also I wouldn't go into a crystal store and buy like that were designed to be
for Supernatural powers and buy it so I'm saying crystals in general are fine but just walk in wisdom
you know I'm not going to go into a psychic store and buy a crystal you know
but to get jewelry that has a crystal in it that's okay you know Hallelujah
um so if you have had these crystals or other things that you put your faith in for Supernatural healing Sage you put
your faith in Sage to protect your house from demons that's demonic any anything
like crystals Sage anything uh tarot cards any object or method of of
accessing something Supernatural healing the Future Good Luck Prosperity that's
all demonic it's all accessing demon powers demonic powers so um it's opening a door to a demon you
can have a demon just from believing in something and having that item or going to a psychic and you know
that's how you can open a door so you should get rid of all of those things all witchcraft things all new age things
all things you put your faith in for something maybe even you had like a lucky ring and you thought that you know
it's not like that's a crystal or anything you didn't buy it from a new age shop but there's this ring that you just have this Superstition thing like I
have good luck when I wear this get rid of that you only need Jesus for everything amen
nothing else Hallelujah so this is sometimes a key that's
unlocking your freedom you need to just get rid of this thing that's in your house that you have um okay so I have something exciting
news as well on the baptism day on the 21st it's not just baptisms it's going to be
a full service it's going to be healing Deliverance the power of God moving
Amen on the beach so come expecting and if you any of you
have these objects that I'm talking about or God reveals to you after this message bring them we're going to get
rid of them there and you're going to be free on May 21st on the ocean amen
hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
okay those are the main those are the main keys and then the one last key I'm going to share with you is sewing into
God's Kingdom so to surrender to Jesus means to give
all of yourself to him he instructs us to sow into his kingdom this is an
instruction he gives us he actually instructs us to be generous so first of all to sow to give to God is
already an instruction from God our money is not our own so we have to be very careful that we when we feel so
resistant to giving to God we have to make sure we are freed from religious thinking you know where we're not seeing
the spiritual importance of giving that it's obedience to God that this is what
he's asking us to do and it's how we receive more it's how we receive more it's how we reap
we have to make sure we are seen rightly the significance the importance of sowing because in the church there's
been a lot of religious Doctrine there's been um when it comes to tithing giving and there's been abuse there's really
has been abuse where churches Ministries ministers abused money that came into the church
so we have to really make sure we we are free of things that are holding us back from sowing into God's true Kingdom
so we can receive all that God has for us amen so first of all it's important that we
know that being generous and giving to God's kingdom is already what God is asking us to do amen
so sometimes when there has been deep demonic torment demonic bondage
especially in past Generations especially if there has been witchcraft especially if you yourself or past
Generations have actively sewn into the devil's Kingdom given money to the
devil's Kingdom access demonic powers and done witchcraft when you're actively
sowing into the devil's Kingdom and being a part that means that there is going to be a much deeper torment
bondage and a stronger legal access of the devil
than just opening up doors of anxiety uh like speaking words of death you know
anxiety depression you know doing drugs alcohol those open doors to
Demons doing those things but when you're actively sewing into the devil's Kingdom
that that means there's going to be a greater bondage so this is when there's more keys that
will need to be accessed to release that complete Freedom the the grip is very
strong and we should humble ourselves to know that there's so many people who aren't free so that means that there
must be keys that have not been released yet
amen we need to Humble ourselves so and More in more extreme cases
when you have sowed so much into the devil's Kingdom when past Generations have sowed so much into the devil's Kingdom
when you sow into God's kingdom it removes the reaping of the devil's Kingdom quicker
to give your life to God to serve God to serve him in the church to serve him with whatever he's asking you to do to
be a vessel of God being nothing but love to others that's all sowing into God's kingdom amen
but also is sowing money into God's kingdom that's also sowing
and so when we also are generous in that part too it makes the reaping of the devil's
Kingdom be removed quicker it's more weight
and that's how we should treat sewing in general when you have needs even if you
are free but the devil is coming back so strong outward attacks not inward you're free but he's coming back so strong you
should sow a seed for this need I believe I am free this is me putting
my stake in the ground I am sealing what what God has done I believe in the power of this anointing
I'm accessing more now I'm I want to reap more of this anointing I want to
get rid of all of the reaping because many times when you're suffering those outward attacks after you've been
free and this is many of you some of you think you you need more Deliverance because the attacks are so much on your
mind but you're already free it's just that when you have gone so
much in the Demonic realm if you've opened a lot of doors in the past it's like the devil will try harder to
try to um take your freedom than he would to others who didn't open up so many doors
it's part of that reaping so you're free and you're still walking Abundant Life and you still have peace
and joy amen but your journey is just a little bit different to the promised land from Egypt to the promised land
than others who didn't open up as many doors so you need to take it seriously giving
your whole self to God sowing specific seeds for complete freedom
amen the more we give to God the more we reap the more we give to God in every way in
every way the more the devil has to leave the more you sow the more you'll reap
the Bible says whoever sows abundantly will reap abundantly amen test him in this amen hallelujah
with that being said we're going to sow to God right now you can bring the baskets forward
we're going to sow to God right now and some of you maybe that's
God's speaking to you right now I need to so I haven't been sowing enough to God I've
been withholding this part I haven't been making a big enough sacrifice maybe God is saying this is a way that that
reaping of the devil's kingdom is going to be washed away is you give more of yourself that you
have not yet now amen so we have um giving envelopes on
the back of the chairs um if you'd like to give online there's a QR code you can go to fivefchurch.org
