0:02
what are some red flags that would indicate one is stepping out of the will
0:07
of God there is something that I shared like a warning basically I I basically
0:14
shared what a red flag is without saying this is a red flag I shared this on Wednesday when I was speaking about the
0:20
importance of staying in God's Will and and and how to stay in God's will so one of the red flags I was talking about was
0:27
I've noticed this as a leader as a spiritual mother who has many spiritual children and who is counseling many
0:34
spiritual children often with certain questions and I've seen this happen
0:39
several times where a spiritual child will a disciple will be teachable be
0:45
asking questions be asking for advice but then when it comes to something very
0:51
serious honestly that they should be asking a question about they tend to be like God told me very adamant about
0:59
something and it's usually having to do with a person's strong feelings for something a
1:05
person's emotions really wanting something wanting something a certain
1:11
way or also old patterns let's say a
1:16
person in the old wine before they came into the new wine their way of hearing
1:22
God the way they thought was the correct way to hear God was so much seeing signs
1:27
so much looking at signs and God speaks through coincidences God speaks through dreams but also the devil can speak
1:34
through those things sometimes if you really want something the devil notices that you really want something and if he
1:41
knows that you're looking so much for signs from God he can come as an angel of Light disguised as an angel of Light
1:48
and bring a sign bring a dream that you know the devil can know
1:54
that something isn't in God's will but that you really want something and this can be a good gu Godly thing that's just
2:01
not God's will or it's not his timing for it
2:06
yet and so the devil knows this the devil can can really know this the devil can really know like the devil really
2:14
knows God's principles he knows the devil knows God's principles of order
2:19
the devil knows how people have selfish ambition and they want to do things really quickly and make things happen
2:27
the devil knows this right but God's way is to be a servant to not to to die to
2:32
selfish ambition and allow God to lift you and God's way takes time God's way
2:39
takes time you know when when you have a dream and it's aligned with it's a god dream like God put this dream in your
2:46
heart you know often times the Fulfillment comes later than you want it
2:51
and so many times they many times people have dreams whether it's career whether it's Ministry whether it's
2:58
marriage Etc they have a dream and it can be from God totally but they're not
3:04
supposed to make it happen on their own the person is not supposed to make it happen on their own but they're supposed
3:10
to wait on the Lord to open up doors they're supposed to wait on the Lord for his timing they're supposed to be like
3:17
so servant-hearted and be focused on serving and be focused on being a disciple and being teachable and growing
3:24
like that's where the focus is supposed to be but often times people shift the focus from there to to I want to make
3:30
this dream happen and completely take the focus off of being teachable being
3:36
servant-hearted and allowing God to have his complete way yeah so the devil knows these things the devil absolutely knows
3:42
these things the devil knows oh this is something that a person really wants and
3:48
if it is from God like the devil might not know this like if it's from God or not but the devil knows if it is from
3:54
God it's not going to be quick rushing the devil can think this is a way I can
4:00
divert them from the will of God show them signs show them um confirmations
4:08
that they should keep making it happen or going in this direction I've seen
4:14
this happen many times where a person they had their oldwine way of hearing
4:20
from God signs confirmations and not putting I mean making signs and there
4:26
these things they're seeing as confirmations these signs these dreams and these strong feelings these emotional feelings they're making that
4:32
the focus and they're they're having that be the focus and not the focus of
4:38
the word coming forth and the word of wisdom that they're receiving through teachings and Direction and and also if
4:46
it comes to big things to to asking your spiritual parent you know before making big decisions or things that could have
4:53
serious consequences repercussions if you make the wrong decision so yeah I've
4:59
seen people like just go back to old ways of this the sign when they when
5:06
they really want something holding on to the signs or taking the strong emotion that they have as meaning it's God the
5:13
strong desire they have for something as this is God so a red flag would be like
5:19
for yourself a red flag would be if you know you know yourself things that
5:25
you've unlearned you know yourself what how God has opened up your eyes and
5:30
wrong ways of hearing God's voice or the wrong ways to put focus of seeking God's
5:36
voice I should say as well because God speaks through dreams and God speaks through visions and God speaks in a
5:42
still small voice but it's so important that we don't just put the focus on there have a strong feeling and we think
5:50
this is the still Small Voice you know because we want it to be right or have this dream or have this
5:57
coincidence come up and we want it we want that confirmation we want to do this so we we just blindly take it as oh
6:05
this is a sign this is from God and then you dismiss really seeking God's voice
6:11
you dismiss the main way you're supposed to seek God's voice which is through his word through the written word and through the teachings of your spiritual
6:19
leader the the wisdom that that you have already received that you should already be in you now it should be just a part
6:26
of you it should be become part of your common sense it should be part of this wisdom that you have and also hearing
6:32
the word of God prophetically like on a regular basis you can be having so many
6:37
signs that you think are from God maybe because you want them to be from God but
6:42
then a prophetic teaching comes and it's a rescue for you God is literally sending help to you because he sees the
6:50
enemy's schemes and he sees you wrongly you're mistaking his voice thinking it's
6:56
him speaking or wanting it so badly that you are forgetting wisdom forgetting what you've
7:02
been taught and then God sends this word this prophetic word to to save you to
7:08
get your attention that's the main way of of hearing God's voice is through his word through the teachings through the
7:14
teachings you've heard in the past that should be a part of your wisdom now part of you now should be your wisdom now and
7:20
secondly always being ready for this prophetic word that's coming forth to
7:26
rescue you to redirect you to open your eyes to the enemy schemes to open up
7:32
your eyes to how you've been maybe in the flesh how you've been chasing after your own desires yeah so the red flag I
7:40
would say would be when you find yourself going back to Old Habits like that and you find yourself being overly
7:49
confident in hearing God's voice when you deep down no you shouldn't be you should be more teachable and humble and
7:59
open to direction from your spiritual leader whether that's one onone like in
8:06
an email for example or whether that's you know asking a question here and the
8:12
answer coming forth or whether that's just a prophetic word corporately that God knew you and others needed to hear
8:20
right now and you receive that correction that's a big red flag I would
8:25
say is being overly confident in hearing God's voice and his Direction when you know deep down you shouldn't be you
8:33
should actually be open teachable and not moving in haste knowing even in the
8:39
past probably how you've been wrong about hearing God's voice how you've ran with emotion sometimes and looking back
8:47
you know that was not God I wanted this so badly that I fooled myself I allowed
8:54
myself to be deceived by the angel of Light you have to learn from those mistakes it's part of hearing hearing
8:59
God's voice every single one of us I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure every single
9:04
one of you myself included in the past have been wrong about hearing God's
9:10
voice and I know myself included I really wanted something before there was
9:16
one time I really wanted marriage and I really wanted something to happen with a
9:21
man and I really thought uh based on signs and even I had been single for so
9:27
long and there seems to all these coincidences and like Signs and I was
9:34
dismissing the red flags about this person and one of these red flags was that he didn't value me he started to
9:39
show like not interest in me and instead of me seeing clearly this person
9:46
actually isn't valuing you I would I was thinking this is spiritual warfare this
9:51
is the devil trying to take this person away from me I believe we're supposed to be married during that time because I
9:58
had so wrongly thought I was supposed to marry this person even though it was Christians can be hilarious
10:04
sometimes we Christians can be hilarious sometimes like overp spiritualizing
10:10
things and the emotions can really the devil can really get in the way and I I was really hilarious by hilarious I mean
10:17
really not having wisdom and being too overp spiritualizing things because this
10:22
person and I I've shared the story in the past but this person we never even went on like a date before I had just
10:29
hung out with this person in a group I had just hung out with this person like one time just very casually oneon-one
10:36
very simple casual and I talked to this person on the phone like I think three
10:42
times for maybe like an hour each time Christians can tend to be this way Christians in general really desire
10:49
marriage and desire it young as well and Christians in general like this is part of the old one we have to get out of
10:55
many Christians don't walk in wisdom and do just what I was Shing about previously is like we we jump onto signs
11:03
in haste because we really want something we we think things look good on paper and the emotions are so high
11:11
and everything and it can be hard to find a Christian partner if you're a man
11:16
it's hard to find a Christian woman if you're a woman it's hard to find a Christian man it can be difficult it can be years in you're thinking in your
11:23
heart like where's my husband where's my wife you know you're thinking this then you find someone that there's there's
11:30
there's an attraction there and so since it's can be hard to find you can think well because this person's Christian
11:37
because I have an attraction and then maybe you add on some signs it's like oh this has to be this
11:43
has to be the one this has to be the one you know so that's what I mean Christians can be hilarious sometimes
11:48
it's like like it's like silly I guess silly is what I mean to say like overs
11:54
spiritualizing things and really not walking in wisdom I was acting that way
12:00
because I really thought I was supposed to marry this person but it was based on signs and things can be really manipulating sometimes in this new wine
12:07
I teach a lot about how it's very important to not like we shouldn't be forcing visions and we shouldn't be
12:12
forcing prophecies when we do that we are opening up the door to the angel of Light and our imagination is really
12:19
powerful very very powerful and so sometimes when you seek out Visions
12:27
instead of like letting God give you Vision when he wants but like you so badly want a vision you so badly want a
12:35
prophetic word for somebody that you cross the line e eagerly Desiring to prophesy eagerly Desiring spiritual
12:42
gifts and to hear from God in different beautiful ways you cross that line into
12:49
forcing it and when you do that number one your imagination can be really powerful so you can just be creating
12:56
Visions yourself you can be creating prophecy yourself self prophecy or you
13:01
could be opening up the door to the angel of Light to actually give you a
13:06
vision Vision or give you a prophetic word and the more you are being like
13:13
forceful in this way Crossing that line that's the more you're opening up the door to the angel of Light but at first
13:19
it can just start as imagination if you close your eyes and just start thinking
13:25
for a while you'll start to see things it's our imaginations are powerful and we're very visual
13:31
people so I remember one time I met this person in a place where they were
13:36
definitely I would say Crossing the the line like really seeking after these um
13:42
visions and prophecies and everything but praise God that I didn't I wasn't
13:48
like forceful in my heart I I thought at that place in that Circle that I was a part of this is before I met my
13:54
spiritual father Prophet Jord Davy so this is before my eyes really opened up to the true new wine and um the true
14:02
prophetic and the true anointing and so it was when I was in like other charismatic you could say
14:10
like circles and so I was like prophecy is amazing prophecy is so exciting and
14:15
beautiful and amazing and I was just so excited about it but praise God like the Holy Spirit just gave me this wisdom
14:22
that it felt you know like it felt like fake to me and wrong to like force it so
14:28
I didn't so that wasn't my intention and so therefore I wouldn't be seeing like Visions if I was like closing my eyes
14:34
with along with everyone else and waiting to see something I wouldn't really see anything and same with like
14:41
prophetic so praise God God protected me in that way to have that wisdom and you
14:47
know not have that desire that I needed to look important spiritually or something and compete with others or
14:52
something so I remember like with this person we were praying together and he
14:58
was like what is is God showing you and is God showing you anything and I didn't see anything like I didn't see like a
15:03
vision I'm like no and then I said what about you and he
15:09
said he saw us holding hands and God looking down and smiling upon us and to
15:16
be truthful I think probably that was like an imagination type thing or to be truthful I don't believe in my heart
15:23
that that was actually I know that that was not this prophetic
15:29
Vision God was giving this person but at the time you know in this place of me
15:35
wanting this and in this place of seeing a lot of other like similarities between
15:41
one another that to me seemed what at that time without wisdom I thought were signs and confirmations so when I hear
15:48
this I'm like wow God is speaking this so that's where I I went into this like
15:55
wrong belief that I was supposed to marry this person and so all of a sudden
16:00
after this this person just all of a sudden didn't show interest to me it was just like ghosted me type thing and I I
16:07
was just asking like what's happening like why you know and and I remember being like I would say the lowest in my
16:13
life and it wasn't that low because God's grace like I have been just a joyful person my whole life and I never
16:19
experienced depression but I would say that this was one time in my life where I was so sad and just crying every day
16:27
because honestly because I was under this wrong belief that the devil was trying to steal my husband and trying to
16:35
Blind him and drag him away or something really the truth was I didn't have wisdom at that time and I didn't know
16:42
how to really hear God's voice and I was chasing after visions and signs and it wasn't that complex of like this is
16:50
spiritual warfare like me saying that he was like not Desiring me I was overp
16:56
spiritualizing at that time to be like this is the devil trying to steal him honestly he just wasn't interested and
17:03
he wasn't valuing that was it and the truth of was that I deserved better that
17:10
God had a higher standard for me and I deserved someone who would really value
17:17
me and desire me that was the truth that was the that was the simple truth that
17:24
was wisdom I didn't have at that time when you have wisdom you know how to discern you know how to discern these
17:30
circumstances you know how to hear God's voice God is so good he saved me because I remember prior to that I was really
17:38
seeing myself in God's eyes more than ever before I had a high standard for myself I I believed I was really Valu in
17:45
myself and I believe that God had a big calling for me I believed it was Christian music at the time but I really
17:50
believe God had a big calling for me and I reme and and and I've I've shared this story with you all before and some of
17:55
you might not have heard it it was one week after I go through this really hard time that I'm just describing that I
18:02
went to the conference where my now spiritual father prophesied to me where I met him for the first time prophesied
18:08
my calling and if I had still been with that like in relationship with that
18:15
person I don't think I would have gone to that conference and a big reason I went to that conference was I was just
18:21
in a just in this desperation for Jesus like I was so sad that so down so conf
18:28
confused that I I was going to just a Christian event like different
18:35
Christian events like every single day of the week that week you know so H God is so good to close the wrong doors and
18:43
to help me save me when I was so deceived at that time really I mean
18:49
thinking so wrongly something was God's will so see after receiving the prophecy about my calling then my spiritual
18:56
father he was my spiritual father at the time this is first time I met him but he also prophesied to in order to um get to
19:03
what I have prophesied like in order for you to fulfill your purpose like God's
19:08
calling for your life what I just prophesied you have to value value yourself a little bit I see scars from
19:14
men treating you wrongly so basically just like disvalued my eyes in that day I remember
19:19
going back home and being like my eyes just opened up through that prophetic word like wow this was not spiritual
19:25
warfare like this person was just not the the right person for me this person didn't value me God has so much better I
19:33
was being hilarious silly and just like chasing after signs and just you know it
19:41
was my dream to be married in my mid to late 20s and I was actually no my dream
19:46
was to be married like by 26 and I was 25 at the time you know so that's why I
19:51
these emotions were just like taking over yeah so I give that example because
19:59
that example that I just shared with you happens to Christians a lot you know where they can get swept up in their
20:06
emotions they can get swept up with something that they really want that's a good and godly desire but that they
20:12
really want and the red flag that I'm talking about is just getting swept up
20:18
in all of that and so badly wanting something that's good and godly so you
20:24
think you can dismiss the true way of seeking God's voice you can dismiss
20:29
wisdom you can you think you can dismiss wisdom you think you can dismiss humbling yourself to hear the prophetic
20:35
direction from your spiritual leader so if you catch yourself being overly
20:40
confident not in a good way not in the right way you know you know you know
20:46
yourself you know yourself you know how God has opened up your eyes and taught you the right way if you find that and
20:52
if you find yourself really wanting something that's actually an indicator to humble yourself more in that area
20:58
whatever it is that you really want that's a red flag in itself of like
21:05
just be careful to not move in haste just be careful to you know not follow wisdom but instead follow other ways to
21:13
hear God like Signs and confirmations and emotions
21:19
beware things that you really want can really be from God but so many things
21:24
that we really want from God are not in our timing but come later but the devil will always give an
21:31
opportunity to have it earlier it's like the devil showing Jesus the world
21:36
tempting him in the wilderness saying look you can have all of this just bow
21:42
down to me but Jesus had everything Jesus was Lord Jesus at that time was a
21:48
human he was like held back from being like the father you know like he was he
21:54
was held back by his physical body he's held back by the persecution in the way
21:59
that the people would put him in Chains so there there was that temptation but
22:05
after he was crucified and resurrected everything belongs to him you know and
22:10
it already did but he had to go through this time of being a human that was not easy that was not comfortable Jesus did
22:18
when he came as a human in a human body with the limits with the hardships with
22:24
the suffering that comes with a human body so that's why that was even a
22:29
Temptation for Jesus he had such a pure heart so it's not like it was a very
22:35
difficult decision I don't mean it like that he was sinless but just like but he would be
22:41
hungry right he would be hungry and so that's why the devil would tempt him with with turning the stone to bread
22:46
because he lived in the physical body he would be hungry so that would be a Temptation because he was sinless and so
22:52
pure so holy he was able to deny it but it was still a Temptation so that's why
22:58
Jesus being shown the world it was kind of like a temptation to skip past the
23:04
hardship of his purpose that's like what the devil was tempting when you're a Believer the devil will many times tempt
23:11
you with good Godly things but giving them to you prematurely and it's coming
23:18
from the enemy so it comes with sorrow it's not actually coming from God so it's not protected and there will be
23:24
consequences there will be such sorrow that comes with it because the Bible says the bless of God come without
23:30
sorrow so if the enemy gives you something even if it's a good Godly thing blessing it seems and these this
23:38
includes things out of God's timing this includes things out of God's timing and sometimes it can be like the enemy is
23:45
coming to the angel of Light saying do this fast so it's not really like the devil giving it to you I mean but
23:51
technically you followed the devil instead of God so it can be like God wants you to receive something but you
23:59
grab it before God's timing because the enemy sent you to grab it you you see so
24:04
it's like you are going the enemy's route and so that comes with sorrow it
24:09
comes with bad consequences it comes with opening the door to the enemy it comes with going out of God's will it
24:16
comes with unforeseen things that you wouldn't know yet until later when you have been equipped with wisdom you will
24:23
know you will feel you will feel conviction that will be your red flag you will feel conviction when you feel
24:29
like you're going in your own way you're moving in haste you're moving too fast you're moving based on signs that
24:36
weren't from God but you wanted to be from God can the same thing happen if we move too slow well I would say it's not
24:44
such necessarily slow but I would say Disobedience like if God is asking you to do something and you don't do
24:50
something delayed obedience is Disobedience so yeah it's the same principes God can want something for
24:57
your life and but you're moving too fast and it's that's Disobedience and it's
25:02
missing God's will completely God's asking you do something you're not doing it you're not doing it that's Disobedience so you're missing it so
25:09
whenever God asks us to do something it's so important we do see have the fear of God and see the seriousness of
25:15
it and not treat God as someone casual you know like Lord I don't know I don't
25:21
I I feel uncomfortable doing this I'm nervous to do this just give me a little more time to work up up the courage I
25:29
just I'm just not ready yet like we it's very important we never treat God
25:35
casually like a human or something you know but we have the the fear of God
25:40
When God Says something we have to do it we have to do it it's so important we do
25:45
it it's so important we obey him quickly how do I know if I'm complaining or
25:51
expressing a concern to my husband I think you can know deep down
25:56
communication is important in conf ation is important resolving things is
26:01
important many times there's miscommunication that takes place especially when you're in close relationship with people
26:07
miscommunication can happen very easily we we communicate differently it's like
26:13
you you have to communicate together to make sure that you're not missing things
26:18
you're not misinterpreting things things aren't getting missed confrontation and talking about things
26:25
and sharing concerns that's very important complaining is like whining
26:32
complaining is selfishly expressing I'm mad at this I don't like this to
26:39
communicate a concern is very important sometimes to make sure that there's not
26:45
miscommunication happening number one number two to resolve an issue that's
26:52
very important so whenever you are communicating to express a concern for example the heart should be to want to
26:59
resolve a conflict the heart should be to make sure communication is is good
27:05
like you're understanding each other for example to want a better result like to
27:11
want if it's a relationship if you're working together on something if it's marriage for example that your marriage
27:18
would Thrive more that things with the children any issues going on resolved
27:23
you just want the best kind of marriage the best kind of home the best kind of family most Godly family possible if
27:31
there's concerns your heart should be coming from there when that's your heart then you will speak with love you will
27:37
speak from this place of just wanting to help now if if it's the opposite heart
27:44
is like selfish the opposite heart is like I'm mad I want this fixed selfishly
27:51
I want you to know you did wrong I want you to know I'm in the right I'm hurt and I want you to know it and I want you
27:56
to perhaps feel bad that you hurt me this is just really frustrating me and I just want to vent that's complaining
28:04
whining that's selfish you see it's two different heart postures the previous
28:10
heart posture of just wanting things to be better for everybody that includes
28:17
yourself too but for everybody for things to be better for everybody things to be fixed that's important you
28:24
communicate and that's not something to feel guilty about out and it's very important you communicate because
28:32
sometimes it's it is your responsibility to express a concern that's going to
28:37
lead to the problem being resolved otherwise a person may not know that there's an issue in some area so it's
28:43
your responsibility to to speak up if the other person doesn't know what issue is going on but you are afraid that it's
28:50
going to be complaining or something this issue keeps on festering you're the one that sees there's a problem type
28:56
thing you know so you need it's your responsibility to communicate and to
29:02
help this get resolved type thing it's very important to not be like afraid of Confrontation it's very important to not
29:08
see confrontation as a negative bad thing but confrontation is just a part
29:14
of communication and a part of making sure that you're on the same page United Moving Forward rather than maybe
29:20
mistakenly thinking negatively about someone when they maybe they just didn't know the issue so you you you need to
29:26
communicate and not be afraid of it and not think of it in a negative way even if you're bringing up a concern when we
29:33
don't quickly obey does God still give chances or Grace yes please watch my previous live if you haven't on
29:38
Wednesday because I teach on that so in depth if you listen to any my messages you hear me share about the grace of God
29:46
always so it's very important for you understand that God has so much grace
29:51
however there is such a Mis there's such a lacking of the fear of God and there
29:57
needs to be a balance of the fear of God and Grace for so long people have been
30:03
just taking advantage of God's grace and not having the fear of God and not
30:09
understanding the consequences of not having the fear of God even especially in this year I've been prophetically
30:16
sharing the importance of the fear of God always remember God has so much
30:22
grace God has so much grace but I share something very important like a important re ation for you to grasp of
30:30
this past Wednesday I shared this like I shared my own example okay for my calling think about like for me to say
30:37
yet think about those of you here you wouldn't be here right now right if I didn't obey and you know God had this plan to
30:46
have me lead fivefold church and have me be a spiritual daughter of my spiritual father Prophet Jord Avy and to impart
30:52
the anoint the anointing in me and for the anointing to move through me and people be healed into delivered by God's
30:58
power many people around the world like that was God's plan and so I I said yes and like God's plan is taking place if I
31:06
said no God would have to raise up somebody else and maybe it would be years later that the timeline might
31:14
change if I had said no and I don't know if that person would have would be if
31:20
they would what city they would be and just it's all crazy to think about all these factors because we have free will
31:26
we have we absolutely have free will it's crazy to think about the domino effect if I was resistant at first if I
31:32
said no or I wasn't sure God probably would have given me time he probably
31:40
would have kept speaking to me kept nudging me this is really me speaking Catherine I know this is wild and crazy
31:48
and new something new and out of the box but this is really me speaking you know like Joseph Joseph immediately was
31:55
rejecting of Mary Mary received immediately Joseph he first rejected he
32:02
first didn't believe he first rejected his calling of being the one to stand beside Mary and help raise Jesus and
32:09
help bring Jesus into the world he was first rejecting of it but then God
32:14
continued to nudge him gave him a dream and then he oh this really is God
32:20
speaking and his his Destiny wasn't ruined because he didn't obey the first
32:27
time okay that's a great example of God's grace so that's what could have happened with me well I just give that
32:32
example if I chose to be like Joseph but if months passed God kept
32:38
nudging God kept speaking but I kept ignoring kept rejecting and I just kept
32:44
adamantly saying no that season of Grace would have passed God was wouldn't sit around and try to convince me for years
32:53
and meanwhile people aren't getting set free and healed and and equipped no you
33:00
know God would have to move on he would have to move on and raise up
33:06
someone else and it would have looked different than it looks today people would be healed people would be
33:11
delivered people would be equipped but it would look different from how it does today might be different people that
33:16
were it might maybe it was in a different city I don't I don't know it's just it's it's it's interesting it's wild it's wild to think about how we
33:24
have free will and how there is such power in our actions of
33:30
obedience and I speak this to help the fear of God grow in you all let's say
33:36
after months I kept saying no I don't know maybe I would keep on pursuing music I wouldn't be living in my purpose
33:42
God raised up someone else maybe I would come too finally and
33:47
repent months later years later but I know that I wouldn't be walking out the
33:53
exact purpose that I am now it would look different and it wouldn't be God's best it could still be amazing it could
33:59
still be an amazing life and an amazing purposeful life God has so much grace and he redeems but I do know that if I didn't
34:07
obey in in that season of Grace upon Grace upon Grace I just kept saying no I
34:13
wouldn't be living the life God intended me originally to live so I share that so
34:22
that you can understand God has so much grace but it's so important we don't
34:28
have a wrong understanding of his grace that we disvalue his grace we mistreat
34:33
his grace and we just think oh it'll always be there so just whenever I feel
34:39
like it you know I can just go on to the life that God had planned for me there's
34:46
consequences and you can completely repent years later and God will still
34:51
give you the most amazing Abundant Life when you fully repent but it wouldn't be the exact life God originally planned
34:59
you to have amen so I share that I hope you can understand like that you shouldn't have fear you shouldn't have
35:05
regret like if you yourself know that you disobeyed God for a long time you
35:10
shouldn't have like regret I don't mean it in that way and you you know you look at Saul who became Paul look at how God
35:18
redeemed him so greatly what I'm talking about right now is like when you know better Paul didn't know better until God
35:24
opened up his eyes I'm talking about how we can really change like the course of
35:29
Our Lives if you know better and you're saying no that's the difference whereas
35:36
some maybe God has a purpose for somebody to be Apostle Paul of today but they're currently like like Apostle Paul
35:43
but they're currently doing very evil things but maybe this person wasn't born
35:48
into a Christian home so that was just going to that just happened because of the person's past God knew the family
35:56
life he was in in the back had circumstances around him and God had this plan to do what he did with Paul
36:02
and open his eyes and give him this life that he plan for him you see when your
36:07
eyes have opened up it's different God's grace is in his will he's telling you
36:13
very clearly this is my will come under my grace so if you're choosing you know
36:19
better but you're choosing to not be in his will you're missing his grace
36:25
whereas someone who's like he they're they're living an evil life but they just don't know about Jesus
36:32
they didn't grow up in a Christian Home they've had horrible wrong influences God has to go and save them and open
36:38
their eyes and then they begin this it begins this process of your eyes are
36:44
opened my grace is here come in my will and be under my grace if you choose I
36:50
want to disobey God I'm going out of his grace and then you repent you can come back in his grace but what I'm trying to
36:56
communicate is that there are consequences for abusing God's grace and
37:03
not valuing him and not revering him once your eyes have opened up you have to make the continual choice to follow
37:11
God's will to live in his grace this is why I speak with passion so much
37:19
especially when God moves you prophetically especially for my spiritual children because I so feel the
37:25
heart of God's if if anyone is ever here I so feel God's heart saying come come
37:32
back come back come back come in my will my plans for you are so good come back
37:38
in my will that's why I speak prophetically when God leads me in certain Seasons to speak like this
37:45
because I I know the importance of fearing God and being obedient to him
37:52
Hallelujah when your eyes have opened up stay in his will stay in his will
37:58
hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you God this has been such a powerful time today
38:05
thank you Lord thank you Lord I know God has released so much wisdom I know God has poured out
38:12
Revelation opened up eyes and protected you from being deceived protected you
38:18
from being deceived by the angel of Light today hallelujah hallelujah I
38:25
thank God that I can go before you you know I get to share I shared a I shared
38:31
a mistake that I had made before my eyes opened up before I had a spiritual leader and I just I share that because I
38:39
want you to learn from that that's a that's a purp a big purpose of spiritual leader is to teach you so that you don't
38:47
have to go where your leader had to go had to go through you can already be equipped with that wisdom instead of
38:53
having to make the mistake and learn from your mistakes so that's a passion I have for you is for you to not have to
39:01
make mistakes and learn from them but to really really take my words with value
39:08
take them to heart and know that I'm sharing my heart with you I'm sharing so
39:13
honestly and I just feel this this this passion for God this this heart from God
39:19
for you to stay safely in his will stay safely in his will every single day to
39:27
walk in wisdom every single day hallelujah hallelujah it's possible to
39:35
live in his will and this is God's heart for you it's possible to live to not be
39:41
stepping out and having to live with consequences and then having to make your way back in it's possible to stay
39:47
in it Hallelujah all it takes is true surrender daily surrender daily humbling
39:54
yourself to be teachable so you can constantly hear the word of the Lord
40:00
when he's speaking to you ah you're about to go the wrong way go this way stay on course my son my daughter amen
40:09
