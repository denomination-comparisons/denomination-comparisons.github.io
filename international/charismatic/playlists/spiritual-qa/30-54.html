Should we tithe out of a budget
0:00
should we tithe out of a budget or more spiritually well we see the example of
0:07
the woman who just had a few coins and that was all she had and she gave it all
0:13
and so she didn't hold on to one of the coins but she gave it all she didn't um budget the coins that she had and Jesus
0:22
commended her for this Jesus said you have given more than all of those
0:30
wealthy people who also gave but Jesus that that speaks to us that they
0:37
were holding on to holding on to some more and it didn't really move God's
0:43
heart like it did when that woman gave um so but but that being said it's not
0:50
meaning that you know when when Ren is due and we have bills to pay that we just give
0:57
100% of our money as a tithe always um no absolutely not it's a balance it's a
1:05
balance so um the general rule of thumb is to be generous in your giving instead
1:12
of um giving what's comfortable because for most
1:18
people well I I don't know about most people but a lot of people tithing uh
1:24
only 10% would be comfortable um just like I'm just saying
1:30
this out of like um just saying that a lot of people let's say are middle class
1:37
or are having you know not extremely wealthy but not um in poverty so if if
1:45
if all of those people were to give just 10% then they would have a lot more that
1:51
they could spend on themselves than what they were really giving to God they would have a lot left over beyond their
1:58
you know basic bills and stuff and so um it's going to look like it's
2:03
going to look different in different seasons of life like when when God blesses you with so much
2:09
more finances then it will probably look like giving quite more than 10% because
2:17
if you have if God is blessing you with so much more financially then um if
2:23
you're giving much more than 10% you still would be comfortably living probably you
2:31
know but if someone is in a place where they're just paycheck to paycheck God still wants them to tithe and that
2:37
principle would be of like the I mean the principal for in that case would be the woman who um gave all she had the
2:46
coins that she had um so it it's just different with every season but instead
2:53
of thinking of it as like okay 10% goes this is how it should be looked at 10%
3:00
must go to God if I don't give 10% as an offering to his work to his to his
3:05
church then that's stealing from God as it says in the Bible it says in Malachi
3:11
that we're robbing from God if we don't give 10% um so we should always have
3:17
that in our hearts but we should also know that 100% belongs to God and so um
3:24
when we when we have this 100% we give it to God it means god what do you want me to do with
3:31
this what do you want me to do with this all of this that you have given me and
3:37
when you earnestly take that to God and earnestly see and God will put on your heart I want you to give more here I
3:45
want you to give more to the work of God he will put it on your heart when you
3:52
genuinely humble yourself and surrender that to him so um so to to to answer the the um
4:03
the question um it's it's not I can't it's not a clear
4:10
like I can't say do you budget or not you there's Seasons you really like budget but there are seasons God is
4:17
asking to just give Beyond and trust me and I it doesn't make sense if you
4:23
give um all of this then logically there won't be enough for this but God asking
4:30
that's what he did for that woman who just gave everything you know he didn't
4:35
reprimand her and say why didn't you budget now you won't have enough um for for food and everything you know but um
4:44
we have to walk in wisdom too uh where God has provided I've given you this I've given you this to to pay for this
4:51
and this and this we have to recognize oh he this is him providing and it's okay for me to use this to pay for this
4:59
bill and pay for this bill I don't have to feel guilty using this to pay for
5:04
this and this Amen in general we should be giving
5:10
more than giving more than like spending on ourselves there will be seasons of
5:16
course when I I mean like God wants you to buy a house for yourself or God wants you to buy a car for yourself you know
5:22
there'll be there'll be Seasons with big expenses that are okay like you don't have to feel guilty about it you know
5:29
but in general most seasons are going to look like God wanting you to be giving
5:36
more than spending on yourself my teenager has been engaging
How do I navigate friends with love
5:41
rebellious and dark things she has two friends practicing Witchcraft and one of the parents is H ranking it seems like
5:47
an assignment how do I navigate friends with love um so when it becomes to this
5:53
almost adult like age of a child it's like you it's this transitioning
6:00
of you know not I mean letting them have letting
6:06
make letting them make their own choices and letting them have free will and so it's a balance where if you see that
6:12
this is like something is too dangerous then it's it's okay to put your foot down you know but in
6:22
general when holy spirit is convicting you like this is being too
6:28
controlling you know you have to allow her to to have free will in those types
6:33
of situations when you feel Holy Spirit speaking that to you
6:40
um just gently and with love talk to your
6:46
child um just about these spiritual things and you know talk to them just
6:53
with love and not for forcing like not like just from the depths of your heart
6:59
you know just sharing with them you know these are things that God taught that God's revealed to me and I didn't always
7:05
know these things and I I you know when we don't know these things then it can
7:12
be opening up the door to the enemy and so I want to let you know these things
7:19
you know I don't I'm not forcing you I'm not you know forcing you to live a certain way and live the the exactly way
7:26
that I do but I love you so much much so I want to share these things with you so
7:32
if you can talk in like a gentle way like so that that that your your child can really see that you're doing this
7:40
out of love nothing but love it is planting seeds and it's okay if it
7:47
doesn't look like they see are taken it as that maybe they act annoyed or something but if you have done it with
7:55
love God has moved through you therefore you have planted
8:01
seeds you have planted seeds don't don't worry about how they react you have planted seeds and it will it will lead
8:10
to them being convicted in certain situations like oh this may be dangerous
8:18
I shouldn't do this and just put it in God's hands just
8:23
just put it in God's hands knowing that his hand is upon your
8:31
child amen how should we prepare for the flourish
How should we prepare for the Flourish Conference
8:40
conference well number one the greatest way you can prepare
8:45
is by being expectant and being hungry
8:50
by just reminding yourself renewing your mind every day leading up to
8:57
it of the prophetic words about about it like what God has spoken how it's going
9:02
to be like the day of Pentecost and that it's going to be a day to receive more
9:08
than ever and something so special and rare and fresh and unique from the Holy
9:16
Spirit greater level the words that I've shared the
9:21
words that I've shared you know I shared in that um a message specifically about the
9:26
conference um called for greatness was the message a few weeks ago watch that watch it
9:34
several times because it's really the word of God's it's God
9:40
speaking what to expect and that's the greatest thing you can do
9:46
is to is to see accurately to see accurately spiritually
9:54
like to see accurately this is what's going to take place I am going to receive from God
10:00
like never before
10:06
because the more you're hungry and the more you're expectant the more God can do it's a
10:13
principle the more he can do so that's the greatest thing you can
10:19
do is be expectant and be hungry and how do you be expected and be hungry by
10:25
seeing rightly spiritually like like like um like let's
10:32
just say um you know Jesus Jesus like told you you are going to heaven
10:41
like I'm bringing you to heaven I'm going to show you around I'm going to give you a tour you're going to see me face to face you're going to hear my
10:47
voice audibly like like imagine Jesus like told you that and he says it's
10:52
happening on this day it's happening in a couple weeks on this day at this time
11:02
imagine how you would be imagine like what you would be like every day leading up to
11:07
that you would be just so expectant and so hungry and
11:15
excited and ready like just that's all
11:20
you were living for was that day like just ready for that day um and the reason why is cuz you're seen you're
11:27
seen rightly you're seen spiritually you're seeing the the truth like this is
11:32
what's going to happen you know um so you need to be like that you need to see
11:40
rightly you need to see rightly like see see the spiritual Truth by having faith you know by having
11:49
faith this is what God's going to do it's going to be such a powerful
11:55
encounter with him that will change my life forever forever I'm going to be
12:01
freed of the things that were holding me back I'm going to be catapulted into my
12:06
purpose I'm going to receive anointing like never before impartation like never
12:12
before this is what is happening I've seen it like I've seen it meaning I've
12:19
been told and I know it's happening it's not wishful thinking I
12:24
know this is taking place so um that's the key to receiving in the spiritual
12:31
realm is seeing rightly which means having
12:37
faith and being out of the carnal mindset of just like waiting for like
12:45
wait to see and um being distracted by the world and forgetting what God's
12:50
revealed to you you know it's remembering what God has revealed and
12:55
living in that place and being expectant Hallelujah that's the greatest thing you
13:02
can do um like the like Jesus had spoken to the people um before the day of
13:08
Pentecost you know wait for wait for me I am wait for my spirit my spirit's
13:14
coming so they knew they had an appointment with Jesus
13:19
they knew with the Holy Spirit they knew the Holy Spirit was going to come and come so powerfully like the
13:28
most powerful Encounter of God was coming they knew it and that led them to
13:35
be focused be all in one Accord you know they were all gathered one place all in
13:41
one Accord they weren't distracted they were focused um and so they were able to
13:48
receive all that God had for them God will never
How to know where to be planted
13:53
disappoint I'm so excited I'm so excited
13:58
she's asking a question about like how to know where to be planted God wants you God wants all of
14:06
his children to be planted in a true church in a true church where God's
14:11
power is this is your key to being equipped to
14:17
have victory over the enemy this is where you will receive impartation of anointing to walk in your
14:24
purpose so it's where you're equipped and receive empowerment the ano anointing to help you fulfill your your
14:31
purpose on this Earth it's so important it's also where you have your it's also where you have covering where you have a
14:38
supernatural protection of a powerful anointing the same anointing that makes
14:43
demons Go is is upon you and covering you um so
14:50
this is crucial it's not something to take lightly it's something crucial something very important for every
14:57
believer's life and to be planted can be online it can be online if if um the
15:04
church that God's calling you to be planted at is in driving distance to you then he's absolutely calling you to be
15:10
there in person no ifss or buts but if the church that God's calling you to be planted at is not in driving distance
15:16
then there's a special Grace over you where you're not missing out just because you're receiving online
15:25
granted there will absolutely be times where God wants you to come in person
15:30
and receive such as the flourish conference there will be appointed times he will speak to you I mean there's just
15:36
different examples I mean we Laura from Germany God spoke to her come for three
15:41
months um in person you know he he'll be speaking to his children different things come come for a week or come for
15:47
three months or come once a month or you know he'll speak that to his
15:53
children to come and receive in person as well how can I stop the voice of the Enemy being Spen to somebody who has
15:59
cancer how to speak life over them um so it sounds like this person may not have
16:06
the spiritual maturity and knowledge that you do about this great power of God that's
16:13
available to destroy every yoke including the Yoke of cancer and infirmity and that it is truly an
16:21
inheritance of every believer to have healing from Jesus of all diseases including cancer so that's the real
16:28
issue is my people perish because of lack of knowledge so if this person is open
16:35
to listening to teachings then you should share with them like some of my teachings for example teachings about
16:42
healing that I have um when if you go to my
16:47
um uh uh playlist called Revival army training Revival army training
16:56
um just scroll and you'll definitely find find messages about I know there's
17:03
at least one message that says how to receive healing I believe um
17:11
and like EXA like that one for example um and also I know there's a message
17:16
about the Full Gospel or and your inheritance in Christ anyways if you can
17:23
send those messages to the person if they're open to to listening to them that's the main thing is that they need
17:29
their eyes opened up to see what's theirs because they don't know because
17:36
they might not know that healing is theirs and instead they think that sickness is their portion so that's the
17:42
biggest thing is that their eyes need to open up they need to they need to know the truth so that they can be set free
17:47
as the word of God says and um and you can share it with them too share with them too the truth
17:56
and what you've seen how you've seen people be healed of cancer how you've been seeing people be healed of all kinds of
18:01
diseases could you clarify what scen spiritually means so I've um shared this recently I think on the past couple
What is spiritual
18:08
subscriber q&as I think but I'll recap a little bit right now the biggest thing about scen spiritually honestly
18:14
means means having knowledge of the spiritual
18:21
realm so me saying that I see God's love for
18:27
me right now does not have to mean I'm seeing a
18:35
vision of Jesus with his eyes welled up with
18:42
tears and just looking with the most love I've ever seen it it it
18:48
doesn't for the most part it won't mean that it can mean that it can mean sometimes that one has a vision like
18:55
that but to say I see Jesus's love for me or I see Jesus love for
19:02
you really the biggest meaning of that the core meaning of that is I have
19:09
revelation of God's love for me I I have Revelation from his word
19:18
from encounters with him from his anointing from like prophetic words
19:24
spoken to me I I I have now out this
19:30
knowing in me of God's
19:35
love and so when I say I see God's love for me it's not talking for the most
19:41
part about literally seeing something physical or seeing a vision but having
19:48
the knowledge the faith so when we're talking about seeing
19:55
spiritually that's the main meaning
20:00
not to Discount Visions but the main way of seen is
20:09
knowledge of like Revelation not not not not not um not worldly
20:15
knowledge but spiritual knowledge
20:24
Revelation like when I see um
20:29
when I if I see demons manifesting in a
20:36
person I can say I I see this demon is tormenting this
20:44
person and but it's not I'm not it doesn't mean I I I'm seeing the actual
20:50
demon physically like a vision and I'm seeing physical attributes of a demon or
20:57
I'm seeing physically a demon wrapped around a person in some way in their
21:03
around their neck or something but seeing having the knowledge the
21:09
spiritual Revelation there is a demon oppressing this person in this way and this way and this
21:15
way um when I sometimes even if I say prophetically I see this for you um
21:22
prophetically it's not necessarily and many times not meaning a vision
21:29
but it's a revelation a prophetic knowing that God has impressed upon me
21:37
given me open up my spiritual eyes in terms of knowledge spiritual
21:43
Revelation so that's the main way of seeing
21:49
spiritually we walk by faith and not by sight and um you know
21:59
Thomas um doubted and he doubted that Jes it was Jesus when he when he
22:06
returned after being resurrected and appeared to the disciples he doubted and Jesus says blessed are those
22:13
of you that that believe without seeing now he allowed Thomas to touch
22:21
his to touch he had holes still in in his in his hands from the nails and so
22:28
Thomas got a physical sense experience that others didn't in terms of feeling
22:34
and seeing like watching his hands go through Theo his finger go through the
22:40
hole of Jesus's Jesus's hand he saw that right so he had an experience others
22:46
than it and Jesus actually said blessed are those who believe without
22:55
seeing if you find yourself not seeing things physically and even visions and
Not seeing
23:03
stuff it's not an indication indication that you are less spiritual in fact it
23:09
can be an indication that God sees your
23:15
faith that he can entrust you with more I don't mean that if you see Visions it
23:21
means you're like Thomas No No No Visions are are absolutely from God and absolutely um something that he does so
23:28
beautiful you know I'm not discounting that but I'm saying what I'm saying is that we shouldn't be chasing visions and
23:35
we shouldn't when we are not seeing Supernatural things it does not mean
23:41
that we are less spiritual at all it can mean quite the
23:46
opposite um and so God we please God by Faith by having
23:53
faith so the even like the the more that we are not like seen
24:01
physically but we believe that's pleasing
24:06
God hallelujah and I know I've seen in my own personal life I've seen in my own
24:11
personal life I remember um 10 years ago 9 years ago and about
24:20
about 9 to 10 years ago is 8 to 10 years ago is when I first
24:29
well no it's more like eight eight about eight to nine years ago is when I first
24:34
encountered God's power and when I first was in around people who were open to
24:41
God's power and the gifts of the Spirit and the Supernatural and there was that time 8
24:48
to nine years ago before I met my spiritual Father which was seven and a
24:55
half years ago it'll be eight years in September and so there was that period of time
25:01
like 8 to nine years ago where I was in these different Circles of people I was around these different people who were
25:07
super into the Supernatural and it was my first time being around these people and um I really felt so insecure that I
25:15
wasn't spiritual enough that I didn't hear from God enough that IC because because so many people were talking
25:21
about having visions and and having these like very tangible sensory experiences always like every like like
25:28
all the time um and I had had my tangible encountering god with the
25:37
senses sensory experience like um one time with the
25:43
baptis of the Holy Spirit and then a couple other times through prophetic words um but uh I was not having visions
25:52
I wasn't seeing like seeing physically things like other people seem to be
25:59
and I really thought man something's wrong with me or maybe I'm not being
26:04
quiet enough before God I'm really trying to listen and be quiet and
26:09
just close my eyes and you know I'm not seeing anything like I don't know if
26:15
something's wrong with me like I used to I really would feel insecure about that and
26:21
then I I met my spiritual father and everything changed I mean the wisom I
26:28
received about how God works how God speaks everything everything God
26:34
everything God's kingdom just the wisdom that my spiritual father has is unmatched from anywhere else I had
26:42
learned from received from um and it was a knowing that like
26:47
this is truth this is truth I've longed for this is God like everything just made sense it just like clicked you know
26:54
and it answered all those questions before and so one that that's one of the things to answer the questions of is like I God spoke to me like you weren't
27:01
missing anything like for you're you know like I I was purposely not showing up in that way because I wanted to
27:07
stretch your faith I I I I want you to believe in me without signs I want to
27:12
you to believe in me without seeing something that's so like undeniable like
27:17
it doesn't require Faith you know um if I if I'm if you're constantly just like
27:22
seeing visions all the time it doesn't really require Faith you know um and hearing the audible voice it doesn't
27:29
really require as much Faith so um God really revealed that to
27:34
me and he revealed that to me that it's also not just me personally but this is
27:40
his main way of how he moves that he he usually moves in a still Small Voice um and when he does give Visions
27:48
they are more rare they're not like all the time all the time usually I mean God can move out of the box if God wants to
27:54
give somebody a vision every single day and move in that way and speak in all the voice he can do it I'm not saying he can't do
28:01
it but I'm just saying the main way that um God speaks and God reveals himself
28:07
and so it could be an angel of Light if you're really having so many
28:14
like um experiences of physically seen so
28:21
much um especially if you struggle with angel of Light before then God's
28:27
definitely not going going to um come in that way that the angel of
28:32
Light was confusing in at least at first because that would be confusing to you and God is not a god of confusion so
28:39
God's going to reveal himself in the way of like of how through order like where
28:46
you're planted and where you're receiving teaching from so for example when I'm sharing like the main ways God
28:51
speaks through his word through his vassels through his servants through your spiritual leader those are the
28:57
going to the main ways that God is speaking to you um he's going to go with
29:04
that order he's not going to go against what he's instructing his servant to
29:09
teach so that's very important for you to understand so if you're finding things outside of what your leader is
29:17
teaching like in your life then that's really an indicator to humble yourself and um
29:25
realize that it could be just the enemy trying to bring
29:30
confusion so it's really quite simple if we humble ourselves and just adhere to
29:36
the teachings it says in the book of Acts that the um the people in the acts
29:41
Church they continually devoted themselves to the teachings of the Apostles they continually devoted
29:48
themselves to the teachings of the Apostles that's what it says in the book of Acts I don't have the exact scripture
29:54
right here but it's in one of the earlier chapters of Acts um um and so
30:00
God makes it quite simple continually devote yourself to the teachings of the
30:06
Apostles of your Apostle of your leader and that's that's what you need you know
30:12
you don't need you don't when things go outside of that that you're finding then you can know okay this probably is not
30:21
right amen what's the role of Elders so
Elder
30:28
I share this actually in my book The Secret of the anointing uh that scripture where it
30:34
shares how the elders were laying hands and people receiving gifts of the Spirit
30:40
so the real meaning of Elder is someone who is more experienced in the anointing
30:47
and anointed by God so it doesn't necessarily I mean today's time we tend
30:53
to think of it as older like an older believer in the
31:00
church a group of older Believers in the church that's how we tend to think of it like based on tradition in churches but
31:08
the real simple meaning is someone who has experience in their calling and in
31:14
the anointing so someone who is can be trusted uh someone who's had experience
31:21
and so in different seasons the church is going to look different as I share as I
31:27
as I've shared in the past how right now with God just God's Just Begun his end
31:35
time Revival he's just begun his great transformation and purification of the
31:40
body of Christ and so it's looking so much like it did in the be in the in the
31:47
very beginning in the of the acts Church where it was just the apostles first
31:52
sent out planting churches and then as time went on the other five full ministry
31:59
then CA prophets were there too but then the other fold ministers came along in
32:05
the church and so like here at fivefold church we're in the beginning
32:11
stages God is pioneering he is laying the foundation and since this is such
32:17
a since this is so new what God is doing the new wine is so different from the
32:22
old wine it takes longer it takes longer to build this Foundation um for you know
32:29
God didn't even want to God didn't want to entrust me to many people Beyond like
New Wine
32:37
15 or so people um until about 4 and a
32:43
half years after calling me to be an apostle so um like just for me it took
32:50
time to really get that new wine in me
32:55
and old wine out of me and bring me to the place where I'm I can be
33:02
trusted I can be trusted with with people to lead and that every teaching
33:09
it could be from really from the Holy Spirit and really pure new wine um and
33:14
so it's the same thing for all leaders who God raises up it's going to take
33:21
time it's going to take longer than tradition than
33:28
traditional ways of raising up leaders because we're going from old
33:34
wine to new wine it's going it takes more time and God really wants to make
33:40
sure that his church is pure and in order for it to be pure his vessels have
33:46
to be completely pure and completely ready um or else it's like an open door
33:52
for the enemy so it's a really serious deal that
Gods Timing
33:58
why we H we must go with God's timing so as time goes on at fivefold church there
34:04
will be other five-fold ministers that are there that are anointed by God and
34:09
will share in ministering um and so there will be other times where another minister is is
34:18
casting out demons is laying hands you know I uh like on a different Sunday
34:24
like if I'm not there for example um that's how it will be so there will be
34:30
Elders as time goes on but since we're in the beginning stages we can't have
34:35
everything in the beginning and that's okay it it can't happen like that and it doesn't mean that there's a lack it's
34:43
just the stage we are at right now Hallelujah when you build a house you
34:50
cannot have everything at once but you go step by step by step by step and once
34:57
the house is ready and lived in many times it takes time to get everything
35:02
decorated get all the Furnishings perfectly how you envisioned it right or
35:10
maybe now we need to do the Landscaping there's there's more to be done once
35:16
it's lived in and and doing its greatest purpose it's not about feeling as I just
Its Not About Feeling
35:22
shared um about the the two questions ago that
35:29
that receiving anointing from God receiving miracles from God is nothing about feeling sometimes there's a
35:34
physical feeling but many times there's not you can be a you can be a a rock in
35:42
water and not soak up the water but you can be and you can be a sponge and soak up the water and this is
35:52
having nothing to do with feeling but it's having everything to do with faith and so when you go to receive from God
35:58
you shouldn't be expecting I'm going to feel God today I'm going to feel a
36:03
physical something physical from God today I'm excited to feel something physical from God today we should never
36:09
have that kind of feeling if we feel something physical from God Rejoice that's exciting like that's That's so
36:16
exciting to have physical encounters I mean we are humans we are physical I
36:21
think I mean we love most of us love hugs I think most of us would I know I would I I think I would be really
36:28
awesome and amazing to um like physically feel something from God every
36:33
single day but that's not what we're called to and so we have to accept that we have
36:40
to accept God's ways so even though we'd like that um we
36:46
we got to make sure we're we're humble and obedient to God's ways not our ways
36:52
all right so when we are going to going to a place to encounter God our heart
36:57
should our heart posture should be I'm coming to receive from God spiritually now that's nothing to do with physically
37:03
spiritually has nothing to do with physically I mean we're connected to our pH you know our spirit soul and body are
37:10
one so yes there's a connection and if you're touched spiritually it's going to eventually at least touch you physically
37:17
for example if you have sickness in your body and God heals you spiritually it will eventually touch you physically
37:24
where you see I've been healed I feel differently now now in my body I feel healed right um if you are oppressed if
37:31
you feel anxious if you feel anxiety in your body um and you God delivers you of
37:39
a spirit of anxiety you will definitely eventually feel it physically right but
37:45
when we go to receive from God like at a Revival um event at the church at the
37:52
conference we should not go looking for a physical experience but a spiritual experience the understanding that most
37:59
time many times the spiritual experience isn't physical immediately but will be
38:05
eventually because we're all connected and God wants to bring whole health and
38:11
peace and joy which we will feel physically too amen so um but but but but God's dealing
38:18
with a root so um God is dealing with the
38:23
root uh and by the way I just want to I don't think I like asked this question
38:28
or spoke this question but the question was basically talking about what happens if you don't feel God you didn't feel
38:35
God when you went to um an event where God's power was moving but other people
38:41
were feeling but you don't feel what's wrong with you what's going on that's the question nothing's wrong with you so
38:50
um yeah as I was sharing um you you the the spiritual God's
38:56
dealing with the the root of the problem we're going to deal with the root of issues we're going to deal with the root
39:03
you go to the doctor to not deal with the root you go to counselors to not deal with the root you're dealing with
39:10
symptoms which can never remove but only the anointing Jesus can remove the root and that's
39:18
when the problem is completely removed where you don't even have to deal with the symptoms because the
39:24
symptoms themselves are gone because the Root's gone Hallelujah so when you are going to the church you are you should
39:31
be expectant for God to deal with the root of the problems in your life that which is spiritual and the spiritual is
39:39
the Unseen and unfelt like physically it's unseen realm it's not Physical
39:45
Realm it's spiritual just as Heaven exists but we
39:52
can't see it physically we don't see the Pearly Gates of Heaven like we don't see
39:57
it up in the sky but it's there 100% that's the spiritual realm right God's
40:04
here right now we're not hearing him audely we're not seeing him but he is here 100% so it's the same principle
40:10
when you go to encounter his power he's there 100% you're go you should you should have your heart in the posture of
40:16
I'm going there to receive from God in the spirit I'm going to to God's going to deal with my spirit
40:23
he's going to deal with my root here I could feel something I could not I don't care about the feeling I care about the
40:29
spiritual realm what God is doing in my life that's where our heart should be
Miracles Happen
40:35
and some people feel things some people some people don't but miracles happen to all people if they will have faith so it
40:43
can be a real problem when people don't have this spiritual knowledge I'm telling you because they're looking for
40:48
a physical experience they don't get the spir physical experience and they lose faith and they drop what God has
40:55
released to them so if that's you you can take hold of what God released to
41:00
you again say I believe I have received I receive those words that were declared I
41:06
do not take them lightly I believe that I have received spiritual change in my life by going where the anointing was I
41:16
take hold of it and I reject every lie of the devil that's saying otherwise I value what was released that
41:24
anointing that was released I value what God has done in my spiritual life the healing the freedom the change that has
41:30
taken place that I haven't seen yet but I believe it and I value it by declaring
41:35
those words you are taking hold of what God released to you and protecting it
41:41
and rejecting the devil's lies and you will see the
41:47
miracle manifest from spiritual unseen realm to physical you you will see it
41:55
you will see it Hallelujah so many times I mean with the
42:02
power of God I mean many lots of times there is physical manifestations because the anointing is
42:09
just so powerful that sometimes you know it's like you the physical
42:14
just can't help but experience it right there and then
42:20
too so many times you see people falling back power of God demons screaming out of people uh people shaking with of God
42:28
different things you'll see the physical manifestations of what's going on in the spirit but what's so important is to not
42:35
compare yourself and to not and not even to go expecting that go expecting to
42:40
receive from Jesus don't go expecting for physical encounters and it may happen it may not
42:46
it doesn't matter it a person that has a physical manifestation versus a person that doesn't but if they have faith They
42:53
will receive the same Miracle the same power of miracle
Surrender Everything
43:03
Hallelujah have to discern what season you're in and not compare yourself to
43:08
others well I mean Just Surrender everything to Jesus surrender everything
43:14
and keep your eyes on him and keep all doors shut to the enemy and just every
43:20
day surrender and God takes care of the
43:26
rest God leads God directs the steps of the righteous man and woman so you don't
43:32
need to worry about missing things um when God wants to change your direction
43:38
he will make it obvious he will he will speak to you and he will close the wrong doors
43:46
and open new ones that were not opening in a previous
43:52
season and so um if you have certain desires in your heart that maybe are
44:00
promises from God things he's things that you really believe are his promises
44:06
but you're not seeing them yet and maybe you're really Desiring them to come right
44:11
now give them to God surrender them to
44:17
God and just trust his timing um his one of the biggest things
44:24
I've learned these years of following God in my
44:30
calling in the anointing is that my timing is not God's timing that so often I want things to
44:37
happen sooner and so often I think things should happen
44:44
sooner God's timing is so different and there can be
44:52
this uncomfortable feeling in those times of waiting of
44:57
why isn't this happening did I miss [Music] something this is
45:05
frustrating but God's timing is perfect and if you're truly surrendered to
45:11
God and the thing isn't happening yet it's simply not God's
45:17
timing and that's it you don't need to worry you don't need
45:24
to try to open the door it's not time
45:30
yet um and and and God's timing is different for different people when you're seeing other
45:38
people be where you want to be but you're you're not there yet it's not timing
45:44
yet just may you see it as
45:49
an as an encouragement of God's faithfulness that God's done it for them
45:55
he'll do it for you renew your mind there rather than going to the comparison place or Envy
46:03
place but renew your mind that God loves you and his timing is perfect and his
46:11
promises will come to pass and just cuz you're not seeing them yet doesn't mean
46:16
they're not going to happen or he loves you less than other people who are seeing the promises be fulfilled no it's
46:24
just not his timing but the timing is
46:30
coming don't lose Faith the timing is the time is coming for God's promises to
46:37
be fulfilled choose to be content in every circumstance choose to be content in the
46:45
waiting amen how can I explain to my husband who is struggling to lose weit that this
46:51
could be spiritual he's doing so many things but hasn't seen results and stuck with the same weight so Josie testified
47:00
in the past and she ret testified briefly about this miracle like last
47:06
week I posted her testimony of ret testifying it of it but it's more brief
47:11
than the previous one so maybe if you can find the old one I'm not um maybe
47:17
you can search Apostle Katherine Crick um Supernatural weight loss like I
47:24
think the title was something like that but um um she she she received that
47:29
Miracle she tried all these things to lose weight and nothing worked and then
47:34
I declared one day prophetically that God was healing someone who couldn't lose
47:41
weight and they were going to lose weight the weight now supernaturally like God was doing the miracle and um
47:48
then the the weight just Shed off like so fast I mean gradually it wasn't like overnight but like quickly it Shed off
47:57
and so much so much shut off so anyways um just share that testimony with him
48:04
and um if he's open encourage him to position himself where the anointing is
48:09
and renounce not being able to lose weight you know even if I um it doesn't
48:16
even matter if if it's specifically declared or not um the Jesus in his
48:22
power knows the needs it does you don't have to wait for me to say some me to say something it's sometimes how God
48:29
moves but um position yourself for the anointing is renounce and God will move
48:36
and and knowing all the keys for deliverance too is important so you're not missing anything my friend wanted me
Spiritual Cleansing
48:42
to do spiritual cleansing prayers with her like prayers to cleanse your house Etc but I wanted to
48:47
ask uh you about it first is this okay or something to stay away from um the
48:53
most important thing to receive freedom in general uh it's it's it's really connected to the
48:59
the demonic spirits are are are interested in the person more than physical places so what's really
49:07
important is to make sure one is closing every door in their own lives and physical
49:14
objects that they have that demonic spirits could be attached to um like
49:22
witchcraft items uh demonic suai items what's
49:27
really important is to close every door in your own personal life renounce and
49:34
throw away every item in your house that could have a demonic Spirit attached to
49:40
it and position yourself where anointing is to be free from everything
49:45
so when you position yourself where the anointing is I mean if if the per if the
49:52
person is sensing like um
49:59
uh just like being in the house every time they're in the house they have nightmares or something like that things
50:05
like this renounce those things specifically but be where the anointing
50:10
is that's the important thing because it's the P the the important thing is
50:16
the power of God that destroys the yolks um and and and and so that's it's
50:23
simple sometimes people make it more complicated um than it needs to be but it's really
50:31
that simple so that's really the wisdom for the friend that they should focus on
Closing Doors
50:37
instead of focusing on the house focusing on their own spiritual life and physical items attached to their life
50:43
like that they have to get rid of them and position themselves where the anointing is because we are
50:52
um we are powerful in Christ like when we shut every door to the enemy demon have to leave our lives and so when we
50:59
come into a house when we come into a hotel room and we have the door shut to the enemy then we have we are
51:07
sanctifying that place just by our Authority in Christ as an anointed vessel being there um
51:16
demons can't stay in our presence
51:22
um in physical places they can't stay so but that's the really important part is
51:28
for us to have all of the door shut in our own lives and be powerful in Christ
51:34
be anointed in Christ that demons see us and see us as pure and full of anointing
51:42
and can't come near us that they can't come near us you know like you see you you see
51:52
um you see how demons like don't want to come near like when an
52:00
anointed Minister like if I'm ministering many times a demon really doesn't want to come close and it's like
52:06
fire that's how it should be for us when we go to places if we go to a hotel room if we go to a a house you know I don't
52:14
even have to say anything the demon is running you know when you have all door
52:20
shut to the devil and you are so full of anointing you are like fire you don't have to be worrying like is there any
52:27
demon in here go demons they're staying far away from you they're repelled from
52:32
you because of the fire you carry the anointing you carry if you really have the anointing which if you have door
52:39
shut to the enemy and you're surrendered to God and humble and you're planning where the anointing is that's how demons
52:45
see you you have the anointing in your life and they're repelled from you they're you're like they see you like
52:51
fire they don't want to stay in a hotel room with you they're out of there [Laughter]
52:59
and so people they don't they miss this Revelation they're like oh get out of here demons they're gone the moment you
53:07
show up the moment even before you start they're
53:12
gone hallelujah how do you know if you are really surrendered to God is surrender
Surrendering to God
53:20
something you do daily so the biggest thing is keeping
53:27
surrender in your heart this is a big this is a big part of having the fear of God this is also meaning having fear of
53:34
God like keeping surrender in your heart it's the awareness that God sees you and is with
53:40
you every moment of every day and he sees all that you're doing not in a scary way not in a oh he's watching me
53:49
what this is you know way no but you know you're are partnered
53:54
together to do his work in this world so like he's your
54:01
partners you know you you you you can't do anything without him and you want him
54:07
there and you're living your life with the awareness that he's there
54:13
and he sees and you're happy he sees cuz he helps you do everything he
54:20
needs to be there he needs to see to be able to help you and strengthen you when you need it
54:27
and correct you when you need it because the Bible says God corrects those he loves so you want him to be able to see
54:34
to correct you when you need it um and you want him to be able to see to
54:42
convict you to tell you like I want you to go this way instead of this way you
54:47
know um so that the transformation can come about in your life so that that you want
54:53
him he needs to be able to see so he can put put his hands on your heart and mold your heart too so you're more than okay with him
55:01
seeing every part and you're living in this awareness that he's seen every part of your life and
55:07
so you live your life not religiously you know not out of
Living your life
55:13
performance you live your life understanding God wants you to rest God wants you to um have time to
55:23
just like enjoy life as well do things that um refresh you as well you know
55:30
like and see that he he loves you he loves seeing you do that um you know for example I find if I
55:40
take a day to really just refresh I I find that it fills me with more energy
55:49
and joy to do his work rather [Music] than being bogged feeling heavy like
55:57
just working working working working working you know um and same for every
56:03
day like if like every day we should also take some time to
56:08
rest take some time to refresh so in those times knowing like he's happy for
56:14
you to do that he it's important right so anyways like every part of your life
56:19
you're you know you're having the awareness that he sees and you want him to see and you want to please him with
56:25
what you do you want him to be pleased and that's that's how your life
56:32
should look like people who aren't surrendered usually they compart compartmentalize their relationship with
56:39
God they turn it off like they turn off their awareness of God in certain
56:47
areas um it's like they they choose to just spend time with God sometimes
56:52
rather than every second of every day so surrender is spending is inviting God in
56:58
for every second of every day and with
57:04
intention pleasing looking to please him looking to serve
57:10
him with intention that's how you can know you're
57:16
surrendered and God will when that's your heart and your humble he will convict you like when you are being
57:23
super selfish in a certain area when you are trying to force something when you
57:28
have just your desire that's just you know is your desire not really God's
57:33
desire he'll convict you it it won't be hard to know he'll convict you you'll
57:40
know um and so if you will surrender that and
57:46
repent that means you're surrendered but if you're ignoring that
57:51
conviction if you're compartmental compartmentalizing your life with God
57:58
um living and then living your life that's not surrender is it okay to fast before
Fasting
58:05
going to flourish conference and if yes how should that be yeah that could be God's direction for some it's not for
58:11
all but it's it could be for some and I do you know when someone if someone has
58:19
uh a a severe demonic oppression complex demonic oppression
58:25
and God has an appointed time of Deliverance of going where God's power is then many times it is important for
58:34
that person to fast to deny their flesh to to
58:41
strengthen their Spirit man it's not a blanket direction for everybody for
58:46
everybody that needs Deliverance but when one is in severe demonic
58:52
oppression um that's that's definitely important
Cutting contact
58:57
when there was a lot of manipulation in one relationship is that okay to cut contact without explaining yes yes um there are some
59:06
people that really have wrong really bad evil
59:13
intentions towards people towards one and um if that's one's assignment I mean
59:22
one's I mean assignment from the enemy one
59:28
's motive then they're definitely not in
59:33
the place to receive to receive like
59:42
Ministry okay so um what I mean by that is that we don't have to be like
59:51
religious and feel like we have to be a nice Christian chti
59:56
always to everybody like that it looks cookie cutter showing love you know um when
1:00:04
there is like someone with really evil intentions and um doing just
1:00:12
being coming really from the enemy you know like really with this evil
1:00:19
intention and motive like towards you um you don't have to like feel
1:00:24
obligated to like give them this long conversation on the phone like you know I want to make sure
1:00:33
I'm being loving enough like as Christians sometimes it can be religious that we like think that we're not being
1:00:41
loving if we don't do something a certain way um so yeah so I want to just say be
1:00:49
free of that and there will be sometimes where it's like someone's coming really
1:00:55
really sent by the enemy and we still love them we love our enemies but loving our enemies doesn't
1:01:00
mean we we we treat them the same way we do as someone who God has assigned us to
1:01:06
pour into and like and and and talk to on the phone and like you know what I
1:01:12
mean it's it's loving our enemies can sometimes just simply meaning not not
1:01:18
going eye for eye and and not causing them harm in any way and not speaking
1:01:24
badly against them sometimes that's what loving your enemy means it doesn't loving your enemy doesn't mean that you
1:01:31
treat them exactly the same as you treat um someone God's called you specifically to like pour into you know no so yeah
1:01:40
loving because we're called to love everybody in this world but we obviously can't have like even conversations with
1:01:47
everyone in this world right but we still love them like we love them in the
1:01:52
in the way that we pray like that we pray for them and that we only speak life for them and that we choose to not
1:01:59
speak death or gossip that's love you know and so um yeah if there was a past
1:02:06
relationship where it was just really really bad motives and intentions towards you like you can tell like
1:02:12
really this person was just coming with nothing but bad intentions then sometimes it's actually wisdom to
1:02:19
just just like not respond just be quiet and not feeling like you like have to ow
1:02:25
and explanation of why now you know you're you're quiet and you're not in the person's life anymore should someone
1:02:33
with cancer do chemother chemotherapy even if knowing Jesus is the Healer yeah you know this is going to look different
1:02:39
for everybody this is just there's not oblate answer for this one it depends on
1:02:44
a lot of different things it just depends on what God wants to do it depends on a person's Faith sometimes their faith level because God can do
1:02:51
more when when um more faith is there there and so and then I mean people many
1:02:58
people they have chemotherapy and they are um they are they are cancer free you know and
1:03:07
but usually chemo does give like side effects and things but God can then if there were side effects that came God
1:03:13
can then heal them of that you know so definitely I would not say that any kind of treatment is just wrong and should
1:03:20
never be done um generally just in general meaning because

everything's different there's not a cookie cutter answer for this when it comes to god- Bringing healing there's
1:03:33
not a cookie cutter answer um so sometimes sometimes one may go
1:03:42
through some treatment and maybe the cancer like completely vanishes that God
1:03:49
does a miracle when the doctor expected it to shrink it instead completely vanished or
1:03:56
it shrinked quicker shrunk quicker than a doctor even ever saw and that can be a
1:04:04
way God does a miracle and even a testimony to a doctor there could be even a
1:04:09
purpose in that you know rather than someone's saying peace doctor I'll never see you again and the doctor just thinks the person like passes away from cancer
1:04:16
or something because it rejected treatment maybe God wants to shock this
1:04:22
doctor with you know I mean there's just different um things that God could have planned
1:04:28
and it's based on so many different things and sometimes it could be Faith sometimes someone is like I believe God
1:04:34
will heal me without this and so I'm resisting this and God is applauding that faith and he's proud of that person
1:04:40
you know I know like the woman that testified um recently like last month
1:04:47
like a few weeks uh Revival is now Atlanta I prayed for I prayed for her on
1:04:52
miracles on Zoom I believe it was yeah and she was in the hospital and she was
1:04:58
rejecting Kumo and they eventually sent her on hospice um and the cancer was metastatic
1:05:05
it spread all over her body and she actually rejected chemo and then as time went by it wasn't overnight But as time
1:05:12
went by the cancer was completely gone completely gone and the doctors were
1:05:17
shocked the doctors saw in the x-rays where did it go and she's completely healed she
1:05:23
testified about Revival is now at land so Hallelujah so that was what God
1:05:30
wanted and that's what and God was so proud of her faith and did that amazing Miracle amen but I'm not going to share
1:05:37
a Doctrine now like see because of this everyone should reject any kind of treatment any you know no it's that's
1:05:45
not what God is calling me to do and um it's just based on how there's not a cookie cutter answer and it depends on
1:05:53
one's Faith number as one factor factor and it also can just depend on how God
1:05:58
has planned to bring the healing sometimes in the midst of
1:06:06
treatment amen and by the way that's what I want to share with even medications and
1:06:11
things it's not a it's not a same kind of answer for everyone I want to speak
1:06:18
