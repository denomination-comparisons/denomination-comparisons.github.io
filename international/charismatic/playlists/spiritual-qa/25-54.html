0:01
brenley my wife and I are looking at buying a house but I'm not sure about it how can I know if God wants us to rent
0:06
or buy a house I first want to say I think this message might have been
0:12
shared preached before you came to the ministry maybe not but I'm it might have
0:18
been um but I preached a message called made in God's image um you can find that
0:25
on my YouTube if you search made in God's image I believe that's the title
0:31
um I believe that's the title I know there's definitely God's image in the title so if you search my name and God's
0:37
image but um I just first want to start off with go watch that message um this is one of
0:45
the areas where God is going to be leading you to make holy spirit-led
0:51
decisions um using wisdom so there's going to be a lot of decisions that come
0:57
up in life where we're like God what do you want me to do and many times the
1:04
answer isn't having to do with like God saying I want you to do
1:11
this but the answer is coming from God's God speaking to you I've given you
1:19
wisdom I want you to make this decision there's not a
1:24
terribly like wrong super wrong decision in this in this scenario
1:30
but there is a more wise decision so using wisdom that I've given
1:37
you you make this decision there's going to be a lot a lot of our decisions in
1:43
life are going to look like that where it's not like God's going to be speaking
1:49
in a dream or God's going to be speaking all of a sudden his word is going to pop out this the decision um but it's it
1:56
like we can be looking in that ways and God doesn't speak in that way he's speaking he's already spoken
2:01
through the wisdom he's he's given you and now he wants you to make the decision that's having to do with like
2:08
when um it's not this like one decision is is absolutely the like this is God's
2:15
Will and this is not there's a lot of things in life that it's not so much that way but it's more like it'd be more
2:20
wise to make this decision so this would be better but it's not like going with this decision is going to take you far
2:28
away from God's will so um you know it's like
2:35
how me when I um when I graduated from
2:40
college in in 2013 um I was at this place where I was
2:46
like Lord I just want to be in your will this is before complete surrender to God this is before I encountered God in
2:51
power this is before I fell in love with Jesus but even before I fell in love with Jesus I still wanted to be in his
2:58
will I still loved God and I wanted to be in his will I definitely had like um
3:03
you know selfish motives that I didn't I didn't have now once I was
3:09
surrendered but deep down even though there was selfish interests in there in
3:15
me deep down I wanted God's will so I would pray to God say Lord I just want to be in your will you know and there
3:23
wasn't this crazy like answer um I believed he was leading me to moved to
3:30
LA to pursue acting so I did that um but it wasn't some like big dream or
3:36
something I had there was a series of events um that I believe Holy Spirit was leading me in but um you know at that
3:43
point it definitely wasn't like I'm calling you to be an actress Catherine
3:48
go to La you know um but God was using um just like my passions and giftings at
3:56
that time to get me on the course in the city of where he was going to send a
4:02
prophet to prophesy to me um years later a few years later right but in God's
4:10
eyes it wasn't like she has to do acting in God's eyes it was like she can do
4:16
anything that gets around to La anything that's like that's Godly of course not
4:21
like sinful so um looking back I understand these things now and that's why I'm explaining to you and then once I moved
4:29
out to LA um things changed and I felt like I think God's calling me to pursue being a
4:35
Christian singer songwriter and so I started pursuing that and left the acting and um all through throughout
4:42
that I was looking for jobs um parttime jobs and through that I was definitely looking like God what do
4:48
you want me to do but looking back these jobs that I had it wasn't like God was
4:53
like I want you to do this waitressing job so that's what I did I first had a waitressing job then I had a different
4:59
waitressing job job um the first wasan job it was like um it was like a a
5:07
barbecue sports bar and so the The Vibes there weren't so classy is the great
5:12
best way to put it I guess so I with wisdom was like this is not working well I'm going to look for like a classier
5:20
restaurant and so I did and I worked at a different restaurant and um and then after that um I re it was like I was
5:29
serving alcohol one night it was more of like a party type thing and and then I I
5:34
was right after got B the Holy Spirit and I was like I can't work here I can't work here and that was definitely Holy Spirit like yes I don't want you to work
5:40
here anymore but it wasn't like God was like now I want you to Nanny but I
5:47
thought oh I like kids I'll let me try that so I started nannying um and doors just opened up
5:53
wildly with that so um and so so I just share all these little like side jobs I
5:58
had I also did Uber I also did lift and I did uh Postmates I drove for lift and
6:03
I drove for Postmates for a very short time like very on the side um and so anyways I just share all this with you
6:10
because in those moments I remember really being like God what do you want me to do and looking back it wasn't
6:16
really like God was like I want you to be this waitress at this restaurant I want you to Nanny
6:22
now God wanted me to be an apostle when the time came so there's certain times
6:28
when God's like I want you to be you need to be an apostle this is your my will for your life but then but but but
6:35
but but the years before that in terms of my job for example and even like
6:41
Apartments I'm living in and areas of town it it wasn't so much like God needed me to be here I lived in North
6:48
Hollywood for a little bit but looking back it's not like God had to have me live in North Hollywood I could live in
6:54
different I could have lived in different areas of La you know what I mean so um
7:00
so I just realized I didn't have my microphone here oh no well on YouTube the audio won't be
7:08
the greatest in the beginning but that's okay we still have some some sort of audio I have this here so that for the
7:14
YouTube recording um so I just share all of I just share all of that example for you
7:22
to know like sometimes we can be so um so like in in anxiety almost like
7:31
what's God's will I don't know what God's speaking and I don't want to make the wrong decision and we don't need to be that
7:38
way like you know we're stressing ourselves out like trying to hear God's voice speaking something so clearly when
7:44
actually he's not going to come speaking so clearly in certain situations he's going to come um I mean he's coming in
7:51
in in the still Small Voice guiding you with wisdom with wisdom um and so like
7:58
for me me um you know I was at that place at the restaurant where I was
8:04
like I I can't be in this kind of environment anymore I want more of a pure environment um also I like I like
8:12
children um so since I like children I want to be more in a more of a pure
8:17
environment um you know and I'm going to be alone with the children so I won't have like
8:24
uh outside influences I can't control for this season that will be really good in this new season that I was just
8:30
baptizing the Holy Spirit you know um not saying you should look for jobs
8:35
where you're not interacting with people I don't mean that but like where I was at that place in that season um I was I
8:41
I was like this would be a a good choice so I I went for it you know um
8:48
so you know take my example for areas in your life when it comes to
8:53
finances you know um you know I've mentioned myself like I've mentioned
9:01
how you know I used to be in a place of such a a a lack I mean it was a season
9:08
just before the promised land and this is one of the ways that God stretched my faith where you know I just I never
9:15
would think about ordering dessert or anything or ordering anything but a water like for years like I just
9:21
lived very frugal and any kind of clothing I just go right to the sales
9:27
area you know for years like that's how I lived um because of the season I was in you
9:35
know and then then as God opened doors and brought Revival I'm not in that place of lack and now 3 years into like
9:45
the promised land where God has brought Revival I could be in a place right now where I bought a house or I or I got a
9:54
bigger place I I cannot wait to have a backyard even a very small back yard cuz
9:59
I don't even have like a balcony right now and like one of my biggest passions is to just be outside and I praise God
10:05
that most days when I'm home I I go for a walk or I go for a hike um but I can't
10:11
wait just to like be able to be by myself outside and just and spend time
10:17
with God outside and just enjoy the fresh air and the Sunshine and I haven't
10:23
had that basically for I'm used to that like actually I'm so excited um next week I'm going to my hometown in Upstate
10:31
New York um for my niece's graduation it's my first time seeing my family from New York not my parents I've see my
10:37
parents a bunch because they've come and traveled here and come to Revival events but it's my first time being in the home
10:43
I grew up in since middle school 8th grade and seen other extended family like my sister my brother my niece and
10:49
nephews my aunt um my grandma um it's my first time seeing them being there in
10:55
Upstate New York where I grew up since right before the Revival broke out out since like it was January
11:02
2021 um so it's really going to be so nostalgic to go back so like wow the
11:08
last time I was here the last time I was here I remember it was early January and the videos had just gone viral so I
11:14
remember being home and being like I mean in my hometown and just like looking at the videos in awe and just
11:21
like wow God what are you going to do next but um and that was 2 months before
11:28
um the first demon manifest and was cast out anyways one of the things I'm the most excited about when I go to my
11:34
hometown is just going in the backyard and just being there so anyways like I
11:42
can't wait for that I've lived in La now for it'll be 11 years in November
11:47
without having that and like being able to go outside on my own and have some fresh air just like in the backyard or
11:54
something you know so I just share all that to say of like um I could be in a
11:59
place to get a house right now you know but I'm I I use wisdom with what with
12:06
what God is showing me like now is not the season like that
12:12
would like now's the season to especially right now like in the season we are in the Revival the season we are
12:18
in the ministry now is the season to like not really spend anything hard like
12:25
on yourself like I don't I don't spend the only I really spend money on for myself for the most part is like clothes
12:32
for Ministry and um that's pretty much it and then like
12:37
once in a while um like once a week I one day per week like we go to John tal
12:43
and I go to the gardens some time which is like a small fee you know just something like on a on a rest day to do
12:50
something but that's like all that I spend really money on and on myself now
12:57
we can I'm not saying like you should never spend any kind of money on yourself you shouldn't treat yourself to a vacation you shouldn't buy yourself a
13:04
nice TV or a nice house or car I'm not saying that like I know there will be a season where I can buy a nice house for
13:12
myself you know I know there will be a season where I can buy myself a nice
13:17
vacation or something you know um but I'm just sensitive to the the seasons oh
13:24
here's another one like you know of course the religious spirit hates to see like ministers like dressing well or
13:32
having designer stuff and I've never bought myself a designer bag I've had a
13:39
couple spiritual daughters gift me um like like three designer bags total um
13:46
God bless them God bless you uh but I've had so many people like so much hate like you're using offerings and spending
13:55
on designer bags look I see it in the picture but like I I have not spent money on
14:01
myself in designer places at all that's okay to do that's totally okay to do and in the future I may do that but in this
14:08
season I'm just sensitive like there's especially now with the season God's
14:14
taken us with um a higher standard we are in um theaters every week which cost
14:21
about $112,000 every week at fful church and um we are doing flourish conferences
14:28
which one conf coming up in Germany the venue alone is um
14:36
$125,000 and that's before the add-ons of the production um and we have three flourish
14:44
conferences coming up in one month and so me we're all called to sacrifice right now whoever's part of this move of
14:51
God I'm called to sacrifice so I don't spend money on myself at all except for
14:56
like clothes for Ministry but still then it's not like like expensive clothes um I'm I'm sewing everything into the
15:04
venues into everything I I don't like take money for myself at all pretty much
15:09
in this season um so like but that's that's wisdom it's not like God spoke to
15:15
me in a dream like don't spend any money on yourself right now don't go and get a
15:21
house right now or something like that no but I know like I use wisdom and even
15:27
like Consulting like talking with my spiritual father I use wisdom where I don't even know this isn't the time to
15:33
ask God for a house right now this isn't time to go searching for a house right now this isn't time for me to go buy
15:38
myself a house right now for me personally like it's I just know that with um wisdom with wisdom um just
15:46
knowing what God's doing now and what he's speaking and how he's speaking how he wants me and all of us to sacrifice
15:53
and to sew into the move of God more than ever um especially now is we're
15:59
we're still in that breaking ground season and they'll come a time where it's just abundance upon abundance upon
16:07
abundance in the area of finances and everything but we're um still in the the
16:13
breaking ground season we're still in the season where God is is is is H we're
16:18
still in the place where we haven't reached where we're going yet we haven't reached we're on the edge of the
16:24
promised land kind of thing we need we still have a little ways to go go
16:30
Hallelujah um so so yeah I just share that financially like a financial wisdom
16:37
with you based on the season you're in um so there might be like it's not over
16:43
complicated sometimes like if money is tight but you know you have this big
16:49
desire and dream you feel like God's put on your heart to get a car get a house
16:54
or go you know something like this sometimes that that Des in your heart
16:59
from God it's it's meant for another season it's not meant for right now and
17:04
so sometimes people get themselves in trouble financially because they didn't count the
17:10
cost they it's true they really did feel from God hear from God like I want you to do this I want you to move to this
17:17
city I want you to um get this thing that's going to cost tons of money and sometimes people
17:24
confuse like Faith like they think it's just like like they don't have any money but they just do it
17:31
and like God's going to show up there's a time for that but most times it is
17:37
important we count the cost because I I've Just Seen many examples
17:42
of people like rushing things um and not
17:47
having the money and then they end up bringing burden to others um you know
17:53
cuz they don't know what to do and that's a that's that's an example when that's that's like a an Evidence of like
18:00
okay this was Rush there wasn't counting of the cost right because we shouldn't like bring our uh our financial burden
18:07
to others if others want to help out of the kindness of their heart that's great but when we find ourselves um you know
18:14
there's nothing here I have to go like burden someone that's that's that's one
18:20
of those signs where you know you can realize in hind say oh I was supposed to count the cost more it I might have
18:26
rushed this so just sharing that with you I know probably most of us have done
18:32
that we've rushed things um and we've been like I'm just believing God for the provision there's a time for that yes
18:39
but sometimes we do rush things um and it's like we're like forcing the hand of God to bring us provision what like the
18:46
the season and timing is actually later that God's going to bring the timing and vision we confuse the seasons and we think I know God wants this for me so
18:52
I'm going down and God's like whoa hold up you got to wait on me you got to
18:57
count the cost got to make a wise decision so wisdom is very important um
19:04
counting the cost is very important so um yeah I just share that
19:10
to to for just just sharing that wisdom for you to apply in your own life um I
19:15
answered this question just seeing that this was not not your specific question to answer you brendley like this is what you should do but I saw that this
19:22
question applied in the area of wisdom um and like looking at your finances right now and and um just walking in
19:30
wisdom and I know that I I Holy Spirit led me to ask this question I mean
19:36
answer this question because I know it was going to help a lot of you a former leader of mine has been diagnosed with
19:42
cancer it left and came back with vengeance can I send a video even if they haven't received in the past I'm trying to see if this is Jesus
19:49
leading okay so it's from what I understand it sounds like you have shared with this former leader about the
19:56
the Revival that God is doing the anointing his power that's available to heal and deliver but they haven't been
20:01
receptive to it they've they have they they've rejected it they didn't want to hear it I think that's what I'm
20:08
gathering um just be just be gentle I mean you can
20:15
you can share I heard what happened I'm praying for you and I know God's power
20:20
is available to heal you by your by his stripes you are healed you could say
20:27
something like that depending on how rejecting they were you know like if they were like I don't want to see this video from Apostle cath or 5f church you
20:34
know then don't I wouldn't send the video you know to respect their Free Will and to not be pushy but um to
20:41
rather just respond in love meet them where they're at um and just know that like you've already planted the seed so
20:48
when they see you say like I'm praying for you they they'll remember oh you
20:54
know Crystal had shared with me about the power of God and I didn't receive it before maybe I should go look
21:00
again they'll remember so it's up to them how are you able to grow and mature
21:06
to be a spiritual leader between the time you received the prophecy you were called as an apostle and the time you started the church so from my calling is
21:14
unique my calling is very unique like it's not everyone else's calling my
21:19
calling as an as an apostle isn't the same as other people's callings as an apostle um like other people may receive
21:27
the prophecy their called to be an apostle but it might not be time for
21:33
them to start leading a church or you know preaching on a platform it could be for
21:39
years down the line maybe just depending you know but for me I received the prophecy I was called to be an apostle
21:46
and then God called me to start the church nine months later that was very very fast but it it it was just
21:53
particular to or specific to my calling um
21:59
you know as God's called me to Pioneer this this what God's doing and
22:07
um like be one of the first in this move so there was an urgency to start
22:16
quickly whereas if there if it if there was already someone like in my calling
22:23
and then I was an apostle not in my calling if that makes sense then this person who had already
22:29
started God would call me to really like sit under for a while probably for example um but my calling was very um
22:39
unique but at the same time you know God specifically didn't bring people to the
22:45
church more than 20 about at one time for three and a half years so
22:52
um God was uh preparing me even a even as I began to start but he was purposely
22:58
not bringing people not just well for two reasons for one um because I wasn't
23:05
ready to handle that kind of leadership and as a shepherd and the spiritual
23:10
attacks to come with it at that point and then um number two it was my refining season my uh Wilderness season
23:19
um but anyways I did grow so much in those nine months before and then continued to grow but so much thanks to
23:26
my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy he is a prophet of prophets he is a
23:32
highlevel prophet um and he's been uh a servant of
23:38
God a prophet and leader of his church of thousands
23:44
for um about 40 years more than 40 years um and
23:54
so he I had teaching from him and equipping from him
24:01
constantly um and correction from him guidance from him through those nine
24:07
months and then continuing so it's like um it's instead of going through
24:13
the usual schooling it's like I had
24:19
the teacher of teachers teacher of teachers like
24:25
professor of professors um day byday close close
24:31
teaching you know other others are sitting back listening but I you know this was like oneon-one so there was
24:38
this uh this this speed that God brought to my growth through
24:45
that and the anointing the anointing can do anything so the anointing with obedience with obedience the anointing
24:52
can really brought such a speedy transformation and growth and in take of
24:59
the new wine and knowledge of God in his
25:05
kingdom but the obedience was key The Obedience was really
25:10
key God can do anything with your obedience humility and
25:17
obedience how should we handle tithing in marriage when we are unequally yolked and have different ideas so this will
25:23
just depend on the situation um I know probably agreements with money
25:28
is different with finances is different in marriages like some marriages maybe
25:34
you know you each H you have maybe one joint account and then you have separate
25:40
accounts and you're you know you there's Independence you you don't have to
25:46
report everything that you're spending money on type thing you know but might not be that way
25:52
in other cases other cases maybe it's only just one joint account and
25:58
um there's a lot of oversight of you know spending so it it's really going to
26:03
depend on the situation but the best thing to do is to just talk to the
26:09
spouse you know like if you feel passionate about um giving somewhere
26:14
like to a church say you know just talk peacefully and from your
26:21
heart just share you know for example this church has blessed me so much I
26:27
want to give back and also the Bible says we should tithe and I want to tithe here and maybe I want to give more than
26:33
just 10% because I've been blessed so much here and also it is good ground to
26:38
reap from and um so I wanted to share that with you you know and have your
26:44
blessing upon that you know just to speak in a peaceful way um and in in
26:50
most situations hopefully the husb the spouse would understand but in some
26:55
situations maybe not some situations with spiritual warfare that might not be the casee but the best
27:01
thing you to do is to be open and honest and then declare and believe for God's
27:07
grace for God's grace over the situation and also know that God's grace
27:13
is upon you like if there's some reason you're you're like blocked [Music]
27:18
from giving the way you want to give for example um but you really want to give
27:25
but you're being blocked like maybe it's it's a spouse for example um what you
27:32
shouldn't do is let that get you down let that cause you to think that you are
27:40
missing out so much because you're not able to sew the way you want um be
27:45
bitter no like if you are blocked just do your part of taking it to God
27:51
declaring using your Authority in Christ declaring and um you've done all you can
27:58
so now just rest and trust that God is going to come through and move the mountain but what you shouldn't do is
28:06
what what nobody should do is become so Disturbed and uh distraught over a situation out
28:14
of your hands you know um there's spiritual components to many things of why there's this mountain here but what
28:20
we must do is believe in God use our Authority in Christ and just rest
28:27
because that's all we can do that's all we that's all we can do when you've done
28:33
your part you're wasting time worrying you're wasting your time um being distraught
28:40
and that is making you go the opposite the wrong way I mean it's making you put
28:45
your eyes off of Jesus and everything that's good which is making you less spiritual which is opening up doors to the enemy uh so this is how we should
28:54
live is do what we can take it to God surrender declare use our Authority and
29:01
then rest do not let it get us down do not let it get you down in the season of waiting for the mountain to move trust
29:08
that it will move and and you've done your part God's grace is covering
29:14
you if my spouse doesn't tithe yet should I tithe for both of us if they're
29:20
okay with that yeah that's I mean you're one so because you're one anything you're
29:26
doing for God including giving is going to have an effect a positive effect on
29:33
your spouse they have free will but even if like even if they they're far from god
29:39
let's say but there is a special Grace coming upon
29:46
them um like if the enemy is trying so hard he's blocked in many areas to
29:54
really penetrate the way he's trying to grab them for example so even some of you that might not see
30:00
much change in your spouse you know maybe they're far from
30:05
God you you need to you need to understand like there's so much more grace here than you know it could be so
30:12
much worse God's grace is working he's protecting he's moving there are seeds
30:19
planted because of what you're doing because of you giving your life to God because of you surrendering in every
30:26
area so yeah so if if the husband's okay with
30:31
you know you tithing more and in your heart you're like this is for him then
30:37
that that's more grace extending to him it is in the spiritual realm having an
30:43
effect it's not like the same as if he personally is choosing to tithe that
30:48
would have greater power in his life the The Reaping that comes from that but there still is a a great power if you
30:57
were to like SE on his behalf you know more grace coming to him
31:03
in that area too of of his eyes opening up the power of sewing so that he would
31:09
choose to just choose to tithe himself and part of that will come when he sees
31:14
changes and miracles happen and you share spiritual principles about tithing
31:19
this is the reaping how should we handle disrespectful and arguing from teenagers and also not drain the
31:26
anointing well I think I I shared one time like what what can drain the anointing is is
31:33
stress and [Music] um that's speaking especially for
31:39
ministers we all carry anointing so it applies to everybody but when I spoke that word about the anointing being
31:46
drained it was so much speaking about ministers and how we should be careful
31:51
not to cause stress and do things to drain the anointing that we are
31:56
receiving from by by bringing stress you know
32:02
um so now I want to share though with with this question how should we handle disrespectful and arguing for teenagers
32:07
and also not drain the anointing so um we all have trials we all and and and
32:15
when the more we surrender actually I see I've seen a pattern like I've seen
32:21
many people they moved to LA and um to be part of 5f and I've seen just like
32:27
attesting once they come and God allowing a refining fire to take place
32:33
and it's like it's it's like the devil is mad that they've come so so strongly in the will of God um he
32:42
knows the power of that the power of being obedient when God's asking you to to do such a thing to make such a
32:49
sacrifice um and so the enemy can bring attack to try to discourage to try to
32:55
distract and because you've gone because you've made that decision
33:00
to be in God's will so firmly and like make a sacrifice for example like moving
33:08
um you you you've gone you're going You're gone to the next level God is
33:14
bringing you to the next level through this but new levels new devils and before God can promote you he has to
33:21
test you you have to pass the test yet to go to the next level so it's like the enemy doesn't want you
33:27
to go to the next level so the enemy will bring attack but then God uses that attack as the testing for you to pass and go to the
33:36
next level so um I mean yeah like when I
33:41
first um stepped in when I received the calling to be an apostle and I stepped into this
33:47
calling almost almost pretty quickly on then
33:53
there became such a financial burden like never before with the church and the church was small and and um I've
33:58
never like cried over not having money before in my life like I had lived in La at that point for a few
34:04
years and I was living I was um just sharing it was a two-bedroom two-bedroom
34:10
apartment in North Hollywood and I shared one room with another girl a small room so I paid $500 a month and
34:16
shared a room with another girl and I had a had part-time jobs of like
34:21
waitressing and um and my parents would help they would send money and help um
34:28
but I would cover like my rent and they would send more for like bills and like
34:33
food for example um but in that time you know as I had my parents and help and everything
34:39
even though I was living so frugally during that time um I wasn't stressing hardcore about money I was living
34:44
paycheck to paycheck but I wasn't like stressing and um like crying and
34:50
distraught but then once the church came I remember I I think I've shared this testimony before like one time I was
34:56
nannying at this point we had the church and so there was just so much more expenses and I I I I mean as I shared my parents
35:03
were retired teachers my dad paints houses as well after he retired but so
35:09
their retirement checks are like not much as a teacher and um and so like for
35:16
me to ask them for money like they were happy to give if they had it but it became
35:22
like like going into savings and stuff you know for them to to send money so it
35:29
was then I hated asking you know but I didn't know what else to do and so I remember just crying a lot over money
35:36
like just like I mean over not having money over not like weekly at being the
35:43
stressful thing um so uh I I
35:49
never face anything so difficult where it was just I felt like this burden and I was just crying over it and I wasn't
35:55
someone who like cried a lot but I would be on the phone crying with my mom and I never like cried with my mom before like
36:02
that and almost not like fighting but I was just like Mom please I don't know what to do you know and I never had that
36:08
you know went through that before and I just say all that to say is like is to to to share with you like part of the
36:14
refining fire I went through even before um I facing such well before and after
36:21
facing actually such brutal uh betrayals
36:28
and people spreading lies and the church dwindling down from people beli in the
36:33
lies and stuff like that um so this was a big part of my refining fire like God allowed that like God allowed that like
36:42
struggle for me to go through um because he wanted to refine me and you know in
36:47
my in his eyes I was so important to him you know and so of course he wouldn't
36:52
want me to struggle with money you know but but he he wanted me to go through something hard he wanted me to go
36:59
through something that really was going to stretch my faith and and cause me to
37:04
lean on him more and grow in my faith and see him come through you know so
37:10
um that you know every time that you're going to the next level there is a there's a testing
37:17
that's feeling like a struggle so I share this to say like I've gone through
37:23
these stressful experiences in my past but it wasn't like something to be worried about like oh no this is like
37:31
stress oh no I'm not going to be as anointed like you got to understand that
37:37
some things God allows to stretch you so you don't need to be worried like oh no
37:44
this is going to disturb my peace and this is going to make the anointing not flow through me as much like you have to
37:51
be aware God's allowing certain things many times for your good so um sometimes
37:57
these things don't feel good and you're not going to naturally feel like so full of joy and so full of the
38:05
anointing but it doesn't mean that like God can't use you still God can't use you just as powerfully still so you got
38:12
to recognize you know when the storms come God's allowing them we don't need to worry about the storms we don't need
38:19
to worry about how the storms may like affect our peace or something we just
38:25
have to recognize it for what it is is this is my refining fire this is my testing and so my job is to pass this
38:33
test my job is to respond in a way that's pleasing to God to be obedient my job is to keep my peace like my feelings
38:42
do not feel peaceful but I'm going to choose to remain in peace I'm going to choose to not let my feelings dictate me
38:48
dictate my future dictate what comes out of my mouth and how I act and how I
38:54
respond that's your job and so just you know storms will come and of course
38:59
you're going to feel not peaceful inside it doesn't mean you don't have peace when you don't have when you let the
39:05
devil seal your peace is when you act on the emotions is when you speak what you
39:10
feel so of course turbulence is not going to feel good you know you can't be
39:16
thinking oh no I'm losing the anointing and because I feel I feel feelings of
39:23
fear no that's not an indicator You've Lost Your Peace this is an indicator you
39:28
need to protect your peace right now take it seriously reject the lies of the devil speak Words of Life speak the
39:34
words that God wants you to speak to overcome this battle to pass this test and in that situation you've you've
39:41
you've kept your peace you've held on to your peace amen so yeah I know this
39:47
question was about like you know you know that's your daily life your daily life you you have teenagers at home and
39:54
you know teenagers are teenagers so there's going to be things that happen there's going to be arguments sometimes right so you know
40:01
just just recognize like this is life right now this is temporary they are teenagers it's okay the new wine here in
40:08
my family is really new not everyone's completely surrendered this is the
40:14
situation but this is the situation that God's allowed to happen in my life
40:19
there's nothing to fret about nothing to worry about nothing I need I don't need to fight this situation I need to
40:24
recognize this is part of my refining fire and I'm I'm going to focus on doing the best job I can with being obedient
40:31
to God and and responding to these situations how he wants me to
40:36
respond amen amen should we pay off debt before
40:44
making an offering well we should see well okay so the way to get out of
40:49
poverty we should see tithing and sewing as this is this
40:55
is how we be this is how we are free from poverty this is how we get out of
41:00
lack to reap you must so and remember the woman who had hardly any um she had
41:08
she just had just a few coins left and she gave that offering and Jesus Jesus prais was so happy about this wow you
41:16
gave more than these millionaires these rich people who gave is basically to summarize that um that the scripture so
41:26
um one of the revelations we can grab from that passage is that you know even
41:32
though this woman had so little God wasn't like okay well we only have a few and we have millionaires here giving so
41:37
or wealthy people giving so don't worry about giving you worry about feeding yourself you know you worry about taking this few coins you have and getting
41:44
yourself something to eat he doesn't say that and one of the reasons is it's this principle of seeking first the kingdom
41:51
of God and all these things will be added um is is is believing in the the
41:57
power of sewing when you sew then you will reap and so the principle of sewing is when you sew into the kingdom of God
42:02
God's true Kingdom like a Ministry where God's power is really moving uh your seed becomes so Supernatural when you
42:08
plant it into that ground it's like you bring your your seed that's like physical but like when you put it in the
42:14
ground it becomes Supernatural seed and so instead of sprouting out something that's much greater than a seed um a
42:20
plant it's like a supernatural plant like so this little seed that wasn't
42:25
Supernatural now comes out the ground this Supernatural plant that's how it is
42:31
when we sew and we see this happen in every area of our life Supernatural provision comes uh Supernatural
42:38
everything needs that you have in your life physical spiritual happens as we so
42:44
uh this is how we a big way we access the Kingdom of Heaven We access the
42:50
supernatural in our lives covering every part of our Lives is by sewing and definitely for provision so like when
42:58
you are serious about sewing what happens is Supernatural doors and favor
43:04
Supernatural doors open in your life and favor comes upon you so this can look like this can look like maybe you're
43:12
just an average person with not that great of a resume I mean average person
43:17
like average in abilities and skills and schooling right um and so
43:24
like everyone most people with your kind of resume and experience and giftings would only have this type of job that
43:31
only pays like this much and it's not very much but because you're serious about sewing you've sewed into the God's
43:38
kingdom when you knock on doors that are higher higher than this level this lower
43:45
level there's a supernatural favor upon you where doors open and it doesn't make
43:51
sense for your skills and your or how you see yourself skill-wise and your resume your experience but you'll find
44:00
people being like I don't know why but I just felt moved to hire you um so that
44:05
kind of thing that kind or or maybe if it's you have a business and your business is just
44:11
like I mean like let's okay let's just say it's like a clothing business or a
44:17
restaurant business there's millions of those businesses right so it's like a lot of competition so like most of these
44:22
businesses would just only be at this level right because there's just so much competition right but because you're
44:28
sewing into the kingdom of God then Supernatural doors are going to open now and there's going to be Supernatural
44:33
favor upon you so now clients start coming out of the woodwork and just like
44:40
they feel like there's a spotlight on your business for some reason like the way people are attracted to it and the way they're they're spending or what
44:47
have you Supernatural Supernatural provision coming because you seed so it's very
44:54
important you keep that um you you you understand say that principle because
45:00
what we should be living supernaturally we should be living with Supernatural resources Supernatural provision we
45:05
don't want to do it our own way the world's way of having success financially we want to do it God's way
45:13
right so when you understand this principle you will see how it's so important like it's just as important as
45:20
like eating you know like um so let's think about it this way if you have so
45:26
technically credit cards is debt so if you have um if you have like a few thousand
45:32
dollar in debt of a credit card but you're able to pay it but you still have to pay interest so obviously it's ideal
45:38
to like pay it all off but currently you don't have the finances to pay it all off so you'll have that debt but you'll
45:44
pay it off little by little and have the interest and all that but when you're doing that like when you're doing that
45:50
you still got to eat right so you don't like pay off your debt before you eat
45:55
right because eting such a priority like it's the source of life like you will
46:00
die if you don't eat and so we should see tithing and sewing into the kingdom as we are cutting off our Supernatural
46:08
resources if we don't sew and um you know God gives in many different ways in
46:14
every spiritual blessing like when you come position position yourself here to receive the anointing when you come in
46:20
person to church or an event a Revival event you're position yourself to just really receive like you don't have to do
46:26
anything just show up and God releases to you he releases miracles to you he releases Supernatural provision and
46:33
finances to you just freely freely because he loves you you are his child
46:38
when you give your life to God there's just this free inheritance that he gives you free you don't have to pay
46:43
anything but there's different ways of receiving all that he has for you so one of the ways is to just show up to
46:50
sacrifice and attend a live service attend an in-person service sacrifice
46:56
other things that you could be doing and position yourself and listen and receive and come with faith that's one of the
47:02
ways that God releases but then God has another way of releasing and that's through through sewing so it's just
47:08
important for us as children of God to to understand like God wants to released to me and I need his blessings I need
47:15
his Supernatural blessings I need his Supernatural protection I need everything Supernatural from the kingdom
47:20
of heaven that he has planned to give me I don't want to be missing out on even a percentage of that so I want to make
47:26
sure I'm doing everything on my part to position myself to receive it's all about positioning yourself to receive
47:32
whether it's showing up on the live coming in person CH to church service for example um surrendering everything
47:38
keeping every door shut so nothing's blocking you from receiving God's blessings and sewing like these are all
47:45
the different ways that you're positioning yourself to receive all that God has planned to give you so God has God's planning to give you all these
47:51
different things but we have to be wise and understand his principles of the different ways that he releases these
47:58
things these blessings these Supernatural blessings resources so um you know you should see
48:06
the importance of tithing of sewing as like the importance of eating you know
48:12
so that's what I have to say in terms of like uh paying off debt because you know some people are imagine that would be
48:18
like not tithing for like decades for some people because oh I have to pay off my debt first you know and you're missing out on the big way of receiving
48:26
and actually getting Supernatural provision to get you out of debt quicker I've been tithing and sacrificially
48:31
giving with a grateful heart however I'm still financially struggling is it a season of refining or demonic issue so
48:39
um it really just it really just depends on the situation I'm just going to answer this question generally for those
48:45
for many people who have who are going through this um you
48:52
know for me I was a very unique situation where when I was struggling
48:57
financially I was working part-time and then and then there was a shifting where
49:04
God spoke to my parents and said that they were going to support me fully
49:10
financially um so that um I could be doing starting the CH
49:17
doing the church full time doing Ministry full- time and that was then after thei the
49:24
great financial struggle it was before then before God had spoke to them that there was such a real like like
49:30
Financial struggle so much um so anyways in that period for me the answer was not
49:36
to go like find a like a higher a higher paying job to try to find the money in
49:43
that way that wasn't the answer for me because of my specific calling because God had already spoke through a prophet saying you're called to be an apostle
49:49
God had already spoken you're called to start a church and this was very important not just any church but this
49:55
was very important work and so God needed to then take me in a time after I
50:00
had been working for many years he had now spoken okay now this is the time I want you to focus completely on Ministry
50:07
and I didn't have a team I did I was doing everything all social media all graphic design um all
50:15
editing all the messages everything so I I I God needed
50:21
me to be I didn't have a team that could do other things I had to do everything and so that's why God
50:27
in that season had me not work but he but he had my parents he spoke to my
50:33
parents and my parents out of their heart said God is telling us to uh
50:38
provide for you financially I didn't go say Mom and Dad I feel like not working at all because I need to do all this
50:44
work can you just fund me completely I didn't go and be like a burden to my parents like that you know so um mine is
50:52
a very very unique situation so but for most people for most people if you're
50:57
finding yourself struggling financially um but you are sewing like you're doing everything right that God
51:05
is speaking like the principles of how to get out of financial lack for most people the answer is
51:15
wisdom use wisdom so the supernatural blessings that God
51:21
releases does not come from money falling from the sky it comes from knocking on the door
51:28
and the door opens seek ask seek and knock and then the
51:35
door will be opened so um if you find yourself like
51:41
the job you currently have is not paying the bills is not getting the bills
51:47
paid the answer for most people is wisdom use
51:53
wisdom you need to find a better pain job to cover the bills or if you're
52:00
living in a place that's too expensive maybe try to find a place that's less expensive for example just simply use
52:07
wisdom so um you know if you're finding the job is not paying the bills then you
52:14
need to believe you need to trust God that there is a higher paying job out there for you and that God will give you
52:20
favor because you need to understand God God can take you through Seasons where it's like paycheck to paycheck because
52:26
it's it's a refining fire like how it was for me but that will be a season for God
52:33
doesn't want people to struggle beyond the refining fire moments that God sometimes brings God wants you to live
52:40
in abundance God wants you to be a blesser and not a a a lender and not a
52:47
borrower the Bible says so um believe that God will open up doors
52:54
if you knock on them they will open so search use wisdom you know make effort
53:00
and search for higher paying jobs use wisdom like this is how much everything costs so this is how much of this is how
53:07
much I would need to be paid or I would need to have another job another part-time job to get all of this being
53:13
paid and then start to knock on the doors and Trust believe that there is Supernatural favor upon you that's
53:20
what's very important to understand is many people they sew and they're expecting money to fall from the sky or they open the door and money will just
53:26
show up on their doorstep that's not how it works it works through you knocking
53:31
on the door and you working the Bible says I'm just paraphrasing it but like
53:39
if you don't work you won't eat like if you don't when you when you work you have to like we have to work we were
53:44
made to work amen so um it's important we we realize the importance of this in
53:52
terms of this is how God Is providing this is how God Is providing more
53:57
and you have to use wisdom too A lot of people they are they are for lack of better words lazy they they they they
54:05
want a particular job because a lot of jobs are not fun that's just how it is but that's part of our refining fire
54:12
that's part of the what God takes us through is doing jobs that aren't fun but they pay the bills until God opens
54:19
doors in the right timing to release the a job a career that we will enjoy that
54:24
will that will be so Purp purp fil amen but all these jobs that I went through I
54:31
really did not look forward to going to work I did not enjoy them the waitressing I did not enjoy them you
54:36
know but you have to do it you have to do it this is part of our calling you
54:42
know to do hard things to do things that are not fun and so um use wisdom don't
54:48
you know don't just think I want to start a business but you have to use wisdom businesses generally don't start
54:55
off giving you tons of money immediately usually it's like it takes time and so
55:01
don't just quit a job and like with faith I'm going to start this business and immediately I'm going to get money
55:07
like count the cost use wisdom keep your job while starting on the business and
55:15
then once you see money starting to come in this is a sign okay you know you're counting the
55:22
cost and this is a sign this is God's hand is on this and it is is the right season now to maybe end the other job
55:29
but um it's so important that you don't confuse like the feelings the feelings
55:34
that you have the feelings of like I don't want to work here um with you're just supposed to quit because you don't want to work here and just trust God
55:40
that this business will just take off in one day we got to use wisdom we got to be wise mature Believers and this way
55:47
I've seen a lot happen in the church and it's it's not it's not wisdom it's not
55:54
wisdom and then we find many people not I mean they're they're called to be
55:59
[Music] um people who who who are contributors to the work of God people who can can
56:05
bless others and but they find themselves being stuck and stagnant and in lack and it affecting every other
56:13
area of their life and they bring burdens to others and there's supposed to be this this
56:19
light and it's hindering their light they're supposed to be able to bless others but they're it but it's all
56:25
coming from this lack of wisdom and going by feelings and sometimes going by
56:30
laziness I see this happen a lot people get so excited about you know Revival
56:36
and I just want to um like I just want to serve the Lord
56:42
amen like like yes Hallelujah but we have to to use wisdom with God's timing
56:49
like if we do feel this huge calling we're supposed to we're called to be a servant of God we're called to be a minister um and do full-time Ministry um
56:57
we have to use wisdom many times it's not okay the moment I really feel this big impression and calling I'm I'm
57:03
called to quit everything and you know go on the streets and stuff
57:09
and you know many times we are we are going too quickly like when I received
57:14
my calling I was a nanny part-time for about a year when I started the church you know I was still working so
57:22
um it's time to walk in wisdom and maturity Hallelujah many Ministries talk a lot
57:29
about God's glory working in the glory not so much about the anointing what is the difference your anointing is so
57:34
powerful glory to God so um I would say my calling my calling is
57:43
to to to um share the truth about God's
57:52
kingdom and his power and demonstrate it demonstrate the power of God demonstrate
57:59
the kingdom in
58:06
Simplicity no Bells no whistles no gimmicks that's my
58:14
calling you know so that God can really be glorified fully and also so people can
58:23
understand it's not too complex that people can't can't understand it that
58:28
they can really grasp what the kingdom of God is the
58:33
principles of the kingdom of God um they can really grasp the the power of God The
58:41
Inheritance that God gives us they can really grasp it so that they can be not
58:47
just church goers watching the ministers Minister but like they can be mature
58:53
vessels of God that have great understanding and can help others and can have victory over the devil in their
59:00
own lives and then be vessels of God to help others too so when you go about your life you
59:08
can answer questions you understand you know you have this knowledge you know so and help really
59:16
help people amen so anyways anyways um the anointing is
59:23
simply the power of God the power of God the power of God that destroys
59:29
yolks and that's really the simple way of putting it and so when we see the
59:34
power of God the anointing moving touching
59:40
people that's the glory of God as well that's the presence of God as well
59:46
that's Heaven at hand the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand has come near it's the
59:52
he the Kingdom of Heaven at hand it's the glory of God it's the presence presence of God you know but the what
59:59
how I feel the the best way to describe it is this is the power of God that's making demons be exposed it's the power
1:00:05
of God the tangible touch power of God that's that's that's that's making
1:00:13
spiritual things to happen and to manifest making the Unseen seen yeah so
1:00:20
I think the word anointing has not been used much I think because in the past
1:00:28
because it hasn't been around much maybe people will start to have
1:00:36
manifestations and Encounters of Holy Spirit but there's no demons being manifested
1:00:42
and coming out so people maybe have called it the
1:00:48
glory um but the the power of God is what brings all the Miracles and brings
1:00:56
these encounters with God and the manifestations of his Spirit it exposes the demons it sends
1:01:03
them out it um brings healing it um causes someone to fall back with God's
1:01:09
power as God does a great work in them it um
1:01:14
brings um a feeding in of the spiritual man it opens spiritual eyes it brings
1:01:22
just the move of the holy spirit that brings tears that brings joy that brings
1:01:27
laughter um that knocks somebody out where they're like sleeping In God's
1:01:33
Presence you know to summarize it it's that's the power of God the
1:01:38
anointing if symptoms come back after being delivered and freedom has not been M maintained does that mean you need
1:01:47
Deliverance again or can you just renew your mind and fight for the freedom that was given
1:01:53
already so to some it it's not that you really need to know the clear answer I
1:02:00
would say it's more simple I would say like if you have opened doors you didn't
1:02:06
know how to maintain your deliverance or you didn't take maintaining your deliverance seriously you'll know that
1:02:11
and you should renounce that and you should position yourself where God's power and anointing is and God will do
1:02:17
the rest um so it's not that you really have to figure out like okay did a demon
1:02:24
come back so I need more to Deliverance now or is this just in my mind is this just the devil acting and lying and
1:02:32
saying there's a demon back you know it's not that you really have to like completely figure it out it's it's more
1:02:37
simple that you just need to know what you have done like if you have opened up doors if you haven't taken maintaining
1:02:43
your deliverance seriously renounce that in the presence of the anointing like to come to a live
1:02:49
service where I Minister for example or come in person and go with that intention of like Lord I want all this
1:02:56
out anything that came back in or any lies of the devil that have become like this
1:03:02
stronghold um that I'm that I'm not free I want all of that gone I'm surrendering
1:03:07
that all to you Lord and then you renounce you renounce these areas um that you know
1:03:14
you need to run outs personally and then God just takes care of the rest if there was a demon that came back the anointing will make that demon go simple because
1:03:21
the anointing is so powerful so it's not this like struggle anymore it's not like you need to seek this one-on-one
1:03:26
Deliverance for several hours or something that's why I say you don't need to really figure everything out it's more simple the anointing will take
1:03:33
care of everything God's power will take care of everything if you'll just simply surrender and um
1:03:41
renounce how do we sew into 5f worship for Revival is now flourish events yes
1:03:47
that is a great need because we want to bring the worship team to every flourish
1:03:52
conference that they're able to come that that's possible so um you can there is a flourish fund on
1:04:01
our push pay at 5f church. or under the push pay option um and then you select
1:04:06
that fund and so if you want it specifically to go to 5f worship you can email us and say I just gave this to the
1:04:13
flourish fund I would like this amount to be for the worship how to respond when people accuse 5f of being a lot
1:04:19
about you and your anointing and they brush off the miraculous is this a
1:04:25
jealous they brush off the miraculous is this a jealous spirit I I would it's hard to Adrenalize but I would say a lot
1:04:31
of times if someone is um you know having a problem
1:04:38
with um like honoring a minister then that's usually a sign of
1:04:46
jealousy yeah which is the biggest problem of
1:04:52
people I mean the biggest the biggest hindrance people have have to receiving the moves of God is is you jealousy is
1:05:00
one of the biggest ones that's what the Pharisees problem was with Jesus it
1:05:05
literally says in the Bible because of their jealousy that's why they had him crucified it literally says it in the
1:05:11
Bible so that's that's the big One MH yeah because people with pure hearts
1:05:18
will see the pure in heart shall see God so when people have pure hearts and they
1:05:24
see a Ministry they see any kind of ministry and they see a minister who's anointed and they
1:05:30
see fruits and they see really Miracles happening and they see so many
1:05:35
testimonies and they see that the minister isn't giving glory to themselves but it's always giving glory
1:05:41
to God and then they see people honor the minister they're they will see that
1:05:48
that's all Godly you know they won't have a problem with that that they will see God is here and they will see this
1:05:55
this is this is right because the Bible says we should give honor where honor is due so people who have pure hearts will
1:06:04
see rightly but people who have who don't have pure hearts will see wrongly
1:06:11
they will see like how the Pharisees saw Jesus they saw him as using demonic powers to cast out
1:06:17
demons they saw him as wrongly titling himself uh they called him a false
1:06:24
prophet right so they they they saw him as one who went against
1:06:30
scripture that's how they saw Jesus and so they saw all these things from
1:06:36
twisting everything with their their jealous eyes with their um old
1:06:45
wine so when people have problem with true pure anointed
1:06:51
Ministries you know where honor is given where honor is due um where me much
1:06:56
fruit is that's what's going on it's perverted it's twisted how they
1:07:03
are seen things and it's counterculture of
1:07:08
um how Christianity Christianity has been to walk in the anointing but walking in
1:07:15
the anointing like it's biblical for there to be Apostle Peter's around today it's
1:07:22
biblical for there to be Apostle Paul's around today it says in Acts 1911 that Paul was walking in an extraordinary
1:07:29
anointing so if Paul was around today there would probably be a lot of jealous people of him because why does he get to
1:07:35
walk in extraordinary anointing why do I just get normal anointing what's so special about him to
1:07:41
get extraordinary anointing we're all the same in Christ you know they would
1:07:46
people would feel that kind of way about him but we are a kingdom of God like God
1:07:53
anoints people just like how there are appoint Ed people to be a president vice president Governors Mayors policemen and
1:08:02
women judges teachers all of these people I just described have different
1:08:07
places of authority in society that to working together accomplish the goal of
1:08:14
society of Peace Unity Prosperity Freedom all the things that people hope
1:08:21
for in society right that's s with a kingdom of like a country works right so
1:08:27
that's how the kingdom of God is God God has a vision and goal to destroy the works of the devil to advance God's
1:08:34
kingdom to release his his his Spirit to the world his kingdom so that eyes would
1:08:39
open up to his love that his power would come and open up eyes set people free heal
1:08:45
people and um so God has a goal and the way he accomplishes this this goal is by
1:08:53
anointing his servants in certain positions like president vice
1:08:58
president governor mayor like in the spiritual realm and so it' be like um
1:09:04
Apostle Paul Apostle Peter would be like generals generals but that's needed we
1:09:10
we can't all be like same level there has to be generals there has to be order there has to be higher amounts of power
1:09:17
some places so that they can be releasing to others imparting to others and that they can be at a higher place
1:09:22
to equip others but the these kinds of principles is like Counter Culture
1:09:29
Christian culture mainstream Christian Culture by and large today it's we're all the same and there's no anointing
1:09:36
and so there's no recognition of like oh this is a higher level power here but
1:09:42
what we do see about Peter and Paul carrying such like high level anointing we don't see them full of Pride we see
1:09:49
them walking in humility we don't see that power getting to their heads and we
1:09:54
see them giving all glory to God and so when God chooses people with the right hearts
1:10:00
with pure hearts it's not something to be despised and dangerous for someone to
1:10:07
carry power of God highlevel power of God it's supposed to be seen as a
1:10:13
blessing for others to receive for you to receive from and the greater the cost
1:10:19
that those who walk in that have to go through so it's supposed to be something seen as I I'm glad it was you and not me
1:10:27
and I'm glad I get to receive this blessing um through
1:10:33
you so it's supposed to be seen in that way it's not supposed to be seen as like
1:10:39
this Twisted perverted way it's seen as is you have too much power or um it's
1:10:45
going to go to your head or something and it's not good for you to have that
1:10:50
power or whatever that's just the the Twisted View
1:10:56
but when God chooses who he knows he can trust it does not happen and those with
1:11:03
high level anointing are nothing but a blessing to the body of Christ and give the glory to God and release impartation
1:11:11
of anointing to others so that they can also walk in the high level power of God
1:11:16
too praise God I want to declare over all of you right now thank you Jesus
1:11:22
thank you Lord I declare over all of you now now that any area of Deceit any area
1:11:29
of the angel of Light and old ways creeping in of hearing God's voice
1:11:37
of wisdom like wrong wisdom coming creeping back in old wine things you've
1:11:43
learned in the past that were wrong I declare these to be exposed now and uprooted in jesus' name so any way you
1:11:52
have heard God's voice wrong the angel of Light was speaking may that be exposed and go now in jesus'
1:12:00
name and I declare an increase of wisdom to come upon you I impart wisdom to you
1:12:07
now in jesus' name that from now you would walk in peace not
1:12:14
confusion that you would walk in great wisdom to know God's will to be able to
1:12:21
discern God's will in Jesus name
1:12:26
and I declare every area that you've been bombarded in your mind ways the devil was trying to make
1:12:33
you feel uh um Disturbed anyway he was trying to
1:12:40
steal your peace that must leave you now in jesus' name thank you Lord all worries all
1:12:47
anxieties must go any area of the enemy trying to steal
1:12:53
your fire some those of you that came to flourish any area of the devil trying to steal what you had receiv received to
1:12:58
flourish that fire I declare that to leave now in Jesus name and I declare
1:13:05
anything that's been lost any fire that's been lost peace or Joy I declare
1:13:12
it to be restored now and I release this anointing upon you now be filled with
1:13:19
joy and peace and the fire of God
1:13:26
be filled with the fire of God may you know that God wants you to be in peace always he wants you to be resting in him
1:13:33
always he he wants you to know he's always on your side he wants you to know he never wants you to be condemning
1:13:40
yourself and thinking he's condemning you he wants you to know that every day
1:13:45
should be walking in his peace walking in his rest and in this confidence that
1:13:52
he's with you he's protecting you and he's guiding your steps this is a message for you today
1:14:00
this is a message for you today because some of you I see are like freaking out
1:14:06
unnecessarily some of you are um condemning yourself unnecessarily
1:14:11
some of you are thinking God's condemning you when he's not it's all a scheme of the of the devil simply to
1:14:17
steal your peace and to try to steal your fire so may your eyes open up now
1:14:23
to see God's love for you and to see how safe you are in his hands in the ground that you are planted
1:14:32
with the covering over you may you see how safe you are may you see God's joy
1:14:38
and Delight over you may you remember how valuable and precious you are to God
1:14:44
because you said yes to him when so many have not that you are like the disciples
1:14:50
the chosen disciples that said yes to Jesus that said that said to Jesus where could we go
1:14:55
when many disciples left him and when many were persecuting him there were his
1:15:01
close disciples that said we will never leave where could we go imagine how precious and valuable those disciples
1:15:07
were to Jesus what God is doing in this revival so many have rejected so many have come
1:15:15
and been disciples and then left him so many have persecuted him in this revival
1:15:22
but you have said yes and not only yes but you said where could we go like you've made commitment to God Covenant
1:15:28
to God and so I speak this because such a big part of um walking in God's love
1:15:36
walking in intimacy with God and walking in peace and joy therefore
1:15:44
on fire for God is knowing your
1:15:50
value is knowing how God sees you is knowing how important you are to
1:15:57
God this is so important and so may your eyes open now to see how valuable you
1:16:04
are even when you feel like you're not doing much I remember when our church was so
1:16:11
tiny and it was just Sunday services and that was it I wasn't going live for
1:16:17
years I wasn't going live I was just ministering on Sundays and I wasn't doing that that
1:16:25
much throughout the week I was creating graphics and things and sometimes editing videos but in the beginning not
1:16:30
that much and our church was so small at one time it was 10 one time it was 5 so imagine me at that
1:16:38
time you know I was so important and valuable to God but I didn't feel like I
1:16:44
was doing that much I didn't feel like I was really contributing to the kingdom that much
1:16:51
right so that's I give you that that example because it's very important you
1:16:57
start to see yourself how God sees you and not your circumstances and not what you think is
1:17:04
that you're not doing much just your yes just your support just your being a
1:17:11
disciple just you sharing your testimony like the Samaritan woman at the well is so valuable to God think about how
1:17:16
valuable the Samaritan woman at the well is well was and she just shared her story that's how God sees you and I
1:17:23
share that because God wants this fire to be restored in you if it's been lost and for those of you that hasn't been
1:17:29
lost he wants it to remain in you and this is the big key of keeping that fire burning is to see I'm a disciple of
1:17:36
Jesus I'm important to Jesus he loves me so much and so you don't have to focus
1:17:42
on yourself like you're good you're confident you're you're content and now
1:17:49
your eyes can just be on what God wants you to do on helping others on serving others
1:17:55
instead of dealing with all this stuff that you don't need to be dealing with you passed that you don't need to be dealing
1:18:01
with this the war in your mind the you know you know the truth walk in the
1:18:06
truth amen amen hallelujah praise God and I just I I I
1:18:14
sense from the holy spirit that some of you should bookmark this because
1:18:21
um you know what I've been teaching so much lately ever since flourishes it's time to
1:18:26
mature and um you know I see you I see all of you
1:18:33
like I see you here I I see many of you and I just see your value I see your
1:18:39
importance and it's time for you to see it and and walk in it and don't forget
1:18:45
it this is such a big key to your peace Joy contentment and God being able to
1:18:51
use you and you continue to grow instead of being stagnant so bookmark this especially like what I
1:18:58
shared at the end your value God's calling you to to to know
1:19:03
your value and to move forward from the baby stage of you know constantly Waring
1:19:10
in your mind but walking in the truth knowing God's love and your identity and
1:19:15
your value so you can be valuable in the so you can so you can bring value to the
1:19:22
kingdom you can start doing things for the kingdom because of the valuable heart that you
1:19:27
have it's time to move from having a valuable heart only to Bringing
1:19:33
value to the kingdom with with the works The Works God's calling you to do where
1:19:39
you're able to fully focus on his people on his work amen hallelujah
