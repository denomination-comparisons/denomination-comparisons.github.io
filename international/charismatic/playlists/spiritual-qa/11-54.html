Intro
0:01
can you share more about what you meant when you said God has given you back the blessings given to you as a child when you spoke about the prophetic word I
0:07
believe I was referring to a child of God the blessings that God has given you as a child of God that were taken by the
0:13
enemy when you come into the kingdom when you give your life to Jesus you are
0:19
given an inheritance from God but there's a way to receive it but it's yours in the spiritual realm so it's
0:25
like your inheritance from God is it's an inheritance that's shared with Jesus
0:30
you are coair so all that Jesus has you have you have what the inheritance of
0:35
God is is the resources of Heaven it's healing Freedom Abundant Life peace
0:44
Joy Abundant Life in every area you know when you become a child of God like
0:50
legally in the spiritual realm you receive this inheritance it has your
0:56
name on it but it's like a gift it's like a gift that has your name on it but it has to be opened up and it has to be
1:03
um grabbed by you opened up um valued
1:08
cherished and kept and so the
1:13
enemy the only scheme he has is to try to keep be Believers blind to what they
1:20
really have by lying to them I mean so
1:25
many Believers just straight up do not know they have this inheritance they
1:31
they straight up do not know the meaning of by his stripes you are healed that healing is a gift that
1:38
Jesus has purchased for them that it's theirs that there shouldn't be a question if the devil's trying to steal
1:44
your health and bring sickness and bring pain he's not allowed to do that because
1:50
Jesus has given you healing he has given you Freedom you don't need to accept that this is my portion there's so many
1:55
people that are sick there's so many Believers that are sick so I guess this is just my portion just as it was for them no you know so
2:03
there's so many Believers that have no idea what their inheritance from God really is that they have an inheritance
2:09
what the inheritance is number one and then they don't know how to access it they don't know they don't know how to
2:15
unwrap the gift and they don't know how to um really take in the gift cherish
2:21
the gift keep the gift they don't know this because of all the lies the enemy has spoken so it's like you have the
2:29
enemy has been stealing people's inheritances from God
2:34
people's blessings that God has given them just just by them being a child of God they they have this the enemy has
2:41
taken it so that's what I believe the question is asking when I was sharing about the prophetic word of the year
2:46
that it's a time of recompense it's a time where blessings that have been lost will be restored it's a time that
2:53
people's eyes will open up to see what the enemy has stolen so that they can um
2:59
claim it and receive what they never knew they had if
What could be wrong with your deliverance
3:04
you've been positioned under the anointing for a long time and still are still not delivered of certain things what could be wrong so I just want to
3:10
First this is not a quick answer so I have so many teachings on this I recommend you watch how to receive
3:18
complete deliverance and really really W maybe if you've watched it before watch
3:24
it with a new heart new eyes so God can speak something fresh to you through that give you revelation and how to
3:31
maintain your deliverance because sometimes people receive Deliverance but then not knowing how to really maintain
3:38
it the enemy comes back and so sometimes people may think
3:44
um why am I not being fully delivered maybe they have been delivered but they
3:50
H they don't know how to maintain it they've not been taking their maintaining their Deliverance seriously or they just don't know how to maintain
3:56
it it's not about feelings it's not about feelings that's a big one you have to move past the feelings and and walk
4:03
by faith so like for one so many miracles that happen so much
4:10
Deliverance that takes place is happening without physical manifestations is happening in the
4:16
spiritual realm without you knowing whoa I was just set free right now so much of
4:21
the times that's how it takes place and so but to to Really receive that miracle
4:28
though and keep it you have to value that word that was declared you have to Value the anointing and you have to walk
4:35
in faith meaning I have just received this anointed word I believe I'm Healed I
4:42
believed I believe I am delivered I believe I am free and walk in that so
4:47
many people they're not giving God a chance like they're not giving like God did the miracle but they're not giving
4:52
him a chance yet they're looking for the physical manifestations to as evidence
4:58
when really you need to give God a chance like you need to walk in faith and believe God is give God a chance in
5:05
terms of like seeing it manifest um rather than putting pressure
5:10
on to see the evidence immediately and so some people maybe they don't realize they're not walking in faith but they're
5:17
not walking in faith and that's how the enem is able to steal it sometimes God
5:22
has a plan to bring Deliverance over time layer by layer um and sometimes God
5:28
has a plan to to deliver a person of something in person sometimes God wants
5:33
sometimes God wants the person to make a sacrifice and come in person and receive
5:39
this Deliverance there's so many different reasons as to why a person may
5:45
not be seen full Deliverance yet when they are planted under the anointing there's so many and so that's why I I
5:53
share some of them right here right now quickly but I have teachings on this
5:58
there is also message message I I have called mysteries of healing but that's more of talking about why some people
6:04
don't see healing but I do also go in depth of how some people why aren't they
6:09
see the seeing the healing yet these are some reasons and I know I have a message I can't think of the name of it right
6:15
now but I know I can't remember if it was a subscriber Q&A the last few months sometime the last few months or if it
6:21
was a live that I really answered in depth this question um so I can't tell
6:28
you right now the name of it but if someone does remember you can write in the comments but I I remember answering
6:35
this question in depth just a few months ago so um yeah I encourage you to to
6:40
watch these videos my husband's ex-girlfriend has a lot of pain for months and it moves around in her body
What is your spiritual domain
6:47
are we anointed to cast demons out of her and is it our domain if she says yes
6:54
yeah so where your domain is where your spiritual domain is is the people in your life that God is given you you know
7:00
everybody in your life that's in your uh in your workplace in your family um
7:07
people on your social media acquaintances from the past um friends from the past that maybe you're not you
7:14
don't stay in touch with anymore but just anybody that you're and just People You Meet um doing errands and things or
7:22
traveling um God has brought these people to you to for you to be the light
7:28
of the world to to them to shine Jesus's light to plant seeds and for some it's
7:33
going to look more like doing more than just showing the love of God through
7:40
kindness but it's going to also look like ministering casting out demons at
7:45
times praying for the sick um operating with in the prophetic anointing
7:51
encouraging them edifying them it's going to look like that sometimes um and so all the people in in in your domain
7:59
that God is calling you to be a vessel to are going to be the people in your
8:07
family your extended family and friends those who are not planted at um
8:14
the church you are planted at because the people that are planted at the church you are planted at that they are
8:19
under the domain the Spiritual Authority of your leader your your Collective
8:24
spiritual leader now you can still be a vessel of God to People by showing love
8:29
by serving them by helping them but in the area of actually casting out demons
8:36
out of them for example that wouldn't be your domain to do that for the people
8:42
that are planted at the church you you are planted at now that's that is when
8:47
there's real anointing there when there's real true anointing there it's like the times of apostle Peter you know
8:54
it says they brought all the sick and Demon oppressed under his shadow and all were healed so you know we don't ever
9:01
see Peter saying okay I have prayed for some of you I have cast demons out of some of you but now for others of you
9:10
you need to um seek other people in this same church here to pray for you to cast
9:16
the demons out of you we just don't see Peter saying that we never see that
9:23
actually in the acts church we never see Jesus instructing that but rather we see
9:28
this princip of Spiritual Authority domain um you know it specifically even
9:35
Paul it says they would bring handkerchiefs and aprons to him and the anointing would be released upon them
9:41
and then they would release those handkerchiefs and aprons to everyone and that needed it and all were healed now
9:47
this is talking about really his congregation and who was coming to receive his ministry so it wasn't like
9:54
okay I'll do a few handkerchiefs um and and put them on a
10:00
few people on a handful of people and then my anointing will dry up and you're going to have to find someone else to to
10:07
finish the job to do the job or finish the job type thing we just don't see that you know what we do see is this
10:13
principle of Spiritual Authority that I teach that I've also teached way more in depth you can watch that I'm I'm trying
10:20
to think of the names of some of the sermons there it's about Kingdom Authority um spiritual territories is
10:26
one of the messages it's under the um Revival army training playlist on my YouTube you can find these messages to
10:33
really learn more I write about it in my book The Secret of the anointing as well
10:39
yeah so anyways um if someone is a family member or friend that is not
10:44
planted where you are that maybe they are not they're not really receiving yet
10:51
and being planted where you are planted or maybe they they are new to Deliverance for example and you start
10:58
shining the light of Jesus to them you start sharing your testimony and sharing how you've been delivered so they may
11:06
open up they may open up and want freedom want deliverance and that could
11:11
be a time where you can say would you like me to pray for you I believe God will deliver you and that's a time where it's your
11:18
domain and God is God is leading you to use your Authority in Christ and command
11:24
the demons to go from that person and when we see someone who's oppressed with
11:29
demons we don't only want them to be to be free we want them to be also coming
11:35
into the kingdom we want them to not only be you know say the sinner's prayer
11:40
or something I mean they don't need to say the sinner's prayer I just mean um confessing that Jesus is Lord not only
11:47
confessing Jesus is Lord with their mouth and receiving him as their lord and savior but we also want them to be
11:52
equipped to be who God created them to be and the only way they can be equipped to be who God created them to be and to
11:58
be Victor Victorious over the devil to maintain their freedom and to be able to be a powerful vessel of God they have to
12:05
be planted in a church in a true church where God's anointing is moving um this is according to Ephesians 4:11 as it
12:12
talks about the five-fold ministry so so yeah it's not just cut and dry when you see someone who's
12:18
oppressed it's not just cut and dry like oh I'm supposed to cast demons out of them now and that's it you need to have
12:25
the heart for them the heart that God has for them for them to be free for them to know God's love for them to be
12:32
saved for them to be equipped to be victorious over the enemy for them to
12:37
fulfill their purpose like we need to have all of that heart for them not just
12:43
not only I want them to be free we need to have all of that you know not only I
12:48
want this demon to go from them now not only that you know because if we have only that
12:53
heart you know you can just be casting demons out of people and
12:59
more demons come back because they're not equipped to know how to maintain their freedom and they don't know that
13:06
there's more they don't they think maybe they can just go about their life now they got the fix right um you know we
13:14
need to really have that heart so I say all of that to say is that sometimes
13:19
some someone like that like this is a extended family member right that's not planted at the church where you're
13:26
planted um this is the time to show show God's love through Deliverance if if God
13:31
is leading that it's not going to be like every single situation I'm saying is the if the holy spirit's leading you to cast The Demon out um it's going to
13:39
be a situation of showing God's love through this and as their eyes open up to God's love this helps prepare their
13:45
hearts to receive more to receive him as Lord to have the desire to come and be
13:51
equipped at a church where God's power is moving perhaps where you are planted for example if you do pray for the
13:58
person to be set free is so important to follow up to also tell them this is the
14:03
love of Jesus for you you know this isn't just that healing power that I have you know it's not like I'm a doctor
14:10
or I have this Supernatural power of new AG or something like this this is Jesus's love you have been set free
14:16
right now because of Jesus's love for you and so I encourage you to give your
14:22
whole life to him to surrender to him and it's so important you keep this keep
14:29
this Freedom you've received how you keep this is by maintaining your freedom how do you maintain your freedom you got
14:35
to be equipped how do you be equipped come to the church come to a church where God's power is moving like my
14:40
church for example and be a disciple you know uh it's important you share all
14:45
that too that's what I mean and I also share that also so you can kind of have that understanding of how spiritual
14:50
domain and territory works like when is it time to cast The Demon out it's it's
14:56
for a great purpose it's for the person to be for yes but it's for even more too
15:02
so that's how you will be able to really understand and be in order be in order and hear the Holy Spirit Lead You of one
15:07
to um walk in your Authority and cast out demons this is what God wants for all of
God wants you to come in person
15:14
his children to absolutely come in person as much as they can you know of course this depends on the season this
15:19
depends on the provision that God is releasing but God absolutely wants all of his children if they are planted
15:25
online from AAR he absolutely wants all of his children to come in person from time to time as much as possible to come
15:32
and receive even more in person and there's there's a more that you receive when you come a person especially because there's a sacrifice so sometimes
15:39
God is wanting you to make a sacrifice to to then release more when I would go
15:45
to my spiritual father's Church in Tanzania East Africa I went many times and when I went to Tanzania I received
15:51
impartation another level of impartation and when I went back to minister at fivefold church um this is when I saw
15:57
God move in power for the very first time this is when I saw him move in power in the prophetic anointing um and
16:06
saw manifest the Manifest power of God moving and touching people and it it
16:12
kept it kept growing from that moment it it just kept growing from there um but
16:18
really the reason why was because God wanted me to make a sacrifice because it was so valuable what he wanted to
16:24
release to me in the spirit it was so valuable that he wanted me to make a a sacrifice and come in person he could
16:30
have released it just um without coming in person he totally can do that I mean he does so many miracles healing
16:37
deliverance and impartation through the screen all the time we see that all the time but sometimes God withholds until
16:44
you you make the sacrifice and then he releases what is the difference between
Being bold for Jesuss Glory or being prideful
16:49
being bold for Jesus's Glory or being prideful when I share about Jesus my husband gets angry and offended what may
16:56
I do differently well um if you're sharing about Jesus not being prideful you know I mean if you're simply if your
17:02
heart is to share about what Jesus is doing share about the Miracles he's doing that's not being prideful that's
17:08
the enemy trying to tell you you're being prideful so that you will um
17:13
stifle your light so when someone needs Deliverance
17:18
that means there's a demonic there's demons that are influencing them um you know if someone has a spirit
17:28
of a a demon of anxiety for example a spirit of
17:35
anxiety they themselves are not full of anxiety but rather a a demon
17:42
will just ignite itself like activate itself
17:47
to be full of unleash such strong feelings of fear and
17:54
anxiety and then so that person really adopts those feelings
17:59
because when a person needs Deliverance that demonic spirit is it's a bondage of some sort it's you know the person can't
18:06
just reject the demon and the demon leaves there's a chain in the spiritual realm that's why a person needs Deliverance only the anointing the power
18:12
of God destroys the Yoke um and so anything any kind of Oppression it means
18:20
that a demon is controlling a certain area it means there's a chain controlling a certain area so it's a demon influencing a person and the
18:28
person can't Escape that influence unless they seek Jesus and his way of freeing which is by his anointing which
18:34
is moving through vessels that's the only way that's the only way um is to
18:41
seek Jesus now the main way is the main way that God brings Deliverance is by
18:47
moving through vessels so to come to a church to come to a live stream where God's power is moving through a vessel
18:54
that's the main way God moves to bring Deliverance but God God can move out God
18:59
can move in different ways sometimes um those are more like anomalies though like but sometimes he will he will move
19:04
in different ways but he doesn't change the fact that this is his main way of moving so yes God can deliver somebody
19:10
without a without a vessel some people have been delivered as soon as they're saved um addiction was gone I mean as
19:16
soon as they gave their life to Jesus it just left them that does happen sometimes but it's not a majority of the time right so unless a person seeks
19:23
Jesus and usually going to the to going to a church where God's power is moving position positioning themselves under a
19:29
vessel where who carries anointing where the anointing is flowing through that's
19:35
the only way they receive Deliverance is by seeking Jesus and usually that that way by the anointing moving through a
19:41
vessel so without that whenever a person has a demonic spirit that demonic spirit
19:47
is influencing them and they don't have a choice about it like that that's why you know you think about people who um
19:57
abuse like spouses for example or Partners romantic Partners you know they
20:03
like genuinely love them love them and then out of nowhere with just a fit of anger comes or something and they they
20:10
hurt them they like they physically hurt them sometimes sometimes it could be verbally but like they treat them as if
20:17
they hate them but they don't hate them at all at all they actually love them they actually love the person more than
20:23
anyone in the world right so how does that make sense because it's a demon influencing the person and the person
20:29
has no control but to be influenced so it's like the demon possesses the person
20:35
at the time I don't mean possess every little area but it's like taking over for a moment so
20:42
um demons hate the devil hates Jesus demons hate Jesus demons don't want to hear about Jesus so sometimes if a
20:48
person needs Deliverance if you're talking about Jesus the demons can influence the person to be very angry
20:56
that you're talking about Jesus so that that's that's what it is that's what it is so it's important to make sure that
21:02
you keep you keep shining your light um use wisdom you know if people don't want
21:09
to hear you don't need to keep speaking all the time but pray for the person
Keep shining your light
21:18
pray for the person call them into the kingdom call them into the kingdom and
21:23
pray that their eyes will open up and bring them before God bring them before
21:29
God in with your heart with your um bring with in your prayer requests when
21:35
you seow you know thanking God for doing Miracles and believing he's doing them and you you sew seeds of Thanksgiving
21:42
for the Miracles you believe he's going to do like these prayer request seeds you know like of Thanksgiving I mean um
21:49
bring them bring the person before God in that way too um but make sure you're not um
21:56
letting your light be stifled you know and that's why it's important to walk in wisdom like if someone does not want to receive um the light of
22:05
Jesus and you know you keep pushing and they're
22:10
um getting really angry that's going to that can be a threat to stifle your
22:17
light you know because when you when you shine the light of Jesus this is the good news what what's better than
22:23
sharing good news right how much do you love to share the good news with people sharing the good sharing good news is
22:28
the best it's the most joyful thing in the world I always feel so much joy
22:34
whenever I after I preach after I go live because it's just so exciting to
22:39
share the good news it's exciting to share about Jesus it's it's so exciting and I know that people's lives are being
22:46
changed eyes are opening up the devil's in his lives they're being defeated oh
22:52
it's so exciting to share the good news you know and so we got to make sure we
22:57
protect that we protect um our peace we protect our heart guard your heart for
23:04
everything that you do flows from it so um sharing the good news should not be
23:10
something we're afraid of or we're worried that people are not going to receive well or um we're bracing
23:17
ourselves for um push back it's something that we should share with joy
23:24
and boldly and excitedly always and so what I'm saying is you know don't give
23:30
pearls to swines don't um keep sharing this amazing news and someone's
23:36
ridiculing you for doing such a good thing and twisting it enemy twisting it
23:41
as if you're doing a bad thing as if you're sh it's like you're prideful or something that's that's a lie of the
23:46
devil amen so guard your heart protect your peace and use wisdom
23:53
amen I always hear how demons can come back if our soul isn't healed what should we do be doing to heal our soul I
How to heal your soul
23:59
don't think that's something I've ever preached um that demons can come back if our soul
24:05
isn't healed if you're planted at 5f I just encourage you to empty yourself out you know of of other of old wine of
24:14
other other things that God needs you to empty out so you can be a true disciple
24:20
and really grow and really intake this new wine fully so I have
24:26
a uh I think it's four four part sermon series on how to maintain your
24:31
deliverance so I go very in depth in all of that so if you see me not mentioning
24:37
something like make sure your Soul's healed you know that means you don't need to like worry like just look at the
24:45
teachings that I've shared and take them to heart and then just rest knowing that
24:51
as you value these teachings you don't have to take in worries from other people
24:57
releasing other things who aren't called to speak into your life who aren't called to carry this anointing to equip
25:05
you to be delivered and maintain your freedom should I take off days from work
Should I take off days from work
25:11
to catch up on the weeks and months I didn't take you serious I think she's I think you're meaning to say I didn't
25:18
take the word of God serious the teachings released um where you are
25:24
planted seriously well well for the most part
25:29
you know the Bible says it's very important we work um because this is the way that this is the main way that God
25:36
releases provision is as we work that you know God opens up doors
25:41
for us to have a job so then he can release the provision to us through that job that's the main way he releases
25:48
provision and he really wants you to not be in lack he wants you to have
25:54
more than enough um so that he can use you also in that area financially you
26:01
know to contribute to the work of God to bless others to do whatever he's asking you to do to be a steward so um
26:10
generally like a general answer is not to like stop working usually usually God
26:18
wants people to be working remain in work and really have that Revelation
26:24
that God wants me to be in abundance God wants me to be a good Steward he has all
26:30
these seeds he's releasing me and he's trusting me to gather them value them and release them where he's calling me
26:36
to and so God wants us to have that Revelation that where we are working
26:42
this is God providing not just to bless us but providing seed for us to be sers
26:50
into his kingdom to do what he's calling us to do with these seeds um so you know
26:56
you can you should see work as a spiritual thing you know what I mean you shouldn't see it as something separate
27:02
but this is a a a very important part of receiving from God receiving provision
27:07
from God Amen and so that's just a general answer there can be times when the Holy Spirit saying take a day off
27:14
from work today for whatever reason but generally it won't be that often because
27:21
we're just called to be honest good people good citizens in all areas of
27:27
life so you know our the boss is counting on you to be there at work you
27:32
said you're going to be there at work um so it's important we remain honest we
27:39
are responsible we show up on time and there's a scripture that says serve your
27:46
boss basically we'll say it in this these words boss as you're serving the lord do the work do when you do work do
27:53
it as unto you're doing it to the Lord amen so um it's just important to just
How do you show Jesus through your actions
28:00
be a person that represents Jesus well that a p you know people see you that's
28:05
that's a testimony in itself I mean that's that's how we be the light of the world is not just talking about Jesus
28:13
but showing Jesus through our lives showing Jesus through our actions so that we are responsible we are so
28:20
respectful of people of all people we're respectful of all people and we do what
28:26
we say we're going to do we let our yes be yes yes and let our no be no and we're someone that people can
28:32
rely on you know we're not flimsy wishy-washy or anything and that's very
28:39
important because we need to be respectable people when a person respects you they are
28:45
more prone to listen to you to hear wisdom that you have and to take
28:54
it seriously so our actions need to match our
29:00
message you know so people won't take you seriously people won't take the words you say seriously if you
29:09
are seen as not someone they can rely on or someone that's lying or someone
29:15
that's not responsible so it's very important these are big things these are not small things amen and so okay back
29:23
to the question you know maybe you have if you didn't take seriously the teaching means maybe you were planted
29:29
somewhere but you were being lukewarm or you weren't being really a true disciple
29:36
um now it's time to make intention to be very serious about the word of God
29:43
but you don't need to feel like you're drowning like to catch up or something you don't need
29:52
to like Let The Shame of the past ENT your now you know know that's the past
30:00
that's in the past it's gone and um sure you have a lot of
30:05
learning to do but you you don't need to fret and worry like you have to pack in
30:11
tons of teachings in one day that won't work very well actually because you really need to meditate on the word you
30:18
you shouldn't go fast through the the teachings through the word of God written and the the spoken word of God
30:24
the teachings you should never go fast you should really meditate take your time that's what God wants so that there can be real growth so focus on that
30:31
don't worry about the past amen you have plenty of time to
30:37
grow there's there's plent you have plenty of Life to Live still you know there's no reason to feel like you have
30:43
to rush things at what point in our growth would we know when we can help
When can we help and encourage others
30:48
and encourage others spiritual health not stop on ours but give more Focus to
30:53
helping others is this something we will just know slash Holy Spirit Will Lead
31:00
this of course this just depends on the person the season their calling you know
31:05
but um just in general just in general like for those who are not if we're
31:12
talking about people who are not currently anointed um and sent out as
31:18
five-fold ministers leading a church leading a Ministry but you are a Believer who is
31:26
um maybe you don't know like your exact direction from God right now of
31:31
your specific calling of course we we all have the same purpose and calling and we never need to feel anxious like
31:37
what's my specific purpose because um we're already doing we're already doing
31:44
such powerful things and already fulfilling our purpose before the time
31:50
has come where God speaks something reroutes you if that's needed because it's it's
31:57
different for everybody like our purpose is to be the light of Jesus to be a vessel of him to be a
32:04
vessel of him that's our purpose that's our purpose and so you can be a powerful vessel of him as being a fightful
32:10
minister you can be a powerful vessel of him not being a fightful minister being um a doctor a lawyer a teacher a
32:17
construction worker a um one who's his who's taking care of of of kids at home
Being a powerful vessel of God
32:24
and isn't working in a job right now you can be a powerful vessel of God there too and remember we're all one body and
32:31
we have all different parts to play and we are all vessels of God so for some
32:36
people maybe God will reroute them and that he will reroute them to a different career path because at this career path
32:45
um they are fulfilling their purpose fully
32:50
like like even more specifically like in an even greater way than they were before right like
32:58
like let's say God is giving you a certain gift and when you pursue that
33:03
certain gift God's able to lift you for his glory because of like that gift opens up
33:10
doors and then God uses that Lifting for you to reach more people um maybe that's
33:17
it but it's not always about like the number of people that doesn't mean like oh I'm not reaching that amount that
33:24
many people so must be I haven't found my purpose yet no sometimes you won't
33:30
have a huge platform but the platform you do have is is I mean God's doing
33:39
such powerful things through that right I think about I'm just thinking about my aunt right now my mom's um my mom's
33:48
sister and she's an art teacher and um there she would just love the kids with
33:55
Love Of Christ there's a lot of troubled kids that would come through and she would just love love the children with the love of Christ beautifully and um I
34:02
remember I didn't know how to have a relationship with God until
34:08
like basically mid 20s and so but and so
34:13
like throughout my childhood and middle school years my aunt planted a lot of seeds in me like she just I could tell
34:19
she was this friend of God I I could tell she had something special a special love a special like friendship and I
34:24
didn't know like how she had that um but I wanted that you know and um my
34:33
grandpa he was a music teacher a band director just like my mom both my mom
34:38
and her dad were um band directors in schools pretty small
34:45
schools and so that would be Al also the ant that I'm talking about it also be her father as well and so it's very
34:51
similar for him whenever I would go and visit my grandparents my Grandpa would just talk about Jesus
34:58
with this love I hadn't seen I hadn't seen somebody talk about Jesus like that before I could just tell he had such a
35:04
real authentic love for Jesus and he loved the Bible and I don't even remember like our conversations but I
35:11
just remember he loved to talk about God and he'd always be talking about God with me and there was just these seeds
35:16
planted in me it was the same he passed away when I was uh I think 19 18 or 19
35:23
so but my memories of him you know it was in my lukewarm time
35:28
I was lukewarm and in going trying things in the world and high school and but I I just remember the way he talked
35:34
about God I'm like I don't know how to have that but I want that and I know there's
35:40
more and um so you know my my aunt both my aunt and my grandpa they were in tiny
35:47
tiny towns and um my aunt's retired now um but she touched many lives through
35:53
teaching art but like what an impact they had on my life that every I just I I know like
36:00
the seeds they planted it was God speaking to me through them there's more
36:07
seek me more and there's a friendship that you don't have yet with me that I
36:15
want you to have see this is real and so seek me and you'll find
36:22
that and um yeah so I just shared that story because they both T were just
36:29
teaching jobs in very small towns um I think my aunt probably there was
36:34
probably like between 15 to 40 people in the whole entire grade like my aunt she
36:41
lived she lives half an hour from where I grew up and I grew up in a really tiny town too but like and even my my parents
36:48
too but like they had they had such you know um think about the amount of lives
36:54
they're touching now through my life through my Ministry you know like if I didn't have these
37:01
people in my life that God used I wouldn't be here today you know I
37:07
wouldn't be ministering today I could be off in the world I could be lost completely absolutely I know that I know
37:16
that you know um so yeah I just I share that a little bit of tangent to
Whats your purpose
37:23
share sometimes we're like what's my purpose what's my purpose and we think it has to be reaching a lot of people
37:30
right whether it's like in the secular world that you would be the leader of a
37:36
company or something you know something high up you know so that you could reach more people that's true sometimes like
37:41
sometimes God gives somebody a gift to go in the secular world to be a bright light to people to reach so many people
37:49
absolutely absolutely but it's not always that it's important we're not looking for um numbers you know to it's
37:57
support because some people they're already like my my aunt my grandpa for
38:03
example my my mom my mom is a music teacher too my dad was a physical education teacher teaching gym class fiz
38:10
Head Sports and coaching right you know they had you know found their calling
38:16
their calling wasn't so much about like this is the career you must have
38:22
but it's what God really did in in their life in their life you know touching
38:28
people he needed to touch touching me touching the the students too but so many times people were like thinking the
38:35
purpose is like a certain career whether it's in the secular world or whether it's Ministry and we're see but you know
38:43
you think about these family members that I'm sharing with you they it was as simple
38:49
as God put it on their they had these passions they had these giftings they wanted to teach they had these giftings
38:54
of sports of music of Art and and um they went to school for that and then they got the job and like they're
39:02
fulfilling their purpose it wasn't this like prophecy moment for them you know it was this gentle still Small Voice
39:08
leading them um you know and so I I you
39:15
know I say all that to say um to just give you Insight of your
39:21
purpose of your purpose so now back to the question about how to know when to
39:26
shift to really helping people really helping people with their spiritual health um and not F still focusing on
39:33
yourself but not focusing like solely on yourself so I mean this is our
39:39
calling I mean day one we become a Believer we are called to help people we are called to spread the good news which
39:45
is helping people with their spiritual health um sharing what God's shown us
Being a mentor
39:51
reveal to us sharing what we learned about in church sometimes with people um we're called called to that
39:56
from day one and so it'll increase as time goes by but it's not really for the most part a time where it's like okay
40:04
I'm pretty equipped now so now I need to go out and seek people I can mentor like
40:10
have that heart and intention you know like I'm I mean have be open like if God
40:16
lord if you want me to specifically Mentor one person or if you specifically want me to really take intention with
40:22
somebody I'm open Lord but the Bible says don't don't um you shouldn't desire
40:28
to teach because teachers are judged more strictly now God needs lots of
40:33
teachers he needs lots of people to be fful ministers and to teach the word of God but really what the scripture is
40:41
saying is like don't jump into taking the place of being a minister taking the place of being a mentor when God is not
40:49
calling you to the best thing to do unless God is specifically and for sure
40:54
calling you to be a mentor to be a teacher to be a fivefold Minister the best thing to do is to um
41:02
just love people well and when people ask questions when people admire you
41:09
like how you seem spiritually mature you seem very Christlike they need help you
41:14
seem to um have it together you know or you know you
41:19
seem like someone who could help them and they come to you the best thing to do is to help them to help them how the
41:25
holy spirit's leading you but not to jump into the position of um being a
41:32
spiritual leader over their lives so the best thing to do is to be honest you know the best thing to do is you can
41:37
share you can share a lot with them you can share a lot of the teachings that you've learned for example that have really helped you but it's important
41:45
you're honest about it like so I've been delivered I've been transformed I've matured so much because
41:52
of this because I've planted myself in a church where God's power is where he led me to this is how we get delivered this
41:59
is how we be equipped this is how we mature and so I did what I did God's principles I did it God's way and this
42:07
is the result um and so I've learned so much about the spiritual realm I've
42:12
received so much spiritual food from my spiritual leader um and like for example
42:18
this is what I've learned and you can share them things that you've learned you know um but it's important for you
42:23
to like refer them this is where I've learned it um so that they don't like
42:28
look at you they don't put you on a pedestal that God hasn't put you on um they don't see you in a light that
42:37
you're not supposed to be seen at because it can be dangerous because you're not called to that yet you're not ready to that yet ready for that yet it
42:42
could be an open door for the enemy um but you really encourage the best thing you do is to encourage them if they're
42:48
interested in really being helped and really growing spiritually to come receive what at my church come
42:56
be equipped come plant yourself you know um and at the same time make sure you're
43:02
putting up healthy boundaries because um you know you just have to you you
Guard your heart
43:09
only have a certain capacity you have to guard you know guard your heart um when
43:16
God's not calling you to devote tons and tons of time somewhere it's important you're obedient to that and know that
43:24
only Jesus can help somebody um and you're not someone's savior so as much
43:29
as they're trying to make you that don't give in that you know don't give into that manipulation but above all
43:36
answering the question of like how do I know when the shift it's not really so much of a shift but it's just really
43:43
being open I mean it's not really so much of a shift of like okay I've grown quite a bit so now maybe I can focus on
43:49
helping others more it's not so much of a shift as to just like being ready
43:54
showing the love of Christ everywhere and being ready being ready for more being being ready to help people more to
44:03
um to share to share more about what you've learned to share more about God
44:08
with people being ready but being sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit rather than like feeling pressure
44:14
like oh I don't know if I'm helping enough people um you know the the people
44:20
in your workplace that's a big area God is calling you to to be the light too
44:27
um and you know you don't have to feel forceful about it like um trying to
44:35
trying to make things happen you know God God will lead you God will bring the people in your life
44:42
he wants um he wants to use you to be a vessel to touch do you disciple a group of people
44:49
that wants to get in the ministry or wants to go deeper so for my calling specifically bringing
My calling
44:55
this new wine that the world needs for my calling specifically right now um God
45:01
has really called me to be discipling the Nations you know I go live so
45:07
frequently I do these subscriber q&as as a time to really it's it's like a small
45:13
group but it's it's a lot of people you know what I mean but just with what my
45:18
calling is right now um so that I can reach all the people that God wants me
45:23
to reach he's really called me in this season is in this season um to disciple
45:30
people publicly to not make it like super exclusive and to this small
45:37
group of people but um Jesus has so much work to do in the whole world so much
45:43
and he's going to be moving so fast I mean we are going to be having five half
45:48
Church branches for example in many places around the world Hallelujah and
45:55
um he he wants this new wine to go out throughout the whole world um and so because God is moving
46:03
exceptionally fast and wide um globally you know we have people
46:08
planted from 51 Nations currently glory to God
Deeper commitment
46:14
um so because of this it's kind you know a lot of Ministries I know they have more of like um more private exclusive
46:22
type discipleship um groups and so my what God has called me to do is different but
46:29
it's not anything lacking I'm just really making it public the subscriber
46:35
q&as are that we're on right now is is kind of a deeper step a deeper
46:41
commitment and um those who have this desire to grow
46:47
more and to be used even more powerfully by God and it's this time where I I ask
46:52
your personal questions so it's really very much like if we're in a room together and you are raising your hands
47:00
you know and I'm talking to you face to face it's pretty much the same you know
47:06
um so yeah that's what God has called me now I have so many teachings out there
47:11
and but they're not meant to be just like this broad teaching for the congregation that's like milk so much
47:18
meat it's so much true discipling that's happening and God is God is in the
47:26
season now of laying the foundation and feeding the people so much it's not a
47:34
there's so much work to be done there's so much old wine to get out there's so much new wine to get in there's so much
47:41
so many things to unlearn there's so many new things to learn so um it's not a time to rush into
47:48
Ministry and I think that like in other places it's kind of maybe
When to rush into Ministry
47:54
more like I feel called to Ministry you know come be a part of some sort of like discipleship group or maybe Bible
48:01
College you know and it's just like okay I'm going to go through this training and then I'm going to start ministering now you know kind of like a quick thing
48:08
but with what God is doing here now you know you think about the disciples that were with Jesus they were with him for
48:14
three years three years just learning just learning and after the three years
48:20
they were then ready to go out and to minister and then they were doing the same Works Jesus was doing and so um it
48:28
wasn't like this quick thing it wasn't this this quick quick quick thing so
48:34
really um it's not you know what God has called me to is not like to quickly turn
48:43
people into ministers type thing to quickly disciple them and commission them to be ministers now there can be some people who um already called by God
48:51
are already ministers but we missing the anointing people who were kind of like Elisha
48:57
whom didn't find their elijas yet and God is calling to Humble themselves and come and receive the anointing and that
49:04
make go quicker but it's because God has already been um preparing this person
49:09
throughout their life bringing them through refining fire um and also
49:15
because they're already in the place of ministry he may want to keep them in Ministry even though they still have a lot of new wine to learn but he still
49:22
can use them um even if they're not like perfect yet and you know still getting
49:28
that old wine out he can still use them amen so there's those types of situations where people are already in
49:35
Ministry and God may call them to come and receive the anointing and be a disciple and you know not flat out like
49:42
stop their church until you know until they get all the old line out and you
49:47
know are perfect no he can he may still be calling them to minister but that's why it's very important that they are
49:53
honest of where they're receiving from so people can also come and receive the new wine from the Elijah they are
50:01
receiving from as well amen but yeah so that we're in a season right now where
50:07
God is preparing it's like the disciples who came to Jes came close to Jesus they
50:13
couldn't imagine their future they just all they knew was they were following Jesus and they were so amazed by The
50:19
Miracles that they were witnessing they were so excited and amazed to be chosen
50:24
and to be contributors to the work of God to be contributing financially like the women who were close with Jesus to
50:31
be preparing for the events and doing all the logistical things they they just felt so blessed and excited to do that a
50:38
lot of them didn't really realize they were going to do the same things Jesus was doing they were actually going to be anointed to be Apostles you know there's
50:44
a lot of people out there right now there's a lot of people who are um some of you you know uh so many at 5f church
50:52
from around the from around the world who are who are being prepared to to be
50:57
five-fold ministers they don't know it yet but God is preparing them um and
51:02
there's so many whom God is calling to be such powerful vessels of God not fful ministers but such Mighty powerful
51:08
vessels of God in different ways and in different um influencing large amounts
51:14
of people or um influencing very um impactful people in the world just
51:19
there's so so many things that you that many don't know yet that God is just in
51:25
the business of preparing ing right now amen oh I just want to mention
Gods calling is unlikely
51:31
another reason why God leads me to disciple differently than maybe other
51:36
people do is that a lot of the people God's calling
51:42
are unlikely vessels and are people that would
51:47
never you know like if I if I made just an exclusive group like if you feel called to be a minister join and I will
51:55
equip you and send you you know you know what a lot of people that God actually
52:00
anointed wouldn't wouldn't join I mean that would be me you know what I mean not in a million if you know if
52:07
someone if if if if my spiritual father like showed up to that conference and was like any of you that feel called to
52:14
Ministry any of you that feel called to be a minister to be a pastor um you know
52:20
I'm going to be discipling you so sign up here I'm gonna have a discipleship
52:25
group you know I would never have signed up just because I didn't see that for
52:31
myself and it wasn't a desire it was not a desire My Desire was to be a singer so um you know God had to speak
52:40
through the prophet and say this is your calling um so yeah so there's a lot of
52:45
people that are just like me that have no desire to be a minister but yet God
52:52
needs them to be equipped God is prepar pring them for the time he will anoint
53:00
them that's a big reason why um why what God is doing through me is
53:06
different this is and and you know that goes along with the with the way Christianity by in large is today you
53:13
know Christianity by and large today um by and large
53:19
it's examples like me are hard to come by like the weak and foolish things the
53:25
people who did not want be a minister it's usually people who went to Bible school because they wanted to be a
53:30
minister it's usually people who have Charisma or a natural speaking gift and or it's people that just like love to
53:36
preach the Bible and just naturally like can just preach like have
53:42
this this um this passion and gifting to preach usually though in today's time of Christianity usually those are the ones
53:49
that become pastors but look at the Disciples of Jesus nobody was like at
53:56
the synagogue saying I I I feel called I want to be a pastor they were
54:03
fishermen they were Tax Collectors they were Average Joe people but those are
54:08
the ones that that Jesus called and it's so important that the right ones are called because those are the ones who
54:14
won't walk in Pride but who will walk in humility those are the ones that God sees their heart and sees he can trust
54:20
them that's why it's so important and that's such a big part of God refining
54:25
his church and bringing Purity back in the church is by God choosing the
54:31
anointed leaders not them choosing themselves or not their family members choosing them and not um colleges
54:39
choosing them you know so that's a big reason that's a big reason is that why
54:46
this really discipleship is so so public the meaty
54:51
discipleship is public hallelujah it's a free gift free gift GI
54:57
free gift to the worlds to be discipled amen
Fear of God
55:04
hallelujah will you ever feel actual fear when you have the fear of God the
55:11
fear of God really means reverence and
55:16
respect um and so there can sometimes be this like um
55:23
adrenaline feeling uh like uh I don't want to be out of God's will
55:31
I don't want to displease him like there can be that but that I
55:38
consider just like a high form of respect and
55:43
reverence you know like you know in the Bible sometimes people they're just like they just bow before God they can't help
55:50
but to like bow before God and they're like trembling and the angel appears
55:56
many times Angel be of Mary do not be afraid um
56:02
so like God is so big and the more we can
56:07
um have our eyes open up to how big he is how Mighty he is um
56:14
how how serious it is that we please him and stay in his will and be dis be be
56:22
obedient like the more serious you take it sure maybe there could be adrenaline sometimes but it shouldn't be like this
56:28
fear like fear is like I'm afraid I'm afraid like I have anxiety like I like
56:36
I'm afraid that I'll mess up I'm afraid that God will send wrath on me I'm a I'm
56:44
afraid no God did not give us a spirit of fear the Bible says so um that
56:51
there's a difference between adrenaline like because you feel the the seriousness of respecting God
56:59
and having reverence for God and obeying him there's a difference between that and like being
57:05
afraid so God doesn't want you to be afraid but he does want you to have
57:10
serious fear of God serious intense reverence and
Soul Ties
57:16
respect I felt that all friends had a soul tie and told someone this and that we had a soul tie since then I felt
57:22
oppression like I used to feel oppression was there danger in what I said accidentally what should I do
57:30
um I mean you should see Soul so there's good Soul TI and bad soul ties and you should see them
57:36
as the good ones you should see them as really from God and um like the really
57:42
close close friends that God re you really believe God has ordained very healthy very
57:50
Divine and then but like you'll have tons of friend I mean you may have several friends you may have
57:56
several acquaintances but you shouldn't see it as like you have ties with all these people there should only be really
58:02
good soul ties like David and Jonathan or just like this great love you have
58:08
for each other and you really are cheering one another on and really care
58:14
about each other and really want God's will to be done in each other's lives like that's that's a a good that is a tie
58:22
that's a good healthy Soul tie but it's just I mean it's just important
58:28
to not to not like overemphasize um ties and you know you
58:36
don't want to like open a door to the enemy for him to try to pervert it or
58:42
um like like be too attached to someone that God's not called you to be so
58:50
attached to you know like because you need to be following the holy spirit always and
58:56
um we can't be called to have like such Incredibly Close relationships in our
59:03
lives that are so many right so we just have to tread lightly with
59:09
um you know what we're like declaring this you are my David like if
59:15
I'm David you're my Jonathan or if I'm Jonathan you're my David we have to
59:21
tread lightly with that it's not really necessary to be like speaking
59:28
this you shouldn't be speaking it prematurely it's not like it has to be spoken most of the time you know what I
59:33
mean I mean you probably have found so many times in your lives that that some friendships were seasonal and some friendships um it's just how God wanted
59:40
it it maybe you moved to a different place maybe you moved to a different church and it it was seasonal but it's
59:46
no not a bad thing it was just seasonal right but maybe you were so close to a person in one season or also maybe um
59:53
someone had open doors to the enemy and you didn't realize that and all of a sudden things are exposed
59:59
about this person and that's why you're no longer friends with them so that's why I say it's it's just important to like tread
1:00:06
lightly with saying powerful words and um this could be a seasonal thing so
1:00:13
don't don't don't put more weight put more tie there where God wasn't calling
1:00:18
you to put tie you know it's just not it's not necessary to be like making things a big deal and
1:00:26
declaring things you know like this unless there's a time where God is
1:00:31
really calling you to yeah so um so yeah
1:00:36
so if they're if you're sensing you know maybe this isn't someone I was meant to really Proclaim I have this tie to and
1:00:45
um you know I don't know God's plans for our lives in terms of like how close we
1:00:51
will always remain I I don't I don't know so um I just just just to say I
1:00:57
surrender this relationship to God I Surrender it to God and um I I renounce
1:01:03
any unhealthy soul ties in jesus' name and let this relationship be pleasing to
1:01:12
God in Jesus name so I speak all oppression to leave in Jesus name from
1:01:21
you amen if you had to choose one is that is there a spiritual truth that is widely
1:01:27
overlooked or unheard of even in the new wine churches that you think is important one of them is um the
1:01:34
principle of authority the principle of people many Christians many churches they don't know how to really walk in
1:01:40
authority they don't know the laws and the spiritual about Authority they don't know the principles um because the devil
1:01:46
will fool around and mess around when you're not walking according to God's laws and
1:01:52
principles God's ways and so a lot of people our missing
1:01:57
Revelation about Authority really how to adequately walk
1:02:02
in authority not just personally but how it's supposed to look like in the Kingdom government of God how it's
1:02:08
supposed to look like in the church when we walk in at the right way that's when we are the most effective that's when
1:02:14
demons can't play around but they're forced to leave so we need not only the anointing but we need revelation of how
1:02:21
to walk in the anointing right according to God's ways
1:02:26
walking in Authority according to God's ways that's one of the big ones one of
1:02:32
the big ones yes yes Hallelujah and another one is humility
1:02:40
and Purity yeah it's it's um overlooked so
1:02:45
much it's overlooked so much as how important it is it's the
1:02:51
core of everything I praise God he's he's raising up Servants of God who are
1:02:57
pure and humble and he is opening eyes to see what real fruits look like not a
1:03:03
form of godliness but denying its power not talking the talk but not walking the
1:03:08
walk you know not but people that can see through people that can see through that it's a form of godliness but not
1:03:15
actual godliness that it's a it's a form of humility but not really humility it's a
1:03:20
form of Purity but not really Purity you know talking about it but not living it
1:03:28
God is opening eyes to see real fruit Real Purity real
1:03:35
humility real real anointed Servants of
1:03:41
God hallelujah hallelujah is this the one move of God
1:03:46
that God is doing in the world or he is is he doing other moves too well this is his Revival his end
1:03:53
time Revival and when we see
1:03:59
Jesus commissioning his disciples we see these disciples going into the world
1:04:06
and pioneering leading Revival and leading this move of God and so we see
1:04:14
Moses risen up commissioned anointed to lead the move of God that was the big
1:04:22
move of God that was happening at that time and God is in the business right now God is in the business right now of
1:04:29
transforming his bride the body of Christ the church he is in the business of restoring what has been lost in the
1:04:35
acts Church to the body of Christ he's in the business of restoring the fful ministry restoring the anointing
1:04:42
restoring deliverance and healing restoring the prophetic true prophetic the true prophets and true Apostles
1:04:50
restoring Purity um this is what he is doing now that's the big move he's is doing now
1:04:56
and he is moving through people in all sorts of ways so many people all
1:05:02
throughout the world so many Believers he is using he is moving through but when it comes to the the main move of
1:05:09
God like the big the big like the core of what he's doing I mean the church has
1:05:16
to be equipped that's everything flows from that the Believers have to be equipped
1:05:23
the Believers have to be shown the right way the Believers have to receive the new wine the Believers have to have
1:05:30
their eyes opened up the Believers have to get their old wine out the Believers for them to be doing what they
1:05:37
were called to do on this Earth for them to be be be used more powerfully by God how God created them to they have to be
1:05:46
equipped so the core of what God is doing all over the Earth Is His Revival
1:05:53
right now his Global Revival of transforming his church of restoring
1:05:58
what has been lost restoring the anointing the fful ministry Purity
1:06:04
Deliverance his miracles that's the core and so just like he raised up Peter Paul
1:06:12
the Disciples of Jesus he raises up servants to do this to lead this to
1:06:19
Pioneer this to release it to release the new wine to release the equipping to
1:06:24
release the spiritual food that will lead to others rising up to
1:06:29
then be able to equip others that will lead to others being equipped and anointed and sent out to be fful
1:06:36
ministers to equip the body so that's what he's doing now it's
1:06:41
the the main move the co it's it's where everything else flows from so that's why it is so important I speak so much so
1:06:48
much prophetically the importance of people accepting his move the importance
1:06:54
of leaders accepting his move spiritual leaders Christian leaders AC accepting his move the reason why God leads me to
1:07:01
speak on this so much because this is everything flows from this this move of God it's the core it's the church has to
1:07:08
get right the foundation has to get right for the body to be right for the
1:07:14
body to be equipped and to be whom God called them to be to be anointed so so many more souls will be
1:07:22
saved healed Delivered come into the kingdom in in this world when each believer is equipped to
1:07:31
be who they were created to be and they got to have the right equipping not the
1:07:36
old wine equipping not the um the equipping coming from not Purity and
1:07:44
Leadership you know that's not going to work
1:07:49
so this is why it is so important this is why God leads me to speak this so
1:07:54
this is why it is critical everything flows from it everything it's not about a Ministry
1:08:04
a church it's about the whole body of Christ it's about how God is helping
1:08:11
delivering opening eyes equipping the whole body of
1:08:19
Christ it's going to lead once once the church gets right once the church becomes transformed
1:08:25
the Believers are changed and transformed to be powerful vessels of God so many more souls will be saved and
1:08:34
come into the kingdom than currently are being saved and coming into the kingdom
1:08:40
this is critical to accept God's move
1:08:45
praise God I thank you Jesus for what you have done today this has been powerful how God has moved and I want to
1:08:51
pray over all of you right now I see God right right now
1:08:58
