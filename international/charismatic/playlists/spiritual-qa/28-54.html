0:00
if I'm having strong feelings of caring how my social media looks should I fast it but I also know that God wants us to
0:06
serve more than ever now um and so really what God wants where he wants
0:11
your heart to be is that like when it comes to social
0:17
media and your social media that you would have this passion for people to encounter Jesus on your page and that
0:23
would be purely it but that includes Excellence too um that you would have a heart to represent Jesus right with
0:30
excellence and just do anything in your power with the gifts God's given you
0:37
to show Jesus to the world you know um which that in you know a big reason why
0:43
Excellence is Excellence is important is because that's how people take things
0:50
like more seriously sometimes or maybe some people that wouldn't normally watch something they watch it like for example
0:57
if there's really bad audio or really bad video and like a video pops up on
1:03
someone's page it's going to be like most a lot of
1:09
a lot more people would just scroll past purely because of the quality
1:14
um where as if the quality was good a lot more people would might would end up
1:20
just like watching oh what is this let me just watch this that's just one example and that's just that translates
1:26
to everything everything like I at church at 5f church Excellence is so important
1:33
like the worship how the worship sounds how things look how the live streaming is going what the cameras are doing and
1:40
capturing and everything like even me I look overseeing it I'm just really paying
1:47
attention to De details of Excellence because I know this is how more people will be reached I know this great
1:55
importance of Excellence that if you don't have Excellence it can reach some people the go can reach some people the
2:01
the video the message can reach some people but with Excellence it will for sure reach more people and not just that
2:08
but people will take one more seriously like the message they have to say or the
2:15
video that pops up they will um they will see it as more like valuable where
2:21
we have this message of like like come to Jesus this is who Jesus is come come
2:28
believe in him receive from him that's our message right and so we want
2:34
people to take us seriously so that they actually listen to us so that they um
2:39
you know are more are more prone to put
2:44
a ear closer come check out you know what I mean that's why Excellence is so important because it translates to more
2:53
more people being saved because it translates to more eyes actually coming and looking and giving Jesus a a chance
3:00
amen all of that to say so like this question was you're caring really about your social how your social media looks
3:06
so that's not a bad thing if it's purely for the sake of Jesus but if it's in a
3:12
different way that's more of like in a selfish way that's more of like a stylistic way like oo I want it to look
3:20
so pretty just for your own self but if you're like oh I want it to look good
3:26
for Jesus I want it to look good so people maybe make take it more seriously then that's good you know so just it
3:34
depends on your heart just pay attention to your heart um if if you're finding
3:40
you're like being obsessed with how it's looking for example just in a selfish way then it would be important to fast
3:46
it but I shared this actually recently but I want to share it again I hear a lot of people saying this like oh I
3:52
missed the lives I miss the the teachings I miss the services because I I'm fasting social media that's not wise
4:00
what you should do is if you need to fast social media find a way that you can still be connected to the word of
4:07
God that you need it's your bread it's you you need this food this nourishment
4:14
so um find a way use your brain like for example here's an here's an example of
4:19
what you could do you could you could create a whole different social media account all you need is an email I think
4:25
U or a phone number and you literally only follow one person like you follow
4:30
the church or you f you know if you're following if you're a um Planet at fivefold church for example you follow
4:36
my account you follow 5f church and that's it you know so and and you only
4:41
go on that account you don't ever go on your other account where you're following all these other people and where you have your profile and
4:48
everything um that would be the wise way to go about fasting social media amen
4:54
yeah it's like the way you get the word of God today and the anointing the ma I
5:00
mean for everyone it's through the screen is one of the big ways even if you're living in La like the lives two
5:06
lives a week and even like the replay flourish it's all online so you don't
5:11
you want to make sure you're not fasting the word of God fasting the Bible fasting the anointing that's your daily
5:17
bread you need the anointing and the word of God daily and it's going to be harming you to fast those things we need
5:25
to be fasting the carnal things not the spiritual things tips on pacing yourself
5:31
with the work of God and serving amidst all the other things he has called you to do in your own personal life
5:39
so especially in this supersonic speed of Revival that God is taking us he's
5:44
really calling us all to sacrifice more than ever I mean even in my own personal life even though I I'm constantly you
5:52
know sacrificing to do the work of God but when flourish happened Revival wrecked my daily schedule you know like
6:00
my my day today has looked completely different having to create space for even more work of God a lot of it's
6:06
having to do with um really valuing what God did at flourish and and like like
6:14
letting the fruits be shown to te to prophesy to others to open others eyes
6:23
so that they can come and receive so like me personally I have this responsibility like I'm watching like
6:28
every testimony it I know it'll come to a point where I can't do that and that's okay and I have a team that's helping
6:35
you know but right now I've been really watching like every testimony um just to
6:41
make sure that I'm completely valuing what God did and like sh me like look at what Jesus did he did this and he did
6:48
this and he did this because the more we do that the more we Testify the more we show the fruit of Jesus the more we show
6:54
how amazing he is and what he's doing the more attention Jesus gets from
7:00
others you know the more people will hear will seek they can't deny they the
7:05
more their faith will be lifted you know the more expectation that will come so
7:11
it's so important so like my daily life the past like two weeks has been really
7:16
shifted because of this the shift that God took us on it required more
7:21
surrender it required more sacrifice and um for me it required like less like
7:27
downtime and that's okay that's I I remember in 2021 there was this shift and it was way because rest and downtime
7:34
is really important um regularly usually but then there will be certain times
7:39
where at the speed that God's going there has to be a sacrifice in that area and there's a Grace for it like um you
7:47
know you're not going to get burnt out because where normally maybe you would because of the grace that's on this it's
7:54
like God is calling you to go really fast here um and and because he's
8:00
calling you to go fast because he's calling you to sacrifice more there's a Grace where you're able to go faster
8:06
it's like he's literally pushing you faster but you have to agree to go faster with him you know I remember when
8:12
the Revival first broke out I was um well like all of the so it was just shocking the Miracles that God was doing
8:18
it was like I've never seen I've never seen Mass Deliverance like this I know so much of the world hadn't seen it
8:23
before it's when we were in the park and um you know like we didn't have live
8:28
streaming like we do now where we have camera Crews I mean we're in the park there's no Wi-fi you know no like
8:34
there's like there was like we were able to get like a couple Outlets like outside but you know it was all phone
8:40
recording so um it's phone recording is not good like live like it comes out
8:46
like not good quality you can't hear very well you can't get like close up it's not clear and as I said Excellence
8:52
is also important to God so um we would film with cameras and then um I would I
8:59
would like I remember like the next day that was on Sunday and then on Monday I would be editing and editing takes a
9:05
really long time when you're layer like layering and like two two three different camera angles or more and
9:11
matching the audio up and like it just takes a long time so I would
9:17
literally just not stop until it was done and so I there was several Mondays
9:23
after Sunday where I literally just stayed up the entire night and I I I was
9:29
up till 10:00 a.m. editing and then I would go to sleep for like 6 hours or so
9:35
um cuz I I I knew it was important to still like get sleep just even if it was looking differently like sleepy during
9:41
the day and then like I would go live with it or I sometimes I would I I had planned to go live or I would go live
9:47
with the um what I just edited once I like woke up like late afternoon or
9:53
evening and so like that wrecked my schedule it wrecked my life but in the best B way
10:00
Revival but I had so much joy more than ever before like doing the work of God just filled me with so much joy it it
10:07
became so much fun even I wasn't like feeling like this is so crazy and annoying the sacrifice I'm making being
10:13
up till 10:00 in the morning no like I was so Overjoyed like these were the promises of God being fulfilled and it
10:21
was just so exciting I knew the fruit that would come from it for for more people to see what God was doing and it's true it it made it I know like one
10:29
of those those videos that I was staying up probably till 10: a.m. doing I think um I think it was actually the first day
10:36
that 300 people came and it was mass Deliverance everywhere Revival broke out I think that YouTube video is titled um
10:44
Revival broke out one hour of continuous Miracles I think that's what I titled it
10:49
on YouTube and it has like I forget the amount of views but has several hundred
10:55
thousand views and that's like that's rare on YouTube especially for an hour video usually it's just one minute
11:01
videos that get 1 million views or some or several hundred thousand views but like like God man it's it's exciting
11:09
like in Revival to to step in line with God's supersonic speed um because it's
11:16
like with the more that you're doing in the Revival the more that God does like
11:23
He blesses the work of your hand so I was up till 10:00 in the morning you know editing that but it was more than
11:29
worth it like several hundred thousands of people have seen it now been blessed by it and it led to so many more people
11:36
coming so um yeah like last week I was um watching every testimony video and
11:46
um and then like Saturday God gave me this idea to just make this video like I
11:53
had gone live earlier that week you know like an hour more than an hour but God was like I I felt Holy Spirit nudge uh
12:00
leading me to make like a shorter video to just kind of like let the world know what God did like in a shorter version
12:07
because a lot of people aren't going to watch an hour version so and to do it before the week was over you know um to
12:13
really value what he had done and so I I did that and then as I started to just I
12:20
put it on my editing program and then I got that idea to like show what I was
12:25
talking about to add like a video of what I was talking about of like people being delivered people receiving importation and then that led to another
12:32
idea that led to another idea to add testimonies and I had seen all these amazing testimonies so it led me to the
12:39
idea of let me screenshot a little bit of this and a little bit of this and and several hours later before I had Sunday
12:46
service to minister at I mean it was like 2 amm before I went to bed and I have I also was preparing for the
12:52
message and everything and got less sleep than usually I would but I was so full of energy I was so full of energy
12:58
Sunday um even though it was less sleep than I would normally like to get you know because there was so much grace on it
13:04
and so anyways I just say all that to say um oh anyways I shared that I got to
13:10
share that that video on this past Sunday and I was so grateful to God for just leading me because I know it was
13:17
just really important and special for people to see like a glimpse of what God did um the story of what God did and um
13:27
so yeah so I just give you a little glimpse into like how just even personally my life is shifted and I just
13:32
like I just want that to translate for your life like this is what it looks like it's it's a different kind of life
13:39
it's a different it's a it's a more sacrifice but it's it's it's like more
13:45
exciting than ever to do the work of God and to make sacrifice because not only is it not in vain
13:52
but it's it's leading to a faster increase you know like it's God's like
13:57
ready to move and he's ready to your hand the work of your hands like never before he's ready to many times we're
14:03
sewing seeds and we don't see the fruit till a long time later you know but like right now it it's a time of
14:11
like quickness of seeing the work of our hands the the the the the fruit the
14:19
Harvest even even fast even soon after you know so anyways the question was
14:25
like how do we balance like doing more work of God and like with our own personal act daily life I would say it's
14:33
so important to take care of your personal um life like get enough sleep
14:39
um take care of yourself you know even this week I didn't I didn't get to
14:45
exercise the way I wanted the way I like to like but it's okay like it's just like certain sacrif like sleep and
14:52
exercise these things are important but like in certain times it's we don't have
14:58
to be religious about it and um you know you're not your body is not going to
15:03
start like deteriorating if you didn't get the five days of exercise but you
15:09
got like two or three for one week for example you know what I mean like I you have to kind of make this shift once in
15:15
a while as holy spirit's leading um so um and I mean part of that just has to
15:22
do with even like there's just so much work to be done it's like we have to
15:27
find time for more of this important to be done for the Kingdom so um make sure you're not neglecting yourself make sure
15:33
you're taking care of yourself like for me when I'm I I still like am like okay but I I want to make sure I can get like
15:41
good sleep still I'm not going to go overboard I'm not going to be like I'm fine I have the Holy Spirit so I just
15:48
will pull an all nighter I won't get any sleep it's important that you don't go to that extreme as I shared I was up
15:54
till 10:00 a.m. but I still slept for 5 to 6 hours usually like at least 6 hours or so you know so that you can it's it's
16:02
it's um a marathon not a Sprint but it's like we speed up the marathon in certain
16:08
points like it's like a quicker move but we a quicker run a quicker Pace but we
16:13
still have to realize it's a marathon so generally just keep that in your mind
16:18
like certain move with the Holy Spirit like right now God's asking everybody to
16:24
sacrifice more in all areas for his work contributing to his work so that because God's ready to go faster
16:31
so he needs all of us to do more so that that translates to speed to speed that
16:37
he wants to go um but at the same time don't disqualify yourself don't burn out that you can't even run the race and you
16:43
can't do your part one of my Spanish speaking friends wants to know how to know when someone is free um does
16:49
something have to fall back like when you are ministering um well it's the anointing
16:56
that destroys the Yol that's the most important thing um especially like you know when you'll know them by their
17:01
fruits so if you're finding a Ministry that there's just testimony after testimony after testimony after
17:08
testimony [Music] um of Deliverance and like demons going
17:14
quickly and like not a struggle um you know you're just seeing that you're
17:20
knowing that the anointing indeed is working you're knowing that truly the power of God is there and demons don't
17:29
win there you know and so what that is is it's the Bible in action it's like
17:37
when Jesus cast out a demon the demons didn't stand a chance they had to go his word would not return void um when the
17:45
disciples the apostles and the acts Church were casting out demons the demons had to go there was not a
17:52
struggle um that's just how it was we don't find it being this like huge
17:57
struggle I mean the disciples were growing in the anointing at one time but they hadn't
18:03
been like commissioned by Jesus fully to um go into the world yet I mean they
18:10
were still being like trained by Jesus so their anointing was not huge yet it
18:15
was growing in them and there was one time in the Bible where they couldn't cast out a certain demon the demon had a
18:21
higher demonic power but but when it came time for them to be really launched into Ministry when they had grown you
18:28
don't find any examples in the Bible of the Demons struggling so what I'm speaking of is
18:34
rare today but it's it's real it's out there Revival is now so like a five-fold
18:40
church this is what we're seeing take place and there's even you can even see it sometimes by the physical
18:46
manifestations that the demons have to obey you can see even physically
18:53
sometimes um by all of a sudden the person becomes still and comes to or
18:58
they fall back and they become still like maybe they were screaming or weeping or shaking before and then as
19:03
soon as the command is issued the the Weeping stops or the screaming stops or the physical manif stop manifestation
19:11
stop or they become still then often times there's such a wild Joy like never
19:17
before and it's beautiful because you can literally see like someone has been in prison and they're feeling the height
19:23
of the bondage in prison as the demons are just trying so hard to keep them in
19:30
prison right before they're delivered like as Jesus is walking with his keys to the door like the demons are like
19:38
constricting more on the person like no I don't want you to leave this prison as
19:44
Jesus comes close that's like when a person comes close to the anointing and so the person many times
19:50
they feel such discomfort like never before because the demons are afraid and trying hard to stop but
19:59
they can't they're just trying and that's when you're feeling like sometimes people are like ah like I can't breathe like they're feeling the
20:05
demons like latching on for dear life they're sometimes they're they look like they're in discomfort you know sometimes
20:12
or sometimes it looks can looks like something even hurt sometimes just right before they're being delivered because
20:17
the demons they're about to leave and the demons are mad it's not always but just sometimes you see that and then
20:24
Jesus comes that he unlocks the key and the person who's been in bondage for many years or maybe their whole life
20:31
it's like they walk it's like it's like they're in a dungeon Jesus opens the key
20:36
they see Jesus face to face maybe even for the first time look in his eyes he grabs their hand and walks up the steps
20:45
out of the dungeon out of the dark smelly cold dungeon of of demonic bondage and pulls them out
20:52
into the fresh air and the Sunshine for the first time and it's like it's 70 de
20:58
GRE and smells beautiful and it's the Sun beats on your face like imagine how
21:05
you would feel if you were in literal prison like that maybe you never even experienced Freedom before you never
21:10
experienced sunshine on your face and the breeze and the warmth and the the good smells that you know and on top so
21:18
on top of that Jesus is holding your hand and looking at you as your experience Freedom like imagine how you
21:23
would feel that's like what it's like when someone's set free when you're seeing that wild rejoicing that's like
21:31
not normal not natural Supernatural when someone's like jumping as high as
21:37
physically possible and like like their face is smiling so big like the biggest
21:42
in their life and they're they're screaming for Joy that's what they're
21:47
experiencing that's what they're experiencing so anyways like there's there's such evidence where where like
21:54
like a fold Church there's such evidence so you should know the the anointing is real here it's the Bible come alive here
22:02
just as it was in the time of Jesus where the demons have to go um you should have that kind of Faith by the
22:08
fruits by the fruits you'll know them so you see the fruits so then like when a person comes they should know I'm going
22:14
to get if I you know if you have bondage I'm going to get delivered here because this power of God is real because demons
22:21
have to obey here and that's it and so if I command a demon to go I'm not looking for physical manifestation
22:28
sometimes there's there's no physical manifestation but indeed the demon has left because the anointing is real and
22:35
the principles of God are real like how demons cannot stay where the anointing is and where the true authority of
22:41
Christ is being executed the word of God cannot return void so I'm never like
22:47
concerned ministering like I don't know if that demon left that person oh I wonder I didn't see a physical
22:53
manifestation so I really wonder I hope the demon left that person I'm never
22:58
thinking that like I have faith in Jesus his power and his principles there's no
23:05
like question um so now we the people have do
23:10
have a part to play like you have to believe and you have to grab the miracle you have to like the demon has gone and
23:16
you have to believe it whether you felt a physical manifestation or not so you and the physical manifestation of
23:23
Freedom will manifest like you'll see the fruit you'll see wow I'm really free
23:28
um day later sometimes or 2 days later or 3 days later or a week later or longer sometimes sometimes the anointing
23:35
is working in you like medicine and you don't notice the difference immediately but
23:40
you will if you remain in faith if you walk it out if you walk your Miracle out like so you you walk out that Faith like
23:48
the word was spoken whether it was one-on-one or whether it was to everybody like uh a corporate prayer
23:54
like the word was declared and I have faith you know if if if Jesus was here
24:00
physically and he spoke everybody here they all must be healed they all must be
24:05
free like you would believe right you would like Jesus said it
24:12
like but but Jesus is here we just don't see him physically he's a spirit but that's more real even Than
24:19
Physical his power is here he is here and so and he uses vessels and he's given us the authority and then he he
24:26
backs us up he causes his ve he he he he tell he he has his vessels he tell
24:32
instructs his vessels to speak to execute the authority and then as they do that he comes in power and so you
24:40
really need to have that kind of faith that it truly is Jesus here it truly is Jesus speaking through the vessel like
24:47
it truly is Jesus's power coming through the vessel and making the words to not return
24:52
void so it's so important that you have that faith and that you are not looking
24:58
for anything physical or you're not wondering did the demon go it needs to be more simple in your heart this is
25:05
true anointing this is this is what I read about in the Bible the demons have to leave so that when I go to that
25:12
church you know when I attend that live stream that word that's spoken it must happen in my life just simple period
25:18
like it just must happen I'm not you don't look for a physical manifestation you don't wonder you don't test is the
25:24
demon gone I don't know you believe the demon had to have left or the miracle had to have happened the healing had to
25:31
have happened because your faith is such a big part of it so you need to exercise your faith and partner with God in what
25:38
he's already done in the spirit to see it stay and
25:44
manifest completely how do I know where God wants me to be planted when he led me to your ministry but also to a local
25:50
church where with anointed leaders in the city I live in and I receive from God through both churches so you can
25:57
only have one Elijah only one Elijah only one and we
26:05
are called to be planted in one place now there are going to be several anointed ministers out there there's not
26:11
as many right now because this is a new wine that God has brought But as time
26:17
goes on there's going to be more and more and more and more true five-fold ministers that are anointed and really
26:23
carrying the fruits but when that time comes God still wants you to be planted in one place you know you you still have
26:31
to be PL planted under your Elijah Paul talks about Timothy Paul wasn't the only
26:36
fivefold minister at that time remember he joined the other Apostles he joined
26:42
the other fivefold ministers and but but he speaks specifically about Timothy being his
26:48
faithful spiritual son who he loved dearly who he trusted dearly who is faithful so and and and therefore
26:55
Timothy was like Elisha and Paul was like Elijah and so if you're being
27:00
Buffet even if it's just two places you you are missing the principle
27:06
the principle God doesn't go against his principles of being planted in one place
27:11
which is where he is calling you to like under your Elijah God doesn't go against his
27:17
principles so you can still be receiving so much benefits you can still be
27:22
growing closer to Jesus but when it comes to receiving the amount of an
27:28
anointing that God wants in your life um and receiving the amount of wisdom that
27:35
God wants in your life because God calls you to one place and
27:42
there's a prophetic anointing moving specifically for those who are called there like it it's supernatural it's
27:48
hard to understand or comprehend but it's like like I've heard so many testimonies of you know those of you
27:54
that are planted I've heard so many of your testimonies like every single subscriber Q&A and every single live or every single Sunday it was literally
28:01
what you needed to hear exactly like that week that day like it it's hard to
28:06
comprehend it's hard it doesn't make sense like how could this be true for like so many people but it is you know
28:12
and so that principle works when you're planted in one place and that's what I
28:17
mean where you really grow in wisdom you grow in Clarity because you are getting
28:22
it's like I don't know much about like Fitness training and everything but this example just kind of came to my mind
28:28
mind let's say you're like with a one trainer and they have you on this like
28:34
plan um to reach this goal or something um and it's very detailed and you just
28:40
do it every day and you see the goal reached because you just stayed committed to that one plan there can be
28:47
another great like fitness plan or whatever but if you're like mixing both
28:52
it it can kind of like bring confusion and and it's like doing too much and
28:58
it's it's the lack of focus the lack of just being focused and and being strict
29:05
to the the one can lead to not getting to that result that you want I don't know much about Fitness but it's an
29:11
example that came to mind and that's what I mean like there's there can be good great teaching
29:19
multiple places but in terms of the most amount of growth and wisdom and Clarity
29:26
and also your assignment is important for you to be in one place also
29:32
um Elisha received the mantle from Elijah so Elijah had a specific calling
29:37
from God a specific assignment and Elisha had like the same assignment and
29:43
calling Joshua had the same assignment and calling as Moses Moses's assign assignment and calling was to lead the
29:50
Israelites to the promised land to be the voice of God and to be the vessel of God to perform
29:56
Miracles uh and the voice of go the voice of God to provide direction for the people to get them all in one Accord
30:03
United and to be able to get into the promised land they both had the same calling
30:12
Moses took them from A to B Joshua took them from B to C but it was that same
30:18
line from bondage to the promised land
30:23
so Joshua received that same mantle for that same assignment and he needed to grow in that wisdom and
30:30
equipping he need like Moses had to have a certain kind of wisdom to lead the
30:36
Israelites to the promised land he had to have a certain kind of wisdom to lead them he he had to have that
30:42
understanding for example that they have this slavery mindset and how
30:48
to help them help them overcome that he had to have that understanding that um
30:55
they were lacking in faith lots of times he had to have that understanding of
31:01
like speaking firmly sometimes like why stop worshiping false gods you know
31:07
like there was something specific a specific wisdom that Moses carried that
31:12
God gave him a special Grace to have that wisdom to be able to complete that assignment so that wisdom was imparted
31:19
to Joshua Joshua walking with Moses and even getting to know what that calling
31:25
was that Moses had seen firsthand you know he saw for his hand how the people were he saw how Moses was led by God to
31:33
lead the people to correct the people to equip the people he was on the the
31:39
Battlegrounds with him you know like he was he was on the field with him for a
31:44
long time um and so all of that led to Joshua
31:50
being able to really perform his calling like really walk out his purpose in the
31:56
fullness you know he had the he had the impartation of the anointing he had the equipping that Moses
32:03
had and that's how he was able to do his job that's how he was able to complete this assignment so people have different
32:11
assignments in the body of Christ you know and like like this assignment that that
32:18
God's given a five full church I know it's so unique I know it's so unique and I know there's a special Revelation that
32:24
God's released here um so I know that that it's important for like you have
32:31
this assignment too so it's important for you to be on the field like Joshua was with
32:38
Moses and not leave and not miss something not miss something that you need to see you need to learn you need
32:44
to hear and also not get other stuff mixed in that's keeping you from
32:51
being built up for like it's like um you can only eat so much you have a steak
32:58
you have a you have a nice meal a steak and a salad and mashed
33:04
potatoes and you have um on this side you have a chicken and you have um
33:10
cooked vegetables and you have um sweet potato or something right they're both beautiful meals they're both great meals
33:17
can you fit both meals into your stomach though so God needs you to have let's
33:24
say the steak and the mashed potatoes and the salad like that's Joshua taking in
33:31
everything from Moses so he needs that he needs those nutrients that's coming from that food he needs the entire plate
33:39
not half of it but if you're taking half of the plate that has the chicken and
33:45
the sweet potatoes and the cooked vegetables you eat half of that and you eat half of the steak now at face value
33:52
that's like it seems even better it's like The Best of Both Worlds because personally even me like that I just
33:58
created like a yummy meal for for myself like I like I really like
34:03
potatoes but I also like mashed potatoes and I really like I probably prefer steak over chicken but I like them both if it's like barbecue got some barbecue
34:09
on there probably it's like almost equal you know and I love cooked veggies the best
34:15
if they're the best kind but if it's a salad the way I like it like so maybe some candied pecans and the right kind
34:21
of salad dressing and maybe some kind of cheese like maybe goat cheese maybe maybe blue cheese I'm not a huge blue
34:26
cheese but sometimes it tastes good except but like
34:31
that so it feels like man this is even
34:37
better but God needed you to have just the steak plate and instead you got half
34:44
the steak plate so you as Joshua is half equipped and then you're half equipped
34:51
to do a different assignment that God didn't call you to that that's what it looks like in the spiritual Realm
35:02
that also translates also to contributing to the work of God because wherever God calls you to be planted he wants you to contribute he wants to
35:08
contribute with your hands with um serving him um with uh uh uh
35:16
sewing um and so if you're giving half of that if Joshua's giving half of that
35:22
to Moses guess what Moses is lacking Moses is not receiving the help he needs and that God called him to have help
35:28
because remember the Bible says Joshua was a servant of Moses not Joshua was a servant of two people two servants of
35:35
God so it's negatively impacting actually the work of God God wants people all in and fully trained so that
35:42
they're all at the full capacity not half capacity to do the work of God God wants that for this ministry here and
35:49
God wants that for this ministry here and this ministry for here he doesn't want like one amazing Ministry and
35:55
another minist amazing Ministry over here and they're like they're half
36:00
they're half in here and they're half in here so you got a bunch of halfin people half equipped people H H for that
36:07
specific assignment I'm saying that's what that's the real meaning and it's a spiritual thing that
36:12
I'm speaking like it's a spiritual thing that happens a spiritual principle that happens you're God calls you to one
36:21
assignment one one purpose like in terms of his work you need to be a professional when it comes to
36:28
the word of God the prophetic word of the Rama word of God that God wants speaking this new wine that God's speaking you need to be a professional
36:34
not just like halfway having the knowledge and wisdom about it and this
36:40
is what makes the impartation of anointing come upon your life when you follow these principles it makes the anointing come upon your life more not
36:48
just halfway it makes it come upon your life more
36:54
so seek God with where he wants you to be
36:59
planted and that's going to how will you know where to be planted where you've
37:04
seen the most fruits in your life and also where your heart is lit up
37:10
more also where you feel in the spirit pulling you like you feel this pull you
37:16
feel the Holy Spirit speaking to
37:24
you you also have to hear the word of God like what God is is doing right now this new thing that he's doing you have
37:30
to say God is calling all of his people to be part of this revival this end time
37:37
Revival so um you know if if if you can
37:43
at this time it's going to look different God's going to call some people to be when they live in a different city or country he'll call
37:49
them to just be completely online and not attend a local church other times
37:55
you might feel it's okay like to attend a local church but you know where you're
38:00
really planted like like if God's calling you to be planted at fful church for example and you don't live in the city of La but you know God's calling
38:07
you to be planted there so when you are going to another church it's the purpose more of a a
38:14
uh opening eyes many times uh sharing testimony because the anointing is rare
38:19
many people are not receiving Deliverance healing the power of God impartation so maybe God can have you
38:25
there for a season of a a purpose of planting seeds of sharing testimony of
38:30
what God's doing um but to know it's not like okay I'm receiving here and I'm
38:36
receiving here know where you're really receiving like know where God has called you to really receive know if he's
38:42
called you to eat the steak plate or the chicken plate amen do you have a story to share
38:49
about your experience with your spiritual father how do you tune into his teachings I was actually just thinking about him and I want wanted to
38:54
share about even my own experience in this the way that I've
39:00
grown the way I've grown to be mature and strong and like the the
39:09
way the word has grown in me the way that I can receive Revelation from God and the way I can speak the word that
39:16
glory to God God opens up people's eyes and really equips them and builds them and it's prophetic and it's you know the
39:24
way I've grown spiritually caring the the meat the the Mysteries the secrets of
39:31
the Mysteries of the spiritual real the the secrets of the
39:36
anointing it's by doing what I just taught you it's by choosing the steak
39:45
plate really really I I I I stayed focused I
39:50
didn't go listening here there reading this book this book this book I stayed focused what I needed what I need like I
39:59
I I didn't need anything else God needed me to say Focus be planted receive from my Elijah my spiritual father Prophet Dr
40:05
JV is my Elijah and he carries this W great wisdom like I've never seen
40:15
anywhere and prophetic eye into the spiritual
40:21
realm I mean I I couldn't want for anything it's like such a high level
40:28
high level wisdom you know um but above all like
40:34
God was just calling me to receive from there so for me I I'm a unique case I'm
40:40
a I'm a unique case like usually one would be planted at a church and they're
40:46
receiving the teachings but for me like according to my calling is a very unique
40:54
situation where it wasn't like God was calling me to learn Swahili language and like listen to all this the messages but
41:02
I have spoken to my spiritual father again and again he preaches to me on the phone I in English He Speaks really good
41:08
English He preaches to me on the phone I've I've I've talked to him consistently I've heard the word of God
41:15
from him consistently on almost a daily basis for
41:23
years now it's been it'll be eight years I've been his spiritual daughter this
41:31
September constantly growing constantly learning constantly eating the steak
41:37
plate constantly eating that meal that one
41:42
meal and that's one of the big secrets of how I've grown in the
41:51
anointing in the anointing to cast out demons to receive that mighty impartation
41:57
and to teach with the anointed word and
42:03
teach with authority and grow in Revelation I am I do not preach
42:10
like I preached a year ago I do not preach like I preached two years ago I do not preach like I preached seven
42:15
years ago for sure I think a lot of you would be really shocked how I preached seven years ago six years ago
42:23
um that's a secret I don't teach random things I don't teach you I teach you my
42:30
life I teach you from experience that's why I I speak passionately I speak firmly I don't speak timidly I I I speak
42:38
new wine boldly with courage because I've lived
42:45
it I've tested it I mean not that I need to test it but like I've tasted and seen
42:51
this is true what I'm saying it's up to you to take the word to value the word
42:58
but I'm telling you I've lived what I'm teaching what I just taught you the past
43:04
like 15 minutes or 20 minutes whatever about being planted I have lived that 100 not 90%
43:15
I've lived that 100% for seven and a half almost eight
43:21
years now so you be the judge the Bible says
43:27
imitate me is I imitate Jesus like if you if you like what you see in my life
43:32
if you want to see that kind of spiritual growth and wisdom and maturity and even uh and the
43:39
anointing imitate me as I imitate Jesus amen like take the words I say seriously
43:45
even if it's such new wine you've never heard it before God's doing a new thing those who
43:52
will receive the word those who will receive this that I'm sharing they are
43:57
the ones that will grow they are the ones who will become leaders they are the ones who will be so powerfully
44:04
anointed people will wonder why them why them why not me because they valued the
44:10
word they were good soil for the word to come up come on to fall on so they were
44:17
able to grow they were able to receive it takes humility it takes
44:25
surrender how should we respond to a homosexual person who's offended by a video posted about being delivered of
44:32
homosexuality or should we respond the Bible says that the things of the spirit
44:37
are foolish to the carnal man and so on the topic of homosexuality the fact
44:43
that God has really created man and woman to be man and woman in every
44:49
aspect of that meaning of the word um and to you know not have sexual desires and
44:57
in relations with the same sex god hasn't created it to be that way
45:03
that that um that's a thing of the spirit that's
45:09
foolish to the carnal mind okay so when you find someone
45:15
finding something foolish of the spirit you can really know they have a carnal
45:21
mind they at least have a carnal mind in that area maybe they're spiritual in other areas but they have a carnal mind
45:28
in that area their spiritual eyes there's many different layers to your spiritual eyes many different layers right like you can be a really spiritual
45:36
in one area you can be really spiritual in the fact that g you know you believe that Jesus is our Lord and
45:46
savior 100% not 99% you believe that you see that one can see that well they are
45:54
very spiritual in that area but in a million different other areas of
46:02
the spiritual realm of different things of the spirit they could be completely blind or maybe they're halfway blind
46:09
halfway spiritual so that's what we're that's the world we're living in in the body of Christ we're living in a world
46:16
where it's rare to have spiritual maturity and spiritual eyesight we're living in the world like Paul
46:23
says I want to give you meat so you should be able to teach others but you're still needing milk so we're
46:29
having so many babies that you know babies can't comprehend and understand how adults can we have so many spiritual
46:37
babies who can't comprehend and understand the things of the spirit they don't see they just can't see the truth
46:45
that's the world we're living in we got to accept that and don't feel bad about it and don't wonder how can they not see
46:52
and we also can't force it so just walk with wisdom knowing like you can't Force someone's eyes to be open the kindness
46:59
of God leads to repentance um just be kind to them you don't have to force it to them um eyes
47:06
are opened with humility as when when when when the disciples first came back
47:12
from casting out demons Jesus says I praise you father for hiding these things the revelation of your Authority
47:18
so it also could mean for hiding the things of the spirit the revelations of the spirit I praise you for for hiding
47:24
the revelations of the spiritual Realm to those who are proud and carnal and
47:29
for only revealing it to those who are childlike and humble so when one is childlike and humble they will have a
47:36
heart to understand maybe they're like wait I just really don't I really you know someone who's childlike and humble
47:42
they will see verses in this in the scripture like how God created man and woman and he said um
47:50
multiply that was the direction create men create woman multiply so he's saying sleep with one another create children
47:58
like that's a command you know he didn't say unless you feel that you want to sleep with the
48:05
same sex in that case you won't be able to create so I'm saying this for just those of you that have that that sexual
48:12
desire towards the opposite sex like you know like God said that okay number one
48:17
and number two there's verses that say that um sleeping having sexual
48:23
relations with the same sex is a sin you know so if a Christian is humble and
48:28
childlike they will see those scriptures and even if they don't understand it and they don't agree with it they will at
48:34
least be humble about it they will at least be like I don't understand this like the Bible says this but like this
48:42
doesn't make sense to me because these people are having these feelings since they were a young child it's like they
48:48
were born with it so I don't understand but maybe when they see a testimony
48:53
video of someone being delivered of um homosexuality lifestyle
48:59
and um feelings and thoughts um maybe they're like maybe
49:04
they strike up a conversation with you like I don't understand this like they said this happened but I see all these
49:10
people in my life that they have these strong feelings since they were a kid and then we have the scripture I don't understand you know
49:18
like do you understand this and that's a time where you can then that's a time
49:24
where someone's humble childlike and they're open they're open for their eyes to be
49:30
opened and so that's a time where you know okay God right now is using me to at least plant seeds for their eyes to
49:36
be opened that's a time where you can explain what you've learned you can explain what you've learned what you see
49:43
in the spiritual realm how you see there's such a demonic influence on people in so many different areas and
49:49
that includes in their thoughts in their feelings even in their sexual feelings there can be a demonic influence there
49:56
even can come in at a young child that even can come in through um when
50:02
someone's abused by the same sex maybe and then afterwards you know maybe let's
50:09
say some they were touched in their sexual areas and they felt something because that's just natural for the body
50:16
to like feel something if a touch there and then then the person immediately thinks well because I like felt
50:21
something then you know I guess that means I'm this or even if they didn't
50:27
feel something the devil can speak immediately bring he will immediately
50:32
strategically bring thoughts like um of of of like this happened to you
50:40
because this is who you're supposed to be or immediately start giving sexual thoughts in that area because a person
50:47
of the same sex did sexual things to them the Devil comes with that thought being like yep that's right you know
50:52
this is what's right and this is who you are and devil the devil brings these
50:58
lies and people don't realize that it's the devil and so they think that any kind of feeling or thought they have is
51:03
the truth so your eyes have been open up to all these things right and so you know the root of it is the enemy and is
51:09
lies and demonic oppression and the more we open up doors the stronger it comes the stronger the oppression comes so
51:17
someone can be 100% sure they are homosexual because they've kept opening
51:22
up doors and it's those feelings and thoughts and sexual um sexual
51:29
feelings sexual attractions have become even stronger you know so you can have
51:35
that kind of conversation with somebody and also share testimonies with them like listen I've seen these testimonies
51:40
at fivefold church I've seen I've heard testimonies from other people you know
51:45
and then that can really open up a person's eyes or it can at least plant seeds maybe if they're not ready to fully receive and have their eyes opened
51:52
up but that's the time to talk about it but if they're not open just it's they're not ready to receive
51:59
it so don't push it and just instead treat them with love treat them with kindness and just if it's a testimony of
52:05
someone sharing this is what happened to me and I'm happy and blessed
52:10
like there's nothing to be offended about or wrong I mean it's it's that person's testimony so they're fully so
52:19
you're not doing anything wrong by sharing a testimony you know there's nothing for you to feel bad about and that person really needs really should
52:27
you know respect a person's own testimony so you don't need to feel bad about it you don't need to feel like you
52:33
offended someone just bless them be kind to them if it's someone close in your life you may need to put up boundaries
52:39
if they're you know going against your faith so much like at your fa in your face should Christian men be more
52:46
selective about going on dates uh yeah well God only wants you to
52:51
be with someone who's equally yolked and so um
52:57
you should get to know someone as a friend first and even if you
53:02
have romantic feelings or whatever feelings about the person you should um
53:09
really try not to dwell on those and not go there yet especially because we're we
53:14
are human and we are human we are not like
53:20
100% spirit and so we want to make sure that the feelings are pleasing to God we
53:26
want we we don't want to jump ahead of the wisdom of God and God's directions by leaning too much into our feelings so
53:34
try to not focus or dwell on those feelings and try to really get to know the person as a
53:40
friend and um usually at least at first
53:46
in in more of a group type of environment um especially so you can
53:52
really stay focused more on the person as like as a friend not in a romantic
53:57
way and you know when you have that surrendered heart God will open your eyes and show you like this would be an
54:03
equally yolked person like this is a safe person this is you know this is a
54:09
truly surrendered person with a pure humble heart and so once that's revealed and once um time has passed things
54:18
aren't rushed because of feelings intense feelings um then it could be a time with
54:25
the Holy SP Spirit leading uh
54:31
to take a person take take her on a date for example um or ask you know
54:40
um but it it depends like how also how close you are I mean how serious you are
54:47
serving in the work of God you should also be open with your spiritual parent
54:52
if you're like serving really close to the anointing it's like you have to take everything even more seriously like I
54:58
want to make sure I'm not going by my feelings you know you want to just be open you know you don't want to hide
55:04
things you just want to be open to really do everything you can to make sure you're being in God's Will and
55:10
really being led by the Holy Spirit and a lot of that can have to do also with the timing of God like if go if God
55:16
wants you to be just you know how we're going super
55:23
sonic speed in this revival for example like there can be certain season where the timing is not right yet simply
55:28
because of what God is calling you to do to do in his kingdom in his work and that's why I said it's important to be
55:34
really sensitive to the Holy Spirit and really make sure you're really being led by him to make sure timing's right when
55:40
it comes to these things what type of boundaries we should have should we have with family members that are not
55:45
Believers in regards of spending time with them like friends or blood sisters and brothers that you love
55:53
so it's very important to see yourself very important in the kingdom like I
55:58
have this assignment it is very serious and I have to protect this anointing and
56:03
I have to keep this fire and I have to stay focused and I have to like manage
56:09
my time perfectly like if God's calling me to do this this this and this this and this and this I have to make sure I
56:16
have time to do all of that so you make that priority you make keeping your fire
56:22
protecting the anointing and doing the work of God um and and receiving the
56:27
word of God like so you can keep growing you make all of that priority that's number one and then everything else will
56:33
fall into place if you can keep that like to know like you are not you are not obliged
56:42
to um spend a certain amount of time with like family members it's what God is speaking over your life that's the
56:48
only thing that matters you need to really keep that in your heart because people in in they have their culture
56:54
they have their traditions and then they have their feeling feelings and you can't let that get in the way of what
57:00
God's asking you to do and you can't like feel guilty about what God is calling you to do you know what I mean I
57:06
mean um like like I
57:14
um I I love my family I all of my family is in Upstate New York um my grandma is
57:21
there she's in her late 80s my I have I have an aunt and uncle that are there
57:28
and cousins and um I have a couple other more distant like not as like uh close
57:34
like the first degree close family that's like in other states like Virginia and Ohio but when it comes to
57:41
like um like my sister my brother my brother-in-law my niece and nephews
57:48
they're in Upstate New York as well and um before before um God called me to
57:56
this calling I came out to Los Angeles and I came out here originally for acting and then and then I moved into
58:03
pursuing music singing and songwriting and um I would you know go home to or
58:10
home like Upstate New York to see family at least twice a year and to see all of them to spend
58:17
time with all of them and then um when God called me to this ministry I to this
58:24
calling I would have loved to go home at least one year to like spend quality time with
58:30
all of them but God was speaking to me right now in this
58:36
season my work is priority my work his work is priority I
58:42
sacrificed going home for Christmas for all of those years
58:48
for um I don't know how many years just basic Whatever Whenever I started
58:55
fivefold Church I never went home for Christmas since that cuz God wanted me there for the Christmas Eve
59:01
service um even when there was just like five of us or even when we had to do it
59:08
online um one time streaming it um I I never went home
59:15
since when was it 20 like Christmas 2017 so I think 20 Christmas 2016 was my last
59:22
time for Christmas at home and that was like one of the most special times for me was having Christmas at home with my
59:28
family and Christmas Eve service singing hymns with my parents and I had to
59:33
sacrifice that God asked me to and um I now live in a nice apartment I live in a
59:39
nice apartment now but I didn't live in such a nice apartment um until uh 2021
59:46
20 uh fall 2021 um because financially I I I I I I didn't have hard
59:55
like any money hardly any money um it was just my parents helping me so I was living like
1:00:01
bare minimum because I didn't want to and they couldn't I mean I didn't want to ask them too much I just asking them
1:00:07
for the bare minimum um and so I mean that includes just like even if I'm
1:00:13
getting a meal somewhere it's like I'm only getting water I'm not I'm just getting like like looking at the prices
1:00:18
of the menu like that was the life I was living for the first um like three and a
1:00:25
half years of the ministry of of having the church um so my Christmas was spent um I
1:00:33
would go over to joh tall's place and she had a little nicer place than I did and um at the time but where I was and
1:00:41
oh and her parents her parents place was nice so where I was um though I would
1:00:46
spend part of my Christmas in my apartment that wasn't so nice I mean it wasn't like horrible but um it wasn't in
1:00:53
the greatest area of town just cuz of affordability reasons and um it was just
1:00:59
a really basic two bedroom just not very nice um I mean it was fine you know but
1:01:06
it got the job done but my point is is like I couldn't spend Christmas and like
1:01:12
my nice the nice home with my family you know that was a sacrifice God was asking me to make um and so my niece is
1:01:19
graduating um High School uh this June
1:01:24
and I just booked flights um last night to go to Upstate New York to be there
1:01:30
for her graduation I won't miss any Sunday it's just like going to be during the week the days during the week um and
1:01:38
this is going to be my first time going home I mean going to Upstate New York this is my home now in LA but my my
1:01:44
family's home my parents home it's going to be my first time since
1:01:50
2021 I went home January right like the week after the video went viral which
1:01:58
led to Revival breaking out so two months before the first demon was cast out I surprised my mom I wasn't there
1:02:04
for Christmas but I came like in January after and but I still didn't miss a Sunday just came home for a few days
1:02:10
that was the last time I was there that's the last time I so my my nephews like have low voices now it's so crazy
1:02:17
like they're Teena they're uh they're like te all teenagers now and last time
1:02:24
I saw them they were not that way so um yeah I mean that's a sacrifice God asked
1:02:29
me to make so I just give that example of um put put Jesus first and everything
1:02:36
else will fall into place it's going to also depend like if you have family members that aren't equally yolked then
1:02:42
that's going to mean that God's not wanting you to spend usually as much like time because that's not going to be
1:02:49
Iron sharpening iron and helping to feel your fire and it's probably going to be a distraction of where you're ending up
1:02:55
not doing so many things fruitful for the kingdom we need to minister to our family but it's usually not going to
1:03:01
look like tremendous hours per day like ministering to our family usually will
1:03:06
be more useful for the kingdom planting seeds but being the brightest light in
1:03:12
our own lives for them to look and see rather than spending all this time with
1:03:17
them that we're not able to spend time doing the work of God or um you know
1:03:23
growing in the Lord and and kind our fire amen so and then also there's going
1:03:28
to be also people who there might be family members who are completely against Jesus or maybe they're religious
1:03:36
and they're completely against Jesus in his new wine Jesus in this revival and
1:03:41
if they're adamantly against Jesus like continually like they just continue to
1:03:49
speak against Jesus against his anointing against his anointed servants um that's going to be D dous for your
1:03:56
spiritual health I mean that's going to be it's the opposite of fueling into fan
1:04:01
your the the fire that's in within you it's going to really be like dampening unnecessarily upon you um upon your
1:04:11
spirit and and and an open door just for the enemy's words to be speaking to you so much so Jesus said I didn't come to
1:04:18
bring peace but I came to bring division where there will be a sword between uh I mean
1:04:26
uh uh parents and children will be against each other and really the meaning of that is is that in some cases
1:04:32
there will be some parents who do not accept Jesus and there will be some children who do accept Jesus and so
1:04:39
there's going to be a clashing there because of the parents Free Will decision and so
1:04:47
um the meaning of bringing div vision is like sometimes there needs to be
1:04:52
boundaries set in place for your spiritual health and protection and you standing up for Jesus and you being
1:04:58
unashamed for Jesus you standing up for your faith and standing strong so it's going to look like a a whole different
1:05:04
thing sometimes it can be complete huge boundaries put in place like in these
1:05:09
situations in other areas it can be like a family memb is kind of lukewarm so they're not
1:05:15
[Music] um it's not wise to spend like too much time with them that it's it's it's it's
1:05:23
not helping you grow amen hallelujah just depending but then there
1:05:30
can be a family member who is very spiritual equally yolked and you can
1:05:35
spend more time with them oh yeah and I just wanted to add um so I haven't gone
1:05:41
home since or to Upstate New York since 2021
1:05:49
January and it's not like there was going to be a problem like me leaving for a few days I could have done that
1:05:55
that but like my parents were able to come meet me at the Revival events and so it was just the holy spirit's wisdom
1:06:02
of like I just want you to stay focused right now um especially when I was
1:06:07
traveling all around the world every single week but even in the times where I wasn't traveling all around the week it just wasn't the leading of the Holy
1:06:12
Spirit like it just wasn't going to be fruitful for the kingdom and um and me
1:06:20
to go home before God's timing now of of going if that makes sense so to be
1:06:26
sensitive to to the Holy Spirit versus cultural norms like that's that's crazy
1:06:32
that like I'm traveling the whole world yet I haven't been to even like see my grandma
1:06:39
and my family that I love my grandma's in her late 80s you know I haven't seen them since for for four and a or since
1:06:47
2021 January it's like it doesn't it's not like culturally making sense you
1:06:52
know what I mean but it's the leading of the holy spirit so make sure you're not like feeling guilty or feeling pressured
1:06:58
by society and culture you have to do what the holy spirit is leading amen and
1:07:04
I make phone calls I call them at times you know is reporting an issue with the manager at work where I have to present
1:07:11
evidence and talk about what he did is it planting Bad Seeds like talking against someone um
1:07:20
so when it comes to like legal matters or like if there's
1:07:26
wrong things that have occurred in business or even like even like your
1:07:34
personal life if someone is harassing you if someone is you know hurting your
1:07:42
safety harming your safety something like that let's say right or bringing
1:07:47
abuse in some way um we have to use wisdom and we we have the people have
1:07:54
free will so we can't just say God stop this
1:08:02
person from doing this because people have free will people can people can
1:08:08
choose to be used by the enemy you know that's why we we we don't become acting
1:08:16
like we live in heaven while we're in Earth we lock our doors does that mean we don't trust God no but it's not wise
1:08:24
to say I'm going to keep my door unlocked cuz I don't need it Jesus is my protection and what I do is I pray for
1:08:30
to God that no person is allowed to come in my house and no we lock our doors
1:08:37
right same with like your children you're not going to just like leave your children somewhere um alone you know um
1:08:46
that's wisdom so the same thing applies same principle of like locking your
1:08:51
house doing this like physical thing um of putting a lock on the house on the
1:08:56
door the same thing applies to anything in life like if someone's threatening your safety harming you harassing you
1:09:03
doing illegal things to you um it's important to put up locks in the Physical Realm like
1:09:12
maybe you need to report it to the police or something or um maybe if it's something happening like at the job like
1:09:17
you're talking about and you've experience like harm happening to you the person should be stopped from
1:09:23
harming other people that might be you know important and so it's important for you to share just to be truthful these
1:09:30
things have happened to me like that that's that's very important it's wisdom it's like the action of putting the lock
1:09:36
on the door instead of leaving it unlocked and saying God will just fix the situation you know um and so you
1:09:44
don't need to feel bad about like it's not like you're talking bad about someone in certain situations like that
1:09:49
you're just sharing truth um that's important to share truth there's a time that it's very important to share
1:09:57
truth so the speaking bad about people that should what when you shouldn't speak bad about people is like so in
1:10:03
that situation you shouldn't go live and you shouldn't be like gossiping everywhere because you are mad about
1:10:10
what that person did and you want to vent about it and you want other people to think badly about them and speak
1:10:16
badly about them that's what you shouldn't do that's what you should not do or if someone like I experienced this
1:10:24
all the time like people people doing harm trying to do harm to me with like speaking words against me making up things against me
1:10:32
um I um I you know they have free will and Free Speech they have free will to
1:10:39
like make up lies and everything so um unless it was like harming me and they
1:10:45
because their false lies and false evidence is like making me to go to court how
1:10:50
like something like that then I will go and speak this is the truth this is what happened you know but if it's a
1:10:57
situation of just people speaking lies about me online or something I'm not going to just like say they have free
1:11:06
speech but they are wrong and like that's an area where God it's a
1:11:12
spiritual thing it's like they're they're not affecting my physical physical um they're not harming me
1:11:18
physically or literally harassing me they're just choosing to um use their
1:11:25
free will and do speak bad things you know that's an area where I need to let
1:11:30
God defend me and protect me and just stay focused and not be distracted by it and let the fruit speak for themselves
1:11:37
so if someone's speaking untrue things I'll let let them and I just do
1:11:43
my job of doing the work of God and letting the fruit speak and people make their own decisions that's what that's
1:11:50
when it's it's inappropriate to speak badly against someone
1:11:55
um there can other there can be other circumstances too like maybe if this person spoke this huge lie and like
1:12:02
so many people are like believing it that it's causing this huge like
1:12:10
disturbance I'm talking about maybe like for a minister then you can set the record
1:12:15
straight but like for me the majority of false accusations that are spoken
1:12:20
against me and lies that are speaking against me sure there's a large number that believe them
1:12:25
but I can see spiritually that for the most part it's because they're choosing to it's because many are like it's like
1:12:34
sheeps versus goats or like the wheat from the tears it's like people have
1:12:42
pride so they don't want to see the truth they don't allow God to show them the truth to see the fruits and that's a
1:12:48
free will matter so like normally that's what's taking place so that's why I
1:12:54
don't try to like defend myself and set the record straight because I know that
1:13:00
it's it's the people that are believing these things are the ones that want to and have free will to and their eyes
1:13:05
won't open no matter what I say you know that's normally why but then if there
1:13:11
was other I've had it happen in the past where God did want me to like set the record straight and speak about it like
1:13:17
um to to clarify things then it's time it's okay but you're still not speaking
1:13:23
bad against someone you can say you know this person spoke something that wasn't true but you speak it with um without
1:13:31
maliciousness like without um hate or trying to like speak against them but
1:13:36
just sharing truth I remember you saying sometimes God will have will have you hold testimonies until a later time how
1:13:44
do we know he's leading us the same with certain testimonies um
1:13:57
I'm try I'm just trying to think I know what you're talking about I remember sharing something so for me particularly
1:14:02
there's a couple things that have happened okay so I see like Okay so
1:14:07
let's look at the time of Jesus when he was beginning his ministry and just his ministry on the
1:14:13
earth there was so much resistance there the Pharisees were like
1:14:20
strong so strong that they um
1:14:25
they were responsible from for getting Jesus on the cross and crucifying him now God all allowed all of that God
1:14:33
allowed that God could have stopped that but he allowed that he wanted the he needed the sacrifice to happen
1:14:39
but then look at us now look at
1:14:44
us E I mean even more recently than now not not just thousands of years later
1:14:49
but even in the time of the Apostles 3,000 coming to Jesus in one day when
1:14:54
they there wasn't like hardly any believers before and all of a sudden 3,000 in one day like that's so
1:15:00
Supernatural it's just such a victory so like you you find Jesus facing this
1:15:07
incredible resistance and but it was temporary it was
1:15:12
temporary and so like Christianity Jesus is accepted
1:15:20
by it's like the biggest religion in the whole world or belief I don't we don't like to call it religion but because
1:15:26
belief what a victory like but look at the difference between that and like the
1:15:31
time of Jesus with the phes and saying that he was of the devil using demonic
1:15:36
powers and people believing it so much that they took him to the Cross there
1:15:42
was different seasons there was different seasons so um I know like for
1:15:48
this revival and for my Ministry and for my life that I living in constant Victory with
1:15:56
Jesus we are living in constant Victory with Jesus but it's 1% of the victory um that we're going to
1:16:03
see just like Jesus you know on the
1:16:11
cross people were saved that day when he when he was
1:16:16
crucified and resurrected but how many more have been saved since that day it
1:16:22
was like the the victory has just like grown you know so um yeah I have a lot
1:16:29
of testimonies of like how Fes have done things to me that I
1:16:34
don't share yet and some of it's with wisdom some of it's like literally to not give these ideas to other
1:16:40
Pharisees like they might be like oh that worked not that it worked but like
1:16:45
oh like that's that's a way to try to stop the work of God like there's certain testimonies that I have that I
1:16:51
don't share with wisdom like that because of the Season that we're currently in that I'm currently in but I
1:16:59
know there will come a time where I can like share details and it doesn't matter if people get these ideas these evil
1:17:07
ideas like oh like that's a great idea to try to stop the work of God um to try
1:17:13
to stop this ministry I'm going to try that now you know it doesn't matter like
1:17:18
they they can try all they want but they can't touch they really can't touch what God can do so you have to walk I have to
1:17:25
walk in that wisdom of um like the devil is so defeated but he's going to be even
1:17:31
more defeated and he knows that and it's like he's he's so antsy he's so antsy
1:17:38
and he he know it's like he tries it's like the devil threw all his punches so
1:17:43
hard when Jesus was on this Earth You know it's like it's kind of like it's
1:17:48
kind of like that like before it's like there comes that time
1:17:54
where Joseph was lifted out of the prison and he was placed in that
1:17:59
position of of being the highest position in all the land um second
1:18:05
highest position in all of the land and like so the devil knew that day was coming so he was like trying his hardest
1:18:13
in the prison like to just like throwing punches you know what I mean so you have to know the season of where like the
1:18:20
devil's kind of trying to throw more punches type thing and try not to
1:18:25
hurt your like give the devil so much opportunity that's what I mean so I
1:18:30
would say in in terms of like is the right time to share your testimony yet I would say like for the most part it's
1:18:38
having to do with what I just shared it's having to do with maybe uh with Ministries with with ministers because
1:18:43
of the the um the Pharisees but for most
1:18:49
people that like aren't ministers um I would say for the most part share everything for the most part
1:18:57
um but just be truthful because every testimony that you have like every miracle that God's done that's ripe
1:19:04
fruit that's ripe fruit now let's say you um let's say like let's say that you
1:19:14
battled with schizophrenia or some sort of mental problem and you've seen the thoughts diminish quite a bit um some
1:19:22
people might think I'm going to wait till they're gone complet completely to testify but that's not wise that's a
1:19:28
major miracle that God's done if the thoughts have diminished what you shouldn't do is like think that you're
1:19:34
making God proud or it's more faith to speak what's not true well maybe in the spiritual realm it's true you're
1:19:40
completely healed but you should you still should be truthful about the physical manifestations that you're
1:19:46
experiencing uh to make the the testimony even more powerful when the
1:19:51
physical manifestations are completely true like so let's say I mean
1:19:57
completely completely there so the proper way to do it is I used to battle
1:20:03
with all these demonic voices and then I went to where the anointing was uh and
1:20:09
now the thoughts diminished a lot and maybe share in detail like for example
1:20:15
it used to be like this in the morning in the middle day and the night and now it's just been at
1:20:21
the night time but I know that I'm Healed completely and I'm just like I'm Overjoyed by this incredible Miracle
1:20:27
don't downplay it you should really not downplay the testimony even though it's not complete yet physically manifested
1:20:33
you need to be truthful that it's very important your delivery of your testimony is very important you need to
1:20:39
share like the extent that it's blessed you and don't fake it at the same time you know don't fake it when you share
1:20:45
Little Miracles you don't have to OV exaggerate be truthful because people can see truth and it makes it even more
1:20:52
powerful when when you're truthful the whole way that when God brings the the full
1:20:58
manifestation you you can see in your face like you're telling the truth and you're so overcome and blessed than if
1:21:04
you're like acting and fake leading up to it you know what I mean so um so yeah
1:21:13
like that's what I mean like you for the most part you're to share you're just to share the
1:21:18
truth you're just to share the truth that you received a miracle share the
1:21:24
truth you received the partial Miracle share the truth and share it with hope in life
1:21:30
like speak declare like but I know that it's done in the spiritual realm and I can't wait to see it manifest physically
1:21:37
and I know it's going to come from testifying the more of the physical manifestation that's why it's so important to not hold back to not wait
1:21:43
oh I'm going to wait until um 100% I'm seeing it manifest physically because
1:21:49
it's Pro from in most cases it's your key to see the full manifestation is to testify the partial Miracle it it they
1:21:56
overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony the devil is so mad that you received this miracle
1:22:01
this partial Miracle halfway Miracle or something and so he wants to try to
1:22:07
steal that so he's going to come with attacks usually so you overcome him by
1:22:13
testifying amen and also like the the fruits the fruits are what brings uh
1:22:21
victory over the devil and makes God's Revival Unstoppable uh and to grow and grow and
1:22:28
grow and to be undeniable is what is what shows Jesus like the fruits are what reveals Jesus like this is Jesus
1:22:36
come and receive Jesus it's what reveals the truth is the fruits so we need to
1:22:43
see all the fruits you have a fruit don't hold it back you holding it back
1:22:49
is leading to less people seeing the truth seeing the light seeing
1:22:55
that this is Jesus and coming and receiving so it direct it directly
1:23:00
translates to those whose eyes are shut opening those who have been hounded by Pharisees lies and been confused to them
1:23:07
coming into Clarity and their eyes opening up your fruits no matter how big or small directly translated to that so
1:23:14
it's it's very crucial it's like the most important job you have especially in this season right now um is to to sh
1:23:22
to show the fruits to display the fruits of Jesus to display the fruits of his power his anointing his Revival the
1:23:30
ministry amen hallelujah I declare that you would grow
1:23:38
in wisdom from now that this word you received I see right now that there's
1:23:43
some words released today that's bringing salvation for many people like
1:23:49
salvation in terms of being in God's will I see some of
1:23:54
these questions that were answered today specifically like one I'm thinking of that I see some people tiptoeing around
1:24:01
God's will in the in the area of of some of the things I answered
1:24:09
and it's like an open door for the enemy to be tiptoeing around God's will in this area and I see that if you take
1:24:16
these as you take these words to Heart take them as the word of God take them as serious I see God just pulling you in to
1:24:24
his will like you've never been and safety safety Upon Your Life protection
1:24:30
