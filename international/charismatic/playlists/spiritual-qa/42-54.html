0:00
what is the difference between complaining and communicating a
0:08
dislike so this depends on your
0:14
audience I want to train you how to be spiritually mature in this
0:20
area um because the truth of the matter is is that God is so good he is
0:27
faithful and there's never anything to fear or worry about or need
0:35
to um be crazily distraught over but at the
0:41
same time we are human beings and we have emotions and um it's not like a bad
0:47
thing when we dislike something that's happening it's not a bad thing if we if
0:53
we if our feelings are that something's uncomfortable and difficult that's not
0:58
something bad that's real that's going to happen we are going to dislike things we are going to not enjoy the refining
1:05
fire for the most part a lot of it's going to be enduring um you know we should not feel
1:11
guilty if we're not like enjoying something that's hard uh God didn't ask us to have the
1:19
feelings of enjoyment of everything he's asking us to do he simply ask us asks us
1:24
to obey and he wants us to obey with a good heart meaning that we won't make a
1:33
big deal out of the fact that something is hard and we don't like it doesn't
1:39
mean we have to completely like suppress emotions
1:44
completely um but but but that we wouldn't put too much focus in our mind
1:51
in our words in our attitudes in our conversations that we wouldn't put too
1:56
much focus on the negative we wouldn't put too much Focus focus on the negative
2:01
um it doesn't mean that we have to completely ignore the reality of the situation though so um really the
2:10
difference between communicating a dislike and complaining is is is really about like a heart your heart um and
2:17
just to be aware yourself and to walk with the Holy Spirit you know like
2:24
um I would say like in my conversations in my in my conversations if I'm maybe
2:30
if I'm with um either maybe it's talking to with John tall maybe I'm talking to um my par
2:37
a parent of mine or something and I'm just maybe I'm sharing with them something that I'm going through that's difficult um something some sort of
2:45
trial or something I I could share about it um but I always like I always try to
2:53
make sure that I'm not putting a period if I'm ever talking about like Comm like
3:00
just talking about the reality of situation and if something's hard if something's difficult if something hurt
3:05
I try not to put a period there but like a comma like but God is good uh you know
3:12
I have to go through this refining fire um I know that uh God is faithful I know
3:19
that the promises will come to pass um I know that God is so good and I'll see
3:27
victory in my life um you know so when you're communicating with people that's
3:34
like how it should be and I mentioned in the beginning it depends on your audience so um for me to talk in that
3:42
kind of intimate way would not be with a lot of people when I you know this this
3:48
this way that I'm talking about right now if I'm communicating like this is what I'm going through now this is difficult if it's not in like a teaching
3:54
manner I wouldn't go sharing it with everyone but with spiritually mature people you know so it's like um not
4:03
going to number one be an open door for someone
4:09
to um take advantage of like a vulnerable moment or something and um speak the
4:18
opposite of Faith you know um and number two like your
4:25
spiritual maturity level um like when you if you're talking about something
4:31
you're going through with someone it should be this equally yolked moment where it's an iron sharpening iron
4:38
moment um you know when you are more
4:44
spiritually mature than someone else it's not going to be appropriate for you
4:49
to talk about the hard bad things that are going on your life in the moment you
4:55
know that might not help someone's Faith you have to that's why I say it depends
5:00
on your audience you have to use wisdom with um how you're communicating
5:06
about what you're going through in life amen so um so yeah but but to to to
5:15
Really summarize it um you kind of know when you're complaining you know what I
5:21
mean you you kind of know if you're if you if you really want to please God and you're really conscious about only
5:27
speaking life you'll know and so what if you start to speak you should catch yourself
5:33
and say okay yes this is happening but God you know but I know you know make
5:41
sure you see the right perspective and start speaking in the right godly perspective so with what I'm saying is
5:49
I'm I'm saying is you what I'm saying is you don't have to just not talk about trials you're going through in the midst
5:54
of the trials it's not like you have to wait to talk about the trials until you have the victory but
6:00
but speak out of faith and speak with life you can say the reality of what's
6:05
going on but put a Karma and Speak Life speak Faith um for for for other people
6:12
that listening like like you know for this to be a glorifying God moment for you guys to be Iron sharpening iron
6:18
together and also for your personal life for your personal faith so you can can
6:24
stay strong through this trial and and and also that you can that you can be
6:31
pleasing to God you know if I ever I'm in the midst of something I'm in the midst of something where I'm waiting on
6:38
God for something and um maybe waiting on uh Vindication or and it's taking
6:45
years or something a long time or if I happen to be talking about it I I I have the fear of God where I don't I know God
6:53
hears what I'm saying and I want him to be pleased with what I'm saying I want I
6:58
want I want him to see I trust you God and um
7:05
I'm content with everything in life right now because I'm in your will everything
7:12
that's happening in my life now is because this is what you want so I'm
7:17
content this is not easy I can't wait for the victory I can't wait for the
7:23
promise to be fulfilled but I'm not complaining I am content
7:30
and I trust you God what are other principles of God besides being planted
7:36
there's a lot of principles and these principles are in the word of God it's just like some
7:44
people take the word of God so lightly and um they don't see it as like this is
7:51
a principle like this is an important part of your walk as a Believer to be doing
7:58
this thing thing to be applying this thing this principle and like regularly
8:05
and when you do these things when you're applying these principles um you then will see the
8:13
Abundant Life that Jesus has given us as an inheritance
8:18
released accessed accessible and you will then be able to access the
8:26
anointing because the anointing that God releases or to walk in the power of God
8:33
it doesn't simply come from fasting praying and having a pure heart and living a pure life
8:41
alone but applying God's principles and like here's a great
8:48
example so I'll I'll I'll share a couple more principles than just being planted but being planted let's just take that
8:53
one first an example of like how a lot of people don't realize the importance
8:59
of God's principles and they're not applying them so there's some people that are just just want to
9:05
be um a Christian their own way and think that they like they just need to
9:10
live pure not sin um read the Bible pray fast be loving to
9:17
others and they can and besides that they can do whatever they want so like
9:24
if they don't feel like going to church they don't have to they are the church they will say no
9:30
we are we we make up part of the church but the church
9:36
includes the equipping that comes from the fful ministry Apostles prophets
9:43
evangelists pastors and teachers according to Ephesians 41 the Bible says do not neglect the Gathering of the
9:50
Believers so you know you see Ephesians 4 with that God gave these these offices
9:56
for the equipping we see the scripture of God needs there to be
10:01
equipping we see the scripture do not neglect Gathering we see in the acts
10:08
church this example of what church look should look like how they were always Gathering Together how they were an awe
10:15
at the signs and wonders performed by the Mir signs wonders and miracles performed by the apostles uh we see that
10:22
they were devoted to the apostles teachings in the book of Acts but but all of the like all of like
10:28
those script rur that I'm sharing is the principle of attending
10:35
church and being and not just going anywhere as another scripture in the
10:40
Psalms talks about you shall be like a tree that is planted by streams of
10:45
Living Water and your we your leaves will never wither and every season they will prosper the prophetic Revelation
10:52
there is talking about being planted not going to several several churches but being planted in one Church where
10:59
God has called you to so that scripture there all these scriptures in the acts
11:04
Ephesians these combine to be a principle in the word of God of being
11:12
planted which means uh devoting yourself to one church that Ministry that God has
11:17
called you to to grow in to be rooted in
11:23
and that also means that you will devote yourself to the teachings of the Apostles for example as it says the book
11:29
of Acts it also means that Miracles will be taking place there if you need healing and deliverance they will that will be taking place there um you know
11:38
and it says do not neglect the Gathering so you you should make this a priority you know not just once in a while but
11:44
every week every time they service you are there so so that's the scripture all
11:50
the scriptures there show us here this principle of being
11:56
planted at a church that's where you're equipped that's where you're fed that's where you grow um it's also where you
12:01
are serving in the work of God it's where you're um sewing so that there can be reaping in your life so there's some
12:08
people that they they they they they don't understand or they don't value
12:15
these principles a principle of being planted and they they either don't go to
12:20
church at all um because they don't feel like it and they just want to be a Christian their own way or they Church
12:28
hop or they're not don't take it really seriously the principle being planted and then they are they they wonder why
12:35
they're not walking in the anointing they wonder why they are not seeing Abundant Life come in every area they
12:42
wonder why they're praying and they're praying and they're praying and it's as simple as
12:47
this follow apply God's principles one of them is being planted
12:54
I'll list a few others now so being planted is a principal and all the these principles are in the word um I do have
13:02
a um a teaching from
13:08
like gosh it was like a year and a half ago now but it's under the on YouTube playlist under Revival army training
13:14
it's under that playlist of about 30 something sermons of like really um
13:20
vital messages if you are planted at 5f if you're serious about being trained to be
13:26
a Revival Warrior in God's Army but there's a a message
13:33
called um I think it's called spiritual laws and so principles laws they it's
13:40
pretty much the same thing uh same similar meaning so I I'm not going to
13:46
teach on it completely right now but I you can watch that message about different kinds of spiritual laws I
13:53
teach them in depth but I'm going to list some of them now so um another so principle of being being planted a
13:59
principle of sewing and reaping uh and that can be with that
14:06
that is so much with the with the the the financial seed but also sewing with
14:13
actions and sewing with your words that's a
14:19
principle um uh let's see a principle of authority that I was teaching this past
14:25
Sunday at fful church so if you didn't see that message I taught about principle of authority so that's really
14:31
just meaning like understanding what Authority means and since we're called to walk in authority we can't just walk
14:38
in authority any old way we can't cast out demons any old way it has to be in the principle of authority that we cast
14:47
out demons we can't come up with like creative ways that we think it's best to
14:52
cast out demons it has to align with the principle of walking in
14:57
authority uh there's a principle of um a principle
15:04
of of like territory and domain that's like a branch off of authority like when
15:10
like a deeper meaning one of the meanings of of this principle of authority which I also Ted about on
15:17
Sunday um meaning like when you understand Authority you
15:23
have to also understand domain territory the president of the United States is president of the United States and not
15:30
um every country that's how it works in the spiritual realm you can you can only cast out
15:37
demons in your domain um and so this is just like a really basic example
15:43
that everyone probably understands but they don't understand that it's actually like a principle of domain Authority and
15:50
domain is like if I it's like if I if I
15:56
were to like like run into a random
16:01
Church in La a different random Church in LA on a Sunday and and go in the
16:07
church and says thus says the Lord there are so many people who are oppressed here and God has sent me here to to
16:14
deliver them so right now I'm taking over the service and I'm going to be
16:19
casting out demons now it's true there's a lot of people there that are oppressed for sure in lots of churches um but I
16:26
can't do that God doesn't want me to do it like that that because it's it's outside of his outside of the principle
16:34
of domain and territory now if a minister at that church um you know
16:41
reached out to me and and you know was humble and was just like holy spirit's leading me to invite you to minister at
16:47
my church because I see that you carry anointing for deliverance and a lot of my people in my church have been just
16:55
coming just sharing me they have addiction they have anxiety depression I see the testimonies on your um social
17:01
media so can you come and take over the service one day you know just Minister and now that
17:09
would be my domain my territory so that's just a little um easy example to
17:15
understand about how uh like the principle of territory or domain same
17:22
thing um yeah so those are just a few and as I shared
17:30
in my in that message that I shared about I share other principles there's many other principles they're in the
17:36
word of God just needs the Revelation from the Holy Spirit God's a god of order a god of principles laws it
17:44
doesn't mean like like a lot of people think the Old Testament like we throw away the laws but he's still a god of
17:50
order of principle now we have his grace but he's still a god of principle we
17:57
don't just do do whatever we want be a believer however we want pray for people
18:02
however we want Minister however we want and it's not like holy spirit how should I Minister it's he has order he has
18:09
principles so it's not just like we all just ask Holy Spirit how should I Minister but he actually has
18:16
principles that we need to follow it's not about like go everyone
18:22
going asking him and he gives different answers it it's all the same principle first and then within that Holy Spirit
18:30
will lead you according to um the situation who
18:35
you're praying for and everything but we have to first be going by the
18:42
principles there are other principles too like um there's so many principles I
18:51
mean like so many of my teachings are teaching different principles it's just not that I'm titling it the principle of
18:58
this but we could call it that like the principle
19:03
of of self discipline like
19:10
um if you are serving at church or you have a job at if you're if you at a job
19:16
or something and there are rules there are protocols um like Beyond time and
19:23
just certain you know protocols like you need
19:28
to follow them and so when it comes to serving God and you're you're you're not
19:35
simply F respecting Authority and following that um
19:41
rule you're you're like breaking laws in the spiritual realm like people don't
19:47
really understand the seriousness of it
19:52
um I also shared a message a few weeks ago which is teaching so much more on
19:58
this too called um order in the church and um like this is another
20:05
principle um like you
20:11
you you you can't really tell your leader God told me
20:19
this concerning you like God doesn't operate in that
20:27
order it like how how it says in the Bible how the the it is like the oil
20:33
that is Flowing from Aaron's beard down from his head down his beard down to his
20:39
the edges of his robes it speaks this in Psalms and this is a prophetic picture of the flow of the anointing in the body
20:47
um how God pours out the anointing to the leader of the church and then everyone who is planted underneath who
20:54
is serving submitted underneath then the anointing then flows down to the rest of the body and so when it comes to like
21:01
the word of God going forth maybe it could be for different directions or
21:06
something um you know like like
21:12
um for someone to say like God told me that you need to start a
21:19
university um or God told me that you know you need to right
21:26
now by a massive church or something and that's where the church is going to be now or something like that you know like
21:32
if if someone in the church underneath a leader come and tell his leader that
21:38
that's like that's not out of order like God wouldn't speak that way because he's
21:43
strict to his laws and principles in that regard so if God like wanted um
21:50
fivefold Church wanted me as a leader to start a college he would speak it to me
21:56
um like directly or through my spiritual father like in that order it wouldn't come from those under um those under in
22:06
the church so um yeah so that's like a
22:12
principle so when you understand that principle then you'll have it it
22:18
Understanding God's principles actually helps you to hear God's voice discern God's voice because there can be so much
22:23
confusion like did God just show me this or was this my a or was just the angel
22:29
of Light and a lot of it is just Understanding God's character his
22:34
kingdom how he works his order his principles then you'll start to be able
22:39
to discern like okay that wasn't God because he doesn't work like that he doesn't speak like that he doesn't speak
22:46
out of order like that can you clarify more about what words of death are
22:52
so words of death in general are words that contra contct the
22:58
word of God the character of God God's will for your
23:06
life
23:11
so example um the obvious ones
23:17
are speaking about your future saying I'm I I it can be even I think like I
23:25
think I'm going to fail I think this is going to be disaster um this isn't going to work I
23:32
don't speaking like that uh that would be words of death
23:38
um because God With God anything is possible and so I'm talking about like
23:43
things that God's calling you to do um God also tells us that we shouldn't worry about anything there's nothing to
23:50
worry there's nothing to fear um so we shouldn't be speaking words of fear we
23:55
shouldn't be speaking words of doubt we shouldn't be speaking um in agreement to
24:02
the devil's lies so um by his stripes we are
24:08
healed Jesus has paid the price for us to be healed for us to receive complete healing
24:13
now and so um the doctor will say doctor could say you know you have this sickness you
24:21
have this you have this this is the diagnosis this is
24:26
um you know you yep that's physical reality but we believe that the spiritual reality is greater is more
24:36
real than the physical reality uh because God can do anything
24:41
he's a god of Miracles and so um we know that he wants to turn this around he
24:47
wants to change this he wants to remove the sickness remove the oppression we know he can do this he has the power to
24:53
do this and he wants to do it so and he so that's more real to us than
24:59
the physical reality so we speak these things the things that God wants to do
25:05
his will um instead of the physical reality so the proper thing to do is to say you
25:12
know the doctor says these things that I have these things that's okay you can say the doctor says this the reports
25:19
show this that I have
25:25
link but but by Jesus's Stripes I am
25:31
healed and I receive my healing and I declare I am healed in Jesus name and I
25:38
declare that any sickness pain must go from me I don't receive those words
25:44
spoken over me I don't receive those diagnosis and even the pain I feel in my
25:50
body I declare it must go and I declare I am healed I declare I have no pain in
25:55
jesus' name that it is gone I am healed so that's speaking words of
26:00
life and you're rejecting the words of death so you don't need to be paranoid
26:06
like I can't I can't the doctor said this I can't I just I'm just I'm just
26:12
not going to tell anyone what the doctor said like no you don't have to feel like that but ju have the comma have the butt
26:18
doctor says this but this is what I believe this is my truth I declare this
26:24
and I believe this is it possible for a narcissist to be delivered even if they
26:30
don't think they have a problem with God nothing is
26:38
impossible nothing the powerful things that will
26:43
help that to take place for a narcissist would be
26:49
for those close to the person in their life their seriousness of serving God
26:56
like when you are serious about serving God and you are applying his you're
27:02
following his principles and you're really walking in the anointing and you sew seeds for certain needs like sewing
27:10
seeds for prayer requests making sacrifice to God like pulling on the anointing sewing more into that
27:16
anointing more um and you you know you you you take action in the spiritual
27:23
realm with these principles of God that has such an effect
27:29
on it's such an effect in the spiritual realm on the devil's grip on somebody it like it loosens the devil's grip on
27:36
someone when there's someone Waring for them in the kingdom of
27:43
God but um yeah I mean God can deliver anybody God can deliver anybody of
27:50
anything and God knows when it's a mind delusional problem you know he knows and
27:57
he has such grace and mercy on all of his children um so it is
28:04
absolutely possible anything is possible anything is possible and the important
28:10
thing is for like a narcissist for them to seek God for them at least to seek
28:17
God maybe they don't realize they need Deliverance maybe they don't realize the issues they have the like
28:23
self-centeredness and everything but if they can just start seeking God
28:29
then then more will come more more Miracles More anointing will
28:36
come into their life if they can just start seeking God so if you have a
28:42
friend who is that way or you know someone just love them so that they can
28:47
love them like be a vessel of God so that they can sense God's love through
28:53
you which plants seeds of of bringing hunger in
28:59
them to want more of God so instead of like confronting them so
29:07
much and saying like you have an issue you need Deliverance you're a narcissist you don't realize it instead of doing
29:12
those things pursue them with Supernatural love of
29:18
God with unconditional love of God and and encourage them to come come to Jesus
29:27
come to where his power is where his anointing is each and every
29:33
time we start to pray is it necessary to start with repentance prayer hopefully you won't have to repent every
29:40
time no it's um that's re religious uh I
29:48
mean when you truly repent to God like like truly repent in with with surrender
29:54
like surrender like go from whether it's uh whether it's being an unbeliever to
30:02
believing and surrendering everything or you've been a lukewarm believer for a while and you're repenting from being
30:09
lukewarm and now you're changing direction and turning now to Jesus fully
30:14
to full surrender so when you repent that that's the big
30:20
repentance that that's the that's the the big Turning Point the big repentance of surrender to Jesus
30:30
um there shouldn't need to be tons of repentances after
30:37
that if your heart is genuine if your heart is really genuine and you really
30:43
have the fear of God you genuinely want to obey God and be in his will and serve
30:49
him and Obey him the holy spirit is more than enough to help you walk in
30:55
obedience stop stop sinning now one needs Deliverance though I'm talking
31:01
about where the power of God is because many people have surrendered but they need Deliverance they have a demon of
31:08
addiction that's making them to sin all the time but they themselves they don't want to sin but it's making them to sin
31:15
constantly so when one really has surrendered and one is where anointing
31:22
is so they can be delivered so so now they are delivered now there's no demons
31:28
controlling them to S forcing them to sin and they've fully
31:33
surrendered from then honestly there shouldn't need to be tons of repentances
31:41
at first perhaps because you are maybe it depends on the person's uh it depends
31:48
on a person's um walk with the Lord it depends like like for me I was a
31:56
believer almost all my life and I was lukewarm for a while but
32:02
once I encountered God's power I surrendered everything
32:08
and I had already I was already like a pure like I already had Purity in me
32:14
even when I was living lukewarm like I already had Purity there I had a lot of
32:19
Purity qualities like I didn't gossip I didn't complain really much
32:27
I didn't really speak words of death um I didn't ever swear I didn't
32:34
lie um I what
32:40
else um but and I would go I would go to
32:45
church always all the time and I Tred to treat people with such kindness and love
32:53
everyone so like that was my life when I was lukewarm but the lukewarm qualities of my life was um
33:02
um before I surrendered before I encountered God's power the lukewarm areas was I would um drink not get like
33:09
really drunk but I would drink um I would want attention from people like like guys and I would um never want to
33:18
be alone I would always want to just fill my life with social like social life like friends having them around and
33:25
I wasn't serious about taking aone time with God um so those were the areas of
33:32
lukewarm so then once I encountered God's power um and for me it was really
33:37
a quick transformation where all of a sudden like I just wanted to spend time with
33:42
God all the time and I I didn't I didn't have it wasn't this like crazy trans
33:47
long transformation in me of getting to me this place where I could now spend
33:53
time with God and say no to social things and hanging out with people it was fast once I surrendered um it wasn't
34:01
like this long progression transformation
34:06
um uh I I had no taste for things of the world I had no taste for attention from
34:12
anyone or drinking or anything like that gone completely when I encountered God's power when I
34:17
surrendered um and what did I go over all the lukewarm
34:25
areas I think so yeah so so anyways like once I
34:32
surrendered I was able to really immediately live in obedience to God and
34:40
I remember making like a couple a couple mistakes and repenting but it it was so
34:47
rare because the holy spirit is so powerful the holy spirit is
34:53
enough um and I think sometimes people don't realize that thoughts come from the devil and they think they're sinning
34:59
by thoughts that come in their mind um and so they think that they're like sinning tons of times every day when
35:05
they're not it's the devil sending these thoughts as long as you don't want to have the thoughts and you reject the
35:12
thoughts they're not your thoughts so um and and and and by the
35:19
grace of God I had the fear of God like the moment that I encountered God's power and I surrendered this the fear of
35:26
God really came over for me and it's been in me since that day where it's like the most serious thing to me in the
35:33
world like it's what would upset me more than anything is if I displeased God if
35:41
I let God down um and it's not like a performance thing I don't mean it in a
35:47
performance way but it's like I just know how important obedience
35:54
is to him and I know know how um like for me to F for for me to be
36:05
a vessel of him for God to do what he wants to
36:11
do certain things that he does through me it depends on my obedience so if I
36:17
disobey in something I'm block I'm stopping God from being able to do that thing that he
36:24
wanted to do and that thing that he wanted to do is anything that God wants to do is the
36:30
most important thing in the entire
36:35
world entire world well I mean just think of it this way like glory to God through fold church
36:44
and the revivals now events and the lives like so many people have been delivered and um I means so many people
36:51
have been saved from Spirits of suicide right but like what if I didn't take
36:56
obedience to God seriously you know
37:02
um God would use other people but like God doesn't it's not just easy to
37:08
raise someone up like people could have been lost people
37:14
could have been lost you know people or people's Deliverance could have been um
37:20
delayed uh you know like that's why I was trying trying to share with you like get have you to have the perspective
37:27
that's just just my just one example but anything we do anything we're doing for
37:33
God it's so important like it's I didn't know editing this video on the plane
37:41
ride to my 30th birthday celebration like editing this one minute
37:48
video on the plane I didn't know like that obedience was that important it it
37:55
seems like something mundan St silly we had like hardly any following at that point back in 2020 but then I put that
38:02
video out and I woke up the next morning it went viral and tons of Miracles had happened all these people thousands
38:07
people testifying of Miracles that they' received while watching feeling
38:13
something lift off of them and now they feel peace feeling pain Le their bodies and
38:18
so not not just not just me like you like you you in your life and you're
38:24
doing like mundane things you know seems M but it's so important we can't see how
38:29
important it is right now but it it's connected to what God wants to do on
38:35
this Earth and what God wants to do in this earth is more important than fi than scientists finding the cure for
38:42
cancer it's it's more important than every president's job on this Earth it's
38:49
it whatever you know important work job you can imagine it what God wants to do is so
38:57
important so glory to God when I encountered God's power and surrendered
39:02
the fear of God came over me where I and and and and by the way I
39:09
just prophetically I sense this this word I've been talking about a lot this
39:15
week and I posted the video about the fear of God recently prophetically because so many
39:21
people are missing the fear of God and it's it's like it's really serious like
39:27
it's it's really serious it's really really really really serious um we we
39:32
got to take God more seriously like we we got to take obeying God more seriously uh we got to make it more
39:39
important than anything we can't be so hyper graced and Casual um about God you know but um we
39:48
need to have the fear of God so when you have the fear of God when you have the fear of
39:53
God when you really have the fear of God it like when that's when that's really
39:59
in your life that means that it is the most important thing to please God to be
40:04
in his will to obey him and so automatically everything follows like
40:09
automatically you'll be able to hear his voice you won't miss his Voice
40:14
automatically you will feel conviction if um there's a Temptation or
40:21
something um you know Auto a atically the holy spirit
40:28
will be helping you to not sin to not mess up to not miss it to not miss the mark it comes automatically if you can
40:36
just have the fear of God yeah so um really a believer's life
40:45
when they are following God's principles they have
40:50
the anointing in their life they're receiving the the anointing pour upon them where they are
40:58
planted um and they're not missing things they're not missing the spiritual
41:03
nutrients that God releases through the five-fold ministry the equipping the teaching the anointing the
41:09
impartation um you will be able to live a Pure Life and I I don't have the scripture now but
41:16
I know that there are there is scripture there is one scripture in particular that talks about I'm going to just kind
41:23
of summarize it um but there's a scripture that says that something like God has made it
41:31
not too difficult to not sin um to be able to live by the spirit
41:40
to be able to live free of sin he has made it not too difficult there's a
41:48
scripture that I'm summarizing that it literally says that so um yeah I mean there's so many
41:54
different wrong doctrines out there there's some people that are just like we're all Sinners we're all Sinners no
41:59
we are no longer slaves to sin the Bible says we used to be Sinners where we couldn't control our
42:08
sin we just we inherently were sinful and bad but we have been we our our old
42:14
sinful self has been crucified with Jesus and we have been made a new
42:20
creation now we are the righteousness of God now we are one with the Holy Spirit
42:26
because we are one with the Holy Spirit he is able to be our Helper and help us
42:31
to live how he wants always if we will just surrender if we will just cooperate
42:38
with the Holy Spirit he will every second of every day day guide us to live
42:44
holy pure sinless lives not saying oh
42:49
you'll never sin again you will never make mistake of course but they should be very few is how it really should
42:59
be yes so um to to be saying a prayer of
43:05
repentance every time you're praying that's praying religiously that's not good it's not good to pray religiously
43:11
because you're not praying authentically and led by the spirit and you are you
43:16
are praying like you're in the old Covenant which is
43:22
bondage religion is a horrible snare so praying religiously is a big deal don't
43:29
do it Pray by the spirit pray um pray uh
43:36
communicate with God for who he is the Holy Spirit who lives inside of
43:41
you a real person not far away not not some mechanical robot not some only
43:49
understanding nkjv language speak to God for who he is he's
43:56
a real person who created you so he wants you to speak from your heart your
44:03
own language uh speak to him as a real living person who has a brain because he
44:13
does and then you'll be able to really be friends with the Holy
44:18
Spirit and that's how you're able to build your love for him where you just
44:24
constantly want to please him and be in his will that comes from being in love with him and you can't be in love with a
44:31
mechanical robot that only speaks n k or that only speaks
44:37
KJV translation or Bible for example you have to be friends who with someone that
44:43
you that that you can be yourself with so that's very important I've had
44:51
people ask me for advice regarding emotional outbursts and they're afraid they've sinned for being angry what kind
44:59
of advice should I give them regarding emotional control so they shouldn't so
45:04
when we sin we shouldn't be afraid because God wipes away our sins when we
45:11
repent so they have we have to make sure first of all that with this issue that they
45:18
have the issue of anger emotional outbursts shouldn't have fear because
45:26
then they're being more like Adam and Eve like oh I sinned I got to hide and cover myself and they're going to be in
45:33
this repetitive um action going in circles it's it's they're not going to change so
45:39
they first need to make sure they're not afraid they need to realize that they need to they need to
45:45
realize God loves them it's okay that he sees them naked meaning the issues that
45:53
they're having it's good for God to see them naked that's how he can help them
45:58
so rather than being afraid that they've sinned they need to be naked come to
46:03
Jesus and say this seems to be an issue sometimes I don't have control over my anger and I don't want to be that way I
46:10
know that's not being Godly and pleasing to you so Lord help me they need to be
46:16
open come to God decide they want to change in that area because um the fruit of the holy
46:24
spirit is gentleness kindness uh
46:31
peace and um when you really are refined and have
46:36
the character of Christ so much in you you will not naturally even feel
46:44
anger towards another person in your refining maybe you feel
46:53
it but you don't act on it and praise God that is counted
46:59
as as you know not being angry as long as you're rejecting feelings that you're having but as you're transformed even
47:07
more you won't even have those those feelings you'll instead be so spiritual
47:13
that you will see things in the spiritual realm if someone does something bad to you you you realize you're in a spiritual war you realize
47:20
that this person has done something because they've not surrendered to God they've they or maybe they um they've
47:28
had a really bad past it's led to a lot of Oppression perhaps maybe they've had a lot of people do bad things to them
47:34
and now hurt people hurt people um but end of this end long story short um you
47:40
know that it's spiritual and that they need God's love and they are
47:45
missing God's love in their life and even if they have received God's love
47:50
and they just chose to be evil they chose to turn away from God they chose to be like Lucifer you know there's
47:58
people like that out there too even then we are called to love our enemies and um
48:04
even then we because we love God so much we renew our mind I'm called to love my
48:10
enemies so when you're refined you will find as
48:16
time goes on you don't even feel hatred anger towards a person
48:23
inside so I share that for for for for you for people to know what's possible
48:30
and what God wants and when you can know there is a problem there is an issue I mean there is uh either a bondage and or
48:39
there is um flesh that is too strong that there needs to be a denying of the
48:46
flesh so um if a person is really having emotional outburst and they don't want to like they are and especially if it's
48:54
happening towards people that love and they are lashing out they are and they feel like they're not even themselves
49:00
they feel like they don't have control and they have so much regret after that is usually demonic
49:08
oppression of like anger rage um and sometimes that it can happen
49:15
because it can come in through abuse mistreatment maybe someone was so would
49:21
would lash out at them all the time as a kid maybe and it came in through their and now they're doing that to
49:27
others because that Spirit was transferred um so you should share with that person that God can free them and
49:36
that's not their real heart if they don't want to be doing that that's not their true heart but the the enemy is having control so um they should seek
49:43
Jesus where his power is and position themselves where the anointing is and be set free but um also it's important
49:52
to walk with God for your character to be refined find by denying your flesh by
49:59
um building up your spirit Man by seeking Jesus by positioning yourselves
50:05
where the anointing is planting yourself where the power of God is so so the the the word like right now the anointed
50:12
word is coming to you and it's making your spirit come alive it's making your spirit to grow so like after this live
50:19
right now literally if something uh I don't know if someone was like did something that would normally
50:27
make you angry or something you would be built up so you would respond more Godly
50:33
than you would have before this live probably for some of you this could probably be the case this is not the
50:39
only way to build up your spirit man you should also be reading the word you should also be praying in the spirit you should also be communing with God
50:45
regularly Renewing Your Mind regularly meditating on the word of God there's a lot of different ways to build up your
50:50
spirit man but when you build up your spirit man that's also the action of denying your flesh you're putting focus
50:56
on the spirit the spiritual things and you're turning your eyes from the things of the flesh the things of the world the
51:03
negative things the way the world responds to things and so that's how God refines you when you cooperate with God
51:11
in that process by of refining your character by seeking him and building up
51:17
your spirit man so um a person who's delivered from
51:22
Rage or who needs deliverance from Rage usually needs to do both things but there can be some cases
51:29
where they've they've they've they've worked they've um been refined so much
51:36
you know they really are they've been surrendered they've been seeking God for so long but they find this rage just
51:42
takes over so because they've been seeking God and God already has done this work all that's needed is the
51:47
Deliverance once they're free they might their character might already have been
51:53
refined in that area like they might find just like they don't even feel angry anymore praying in the spirit how to
52:01
pray in the spirit it means a couple things so it means number one not
52:06
praying religiously but praying Holy Spirit L um and so to make sure that
52:13
you're not um just going through the motions and out of tradition and religious
52:19
tradition but you are praying in spirit and in truth that you are
52:26
um praying from your heart and you are not doing out of performance or to check
52:32
off the list that you have now prayed for the day but that you are doing it
52:39
out of obedience and because you love God and you want to communicate with him
52:44
spend time with him so as you do those things you are already praying by the
52:52
spirit and then also just according to what you're praying maybe you're declaring things
52:57
like rejecting the devil declaring life when you go according to God's word
53:04
and his principles that you should be rejecting the attacks the lies and declaring life or declaring what is not
53:13
there when there is lack you're speaking abundance that's praying by the spirit
53:18
it's praying by the word and by the spirit you're going by the word and speaking it so you're
53:24
praying by the spirit it also means praying in tongues so it's has different
53:30
meanings but praying in tongues is also praying by the spirit When you pray in
53:35
tongues you're praying the Heavenly language you're praying directly to the Holy Spirit you're praying not in your
53:41
own understanding by the spirit my adult children tolerate abuse from
53:47
relationships what's the best thing to do to stop this in the spiritual
53:53
realm so so they have free will so what needs to happen is for them
54:03
to choose I mean for them to choose right
54:08
for them to for their their eyes need to open up in the spiritual realm and
54:14
understand what's going on in the spiritual realm and understand that the
54:19
the the the the relationship the abuse of relationships that's not an equally o relationship that's not what God wants
54:25
for them God has so much better for them and um they need to also realize that it's
54:33
opening up a door for the enemy to allow that relationship to remain to
54:40
to have that abuse happening to them it's an open door for the enemy um but
54:47
this is a time where I mean this is a situation where um we we really have to
54:53
be gentle because um they have free will they have free will so um how all these
55:00
things will take place how their eyes will open up is by the love of God
55:07
opening their eyes so um you as a parent the best
55:13
thing you can do is just love them with the love of God the kindness of God leads to
55:21
repentance so if they're not in a place where they're wanting to seek God they're wanting to seek the the
55:27
spiritual meat these spiritual truths that a lot of people don't know that lukewarm Christians don't know if
55:32
they're not in that place you can't force it but the kindness of God leads
55:38
to repentance when they encounter the kindness of God which comes so much at
55:44
the time through vessels through you God they are they are receiving
55:51
God's love in their life and God's love is is um pretty
55:58
irresistible so I mean when most people really love someone with the love of
56:03
God most people want that love to remain and want more of it so um this is our
56:11
job to be the light of the world we want to love people with Supernatural love of God unconditional love um a love that
56:17
they don't deserve a love that's maybe hard for us sometimes because maybe they
56:22
um don't really receive it or you know
56:28
don't don't reciprocate it you know but um when we love them really with this
56:35
love of God and deny our flesh to
56:41
um do anything but love them it will be planting seeds in the
56:48
spiritual realm it will lead them to desire more of that love which will lead
56:53
them to opening up more and um like like
56:59
taking your word more seriously and that's what we want like we want to be
57:07
this light where people want to talk with us and then these talking with us
57:14
leads to conversations about God and it leads to curiosity how come your life
57:20
has progressed how it has how come doors have opened for you how come you have so much peace and joy like I see difference
57:27
in your life recently like what what happened and you tell
57:33
them Jesus and you tell them or maybe you've been a Christian your whole life but you you recently encountered his
57:38
anointing and that's what made the difference that's what brought the Deliverance the change the eyes opened to the spiritual realities the spiritual
57:47
principles um and you share with them the power of God I was delivered
57:53
and you are planting seeds through that and that's encouraging that that's that's putting hunger in them Desiring
58:02
what you have so that's what needs to take place like them to receive the word
58:07
of God the truth but we can't just force it we can't just be like these relationships are an open door to the
58:13
devil like we can't just um go against their Free Will and not be gentle
58:18
because that won't make them want to receive it we want them to receive it so
58:23
we got to go uh the the Holy Spirit way led by the spirit how do we handle people who have
58:30
old wine skin around us like parents or
58:35
relatives you just have to walk in wisdom in terms of like your conversations like you have to
58:40
understand that if people are wanting to remain in their old wine skins um they have free
58:47
will and um they aren't called to be your iron
58:54
sharpen iron in this season at least and you can't throw your pearls to
59:02
swines the Bible says so um people with old wines skin are
59:08
religious so they many times are be like the Pharisees and reject the new wine
59:14
and call it the devil so um when you're aware that someone has old wine
59:22
skin you should not throw pearls to the swines the best thing to do is to is the
59:30
answer I just gave before this is to just love them because there just needs to be repentance there needs to be repentance of humility humility is what
59:39
opens up their eyes to see that they have old win skin and to see the truth
59:44
to see the new wine to see new thing that God is doing humility so when
59:51
people have old wine skin repentance is what's needed repentance of humility and so the kindness of God
59:58
leads to repentance love them and just understand
1:00:04
it's not time to share all your Revelations with them because it's not the time for them
1:00:13
and it will be like throwing pearls to swines and depending on what they're like it could um open up an unnecessary
1:00:21
door of the devil speaking lies to you and bringing attack and like if the
1:00:31
person is um now you know you're sharing with them your pearls and now they're like you're
1:00:39
crazy you're delusional you're deceived you know like speaking like how the Pharisees would to Jesus and the
1:00:46
followers of Jesus if they start doing that and then they can start to think that then they can start to like
1:00:52
actively work to try to um change you
1:00:58
and so now you have the enemy just like literally now scheming to try to pull
1:01:04
you out from God's Will and it's just so unnecessary like you don't need to open up that door don't throw your pearls to
1:01:12
swine so just walk in that wisdom I know you have this heart like I want your eyes to open up but we have to move with
1:01:19
wisdom we have to move gently the best thing we can do is love them and when you sense they're opening up when you
1:01:25
sense there's humility there's openness they want to learn from you they want to listen to your testimony then throw
1:01:32
those pearls give those pearls share share share but don't prematurely share
1:01:38
what's not um wise to share it's like me when I received my prophecy the prophecy
1:01:45
that I was called to be an apostle I was called to reach the Nations and um I knew so few people would understand
1:01:53
that I knew it I mean and at that time of my life I came
1:02:00
from have KN I now it's gone viral back then Deliverance had not gone
1:02:07
viral I didn't know a single person oh no I didn't know more than like one
1:02:12
person was casting demons out in the US in as of
1:02:23
2016 and 200 early 2016 or no
1:02:29
2015 I didn't know even demons existed and anybody was casting out demons
1:02:36
today uh 2015 I didn't know Apostles existed prophets existed I had no clue and I was a
1:02:44
Christian my whole life I was so open I mean I was so I mean I was not um I was the opposite of a Pharisee like it's
1:02:50
like so I knew that if me I was open you know and me I was open I had traveled
1:02:57
the whole world around a cruise ship went to 13 Nations for a study abroad program I now lived in LA from upstate
1:03:03
New York I've been in so many different Christian circles I had like more than a hundred Christian friends from different
1:03:10
Avenues of life and I only heard about two people that were baptized in the Holy Spirit
1:03:16
Come 205 so prior 2015 I had all these
1:03:21
Christian friends and not one of them I had I ever heard anybody talk about miracles Deliverance
1:03:29
healing Apostles prophets baptism holy spirit so then my eyes opened and my
1:03:35
eyes opened fast like fast like I was like this is the truth and everyone's
1:03:42
missing it oh my goodness even like leaders what's going on like everyone I've listened to um yeah so and then
1:03:51
then I received this Prophecy from a prophet and all the hund something Christian
1:03:57
friends and family in my life I never heard them say one word about a prophet I knew that most of them didn't know prophets existed today so you know I
1:04:06
really by the grace of God walked in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to not throw my pearls to swines and so I told very
1:04:13
few people I mean I ended up I I then would share publicly a testimony on my Facebook but I didn't go like call up
1:04:20
friends and say what do you think about this and I already knew I already knew
1:04:26
they wouldn't get it and it wouldn't be wise and there is no sense to this so
1:04:32
yeah that's a big key of how I was able to like stay strong and not get
1:04:38
distracted and Veer off course was not throwing Pearls of swines and walking in
1:04:45
wisdom in that area how should we approach with our words when they share something bad with
1:04:52
you I don't want to to go out of God's order I want to speak with wisdom and love without dismissing them so I'm not
1:04:58
sure exactly what you mean by bad because that could mean different things but um I'm going to just go with like a
1:05:04
word of death is that if that what you mean like if they're speaking not with faith if they're speaking
1:05:13
um yeah like not with faith they're speaking doubt they're speaking words of death they're agreeing with Devil's lies
1:05:19
then um just listen be loving and listen and then encourage
1:05:25
them but like with spiritual milk maybe not meat like encourage them and say God
1:05:31
is good God is faithful you know may if it's sickness or something byas Stripes you are healed I I believe healing for
1:05:38
you I pray healing for you um you know just be be
1:05:45
encouraging be light speak Faith but you
1:05:51
don't if they're not wanting to receive if they're not open to receive it you don't need to go into a whole teaching
1:05:57
you don't need to teach them super in depth like you're believe in the devil's lies you don't know what you're doing
1:06:03
right now there's power in your words you're you're you're cursing yourself right now like if they don't want to hear that now is not the time but you
1:06:11
can just be loving listen encourage them Speak life but simply and and speak it
1:06:18
out of love and not trying to like teach but just like in the spirit of of love
1:06:26
and um and like just like prayer like you know and you don't have to feel like
1:06:33
you need to contribute with the conversation so much when there's so
1:06:38
much uh Darkness like being said you don't need don't don't be manipulated
1:06:44
like feel comfortable saying little and only speaking life sometimes people want
1:06:51
you to have a pity party with them they want you to engage but you don't need to do that and
1:06:58
you don't need to be manipulated and you can be strong and just speak life and
1:07:05
speak simply and be quiet what to say to people that are not okay so Christine is
1:07:13
asking a question I'm going to kind of rephrase it to like to really phrase it in a way I
1:07:19
think people understand well what to say when people uh don't stand honor because
1:07:25
this is a new wine thing that a new wine principle honor the importance of Honor
1:07:32
that so many people especially in the American Church the western church don't get so what is say what to say to people when they don't understand the principle
1:07:39
of Honor they speak against it um or that also that they don't understand the
1:07:44
principle of being planted like how you can be planted virtually that it's important where you are planted you
1:07:51
shouldn't just church find like the best Church in your your area no find where holy spirit's leading you to be planted
1:07:57
spiritually which sometimes may not be physically especially in the this revival now where God is transforming
1:08:06
his bride so much and there's so many things missing in the church in the body of Christ today that's a serious deal
1:08:14
his anointing we need the anointing in the church um and so we're in the beginnings of this revival there will be
1:08:21
a time coming when it won't be so rare there will be within driving distance
1:08:27
the anointing EV everywhere it will be someday but in person but the beginning
1:08:34
of this revival in this beginning stages is not the case now that doesn't mean
1:08:41
you you need to be living a life without anointing God wants you to have anointing so you can
1:08:47
be planted where uh in a church where God is leading you to be planted in
1:08:54
where his anointing is that is not in your city or your country because it's
1:08:59
the equipping that's happening there it's all spiritual it's not physical it is important sometimes with God's
1:09:04
leading to a visit in person sometimes that is important sometimes but there is Grace it doesn't have to be every week
1:09:12
um there is Grace because it's spiritual the equipping the teaching uh the releasing of the anointing it's all
1:09:19
spiritual just as someone can get delivered just as powerfully through the screen watching online equipping can
1:09:25
happen everything that's happening in the physical church can be happening uh for someone watching across the world so
1:09:32
but many people don't understand that principle I mean people don't get the importance of the anointing of the power
1:09:39
of God and the fful ministry and the the proper equipping that the fful ministry brings that is missing by and large in
1:09:48
most churches today where the Believers are spiritually malnourished only getting milk not having anointed
1:09:56
teaching not transforming staying with demons staying with sicknesses so and
1:10:01
not walking from glory to glory not being equipped to do the works of ministry that Ephesians 4 talks about
1:10:08
not casting out demons and Healing The Sick themselves like they're supposed to be doing walking in God's power however God's calling them to in their life um
1:10:15
many people their eyes aren't open up to this so they don't get that so so yeah so these principles such as honor such
1:10:21
as being planted that old win SK those with old win skin those who are
1:10:26
religious those whose eyes haven't opened up yet they won't get they could speak against So Christine was asking um
1:10:34
what do you say to them so it's the same thing that I shared before don't give your pearls to
1:10:39
swines walk in wisdom to understand that people some people don't want to hear it
1:10:45
they don't want to learn they are prideful and so it's not the time time
1:10:54
to try to teach if they have a genuine heart of wanting to understand then
1:11:02
share with them share with them what you have learned but if they are
1:11:08
coming pridefully like saying you are wrong then in that circumstance just
1:11:18
say I'm following what holy spirit is leading me to I'm following what God has
1:11:23
led me to do um and so um I you know I just appreciate if you respect my faith
1:11:31
and what God is leading me to I respect you you know something along the time terms of that something along the lines
1:11:36
of that you know like it doesn't need to be a whole conversation you don't need to feel like you have to prove to them
1:11:43
you don't need to feel like you need to they're wrong no you're wrong like you don't need to do that because they're
1:11:49
not in the place of receiving it so the best thing you can do is to be the light is to um you know
1:11:57
uh by the fruits they'll know them so um you'll be planting seeds by your
1:12:05
response like a lot of people that are in the old wine skin they don't get it now we're in the beginning stages of
1:12:11
this end time Revival where God is bringing so much transformation so um so many people they don't get it now but
1:12:18
they will later they will later some not all but a lot will get it later like
1:12:24
they they'll be confounded they'll be I mean go God is gonna be God's doing a
1:12:30
lot I mean even now God has given dreams to people get like conviction
1:12:35
dreams he's he's moving and he's going to continue to move he's going to continue to back up himself prove
1:12:43
himself as time goes on as as as as weeks go on months go on years go on
1:12:48
he's going to continue to prove himself he's going to so you'll be
1:12:54
planning seats by your response to these people who have pride and judgment don't
1:13:01
get it how you respond just respond with gentleness with love not judgment towards them why are you judging me
1:13:09
don't be like them don't be prideful be humble be loving be gentle and be like
1:13:16
you know the say like the bigger person like um show that you don't need their
1:13:22
validation you don't need approval of man you don't need their approval you're just after God's approval and so that is
1:13:29
going to be planting seeds that's beautiful fruits um that they will take note of
1:13:35
that they will remember that it'll play a part of their eyes opening up one day realizing they were wrong um
1:13:43
realizing that they were missing it you will play a part with these seeds that you plant with these
1:13:49
responses so I want to declare over all of you um I was reading some of your
