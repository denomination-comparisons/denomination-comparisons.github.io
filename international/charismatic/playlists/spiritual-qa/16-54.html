0:00
is an alter call Old win skin this is a good question
0:09
so in the Bible we don't read anywhere
0:15
about really like what has what tends to be the norm in churches today for the
0:22
most part the norm of alter calls they're called um you know a designated
0:30
time where um a minister says a repetitive kind of kind of in the same
0:37
way message and asks if you would like to give your life to Jesus right now um
0:45
lift your hand or come to the front or and now um we're going to do repeat
0:51
after me prayer and then the minister um does a repeat after me
0:57
prayer and it sounds quite similar like in most churches it's become such a
1:02
tradition like I believe that Jesus died for my sins I believe he rose from the
1:07
grave on the third day it it it's like this same kind of blueprint you know
1:14
that is has been so common um but it actually doesn't say in the Bible that
1:20
we should be doing that at each church church service that we should be doing a repeat after me prayer that we should be
1:27
doing um uh a call for for anyone to lift their hands up or anyone to come
1:32
forward it doesn't say that specifically but there's certain things in the church that have become such
1:38
tradition that people think that if you don't do it that exact way that they've seen done so many times in other
1:46
churches that you are going against the word of God when actually that is not in the word of God
1:53
what is in the word of God is that we are to preach that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then demonstrate the
2:01
kingdom of God to pray for the sick to cast out demons to heal the sick to cast
2:06
out demons this is what we are called to do we are called to make disciples so this is what is is preached
2:14
in the word of what we are supposed to be doing and um some time ago a long time ago someone
2:22
had the Revelation I don't I don't mean that it's um the new wine Revelation but
2:28
they had some revelation some interpretation of the word of God
2:33
where it says preach that the Kingdom of Heaven has come near is at
2:40
hand they they took they they got Revelation from that
2:45
that it should be done like this that it should be done in the way that I just described
2:51
that it would be a repeat after me prayer there would be a call for people to raise their hands or there would be a call for people to come
2:58
forward um they got the Revelation like this is what the scripture means
3:03
apparently must be right and it has been adopted over and over and over
3:09
again in this new wine in this revival that God has brought where he is pouring out his new wine he is removing religion
3:19
old wine skin Traditions that have held people back Traditions aren't bad but
3:25
some traditions can be bad when it's keeping people stuck and in
3:31
religion um so like certain Traditions God does want to break people free from
3:37
them and so like in this revival in in what God has called me to do for example
3:44
is to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit fear the lord to not abide by man's
3:52
Traditions abide by traditions in the church because that's more popular that will make people accept me more Etc but
4:01
instead to go completely by what God is leading me to do as I Minister and one
4:09
of those things that he has led me to do and this is you know by even the I have
4:15
a spiritual father so when I say God is leading me to do so much for the time it's actually from counsel uh from my
4:22
spiritual father but um one of the things that God has led me to do is to
4:28
break from that tradition because a lot of people have been bound by religion by
4:33
that typical alter call Tradition actually me my myself I found myself
4:41
stuck in religion because of that tradition like I would go to church week after week one church at a church I was
4:49
serving at for a while in my early 20s like 10 years ago um that church had
4:56
four Services a day sometimes five Services a day and it would be the same message every service and I would serve
5:03
at every service and I would hear the altar call every
5:10
time and so often I put my hand up so many times I said Lord I want to
5:17
surrender everything but there's something holding me back and
5:23
so now I know it was that the power of God was missing the new wine what was
5:28
needed was the Holy Spirit the power of God to be released in the church through
5:33
the minister so that I could have encounters with Jesus and my spiritual eyes could really open up and meet Jesus
5:39
and in my own accord want to want to surrender to him um but that didn't happen and so when there's not power of
5:47
God but yet there's that tradition that you need to surrender to God you find
5:52
people knowing it's right to surrender to God and going through the motions and raising their hand and saying they
5:58
repeat after me prayer but no change and then comes condemnation I felt that I
6:04
felt a lot of condemnation because I really I would go to church five Services a day sometimes as I was as I
6:12
was serving all day and I would hear that same message and listen to the message each time earnestly and I really
6:19
wanted to surrender but something was blocking me and so when I didn't surrender fully when I wasn't
6:25
surrendering even though I wanted to and I was saying yes I Surrender so much condemnation came and I was just in this
6:31
place of being stuck again and again and again when you're in condemnation that pulls you further away it's St in
6:39
condemnation can never when when you're St in condemnation you can't come closer to Jesus you got to break free from
6:45
condemnation your eyes have to open up to the truth that Jesus does never never condemns so you can reject those lies
6:52
and realize that was never God that was never the truth that condemnation that I was believing in so when I encountered
7:00
God's power when my eyes open up to Jesus through the power of God I was
7:06
moved to surrender everything with all of my heart and I was able to because of
7:11
God's power because of the way my eyes were opened up before I wanted to surrender but mostly because I knew it
7:18
was right you know um but now once my eyes open up because I had encountered
7:23
God's power it's like all of me wanted to surrender it wasn't just because I knew
7:30
it was right I I wanted it more than
7:35
anything every part of me wanted it because my eyes had opened up what's
7:41
needed for the eyes to open up is the power of God and in most cases that
7:47
happens at the church through ministers not always that's the time when eyes open up to to to see who Jesus
7:55
is to have revelation of who he is so that you can be led to surrender but most times it is and that was my case
8:01
this is personal for me I I when I when my eyes opened up when I finally encountered God's power when I was
8:07
baptized in the Holy Spirit I was moved to surrender on my own it wasn't an arranged marriage for the first time for
8:14
the first time it was like yes Jesus from my own heart there was no altar
8:20
call in that moment when I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and when my heart wanted with everything to surrender to
8:26
God there was nobody that asked me there was no minister saying okay now if you
8:31
want to give your life to Jesus raise your hand now or say a repeat after me prayer it was from my own heart and I'm
8:39
so grateful for that it's very personal it was it's very personal and intimate
8:46
I'm so grateful that that was my experience truly surrendering to God so millions of altar calls did not work for
8:52
me did not lead me to surrender it led me to be a lukewarm Christian who was stuck and stuck in religion
9:00
but the power of God being released led me to surrender so altar calls do not
9:06
lead people to Jesus the power of God people having encounters with Jesus Lead
9:12
people to Jesus and true salvation can only happen when a person in their own
9:19
free will chooses Jesus and chooses to surrender their whole lives to Jesus
9:26
that's the only time real salvation will happen so as ministers you know
9:33
ministers who are leading the church services we really need to be focused on
9:38
people's salvation rather than tradition rather than getting numbers and counting
9:44
numbers of hands counting numbers of salvations we can't know who's really
9:50
saved only God knows we can't know who really has surrendered Only God Can
9:56
saying yes I choose Jesus is different from someone choosing to fully surrender
10:02
and go on that narrow road the road is narrow and few find it
10:10
the word of God says not all people are this way but I have seen that I've had such this is how
10:16
many salvations took place you know only God can know that from the heart so if
10:23
we really want to be serious about seeing people be saved come to Faith in
10:29
Jesus and give their lives fully to Jesus instead of focusing on numbers and
10:34
tradition we need to be focusing on releasing the power of God doing what
10:40
God has said which is to preach that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand tell people
10:46
God's power is available he loves you so much that he died for your sins and also
10:51
for you to be healed today you can receive healing and freedom right now we need to be focused on receiving being
10:57
vessels that God can pour out his ano and that he can trust us enough to pour out his anointing upon we need to make
11:03
sure we're being humble and childlike and positioning ourselves to receive impartation of anointing so that we can
11:11
do the job that God has called us to do so people can actually be truly
11:16
saved not this religious salvation truly saved
11:23
Hallelujah so um you find you know that example that I
11:30
gave of me is a great example of what's the state you know I'm not this absolute example it's my personal example and I'm
11:38
glad that God took me through that so I could have a heart for it I could have a passion for it and understanding why we must break free from tradition religious
11:46
tradition um and religion in general and the old wine but this is the state of so
11:51
much of the body of Christ and so this is why specifically God has led me to really Break Free of the tradition Break
11:58
Free of it so often people are they've gone to
12:04
church and when we start doing so much so many familiar religious things it can
12:10
be hard for them to come fresh and new to receive the new they can start going
12:19
into the old ways in their minds it's we got a big job to do to deliver people
12:24
from religion to deliver people from Decades of religion to deliver people from the har harm that religion has
12:30
caused the harm that people who were judgmental you know in the church and of
12:36
condemning that harm that has come upon people you know people in the church
12:41
maybe you they don't even talk about such things as like people struggle with addictions people struggle with porn
12:49
addictions people don't even talk about these things anxiety depression suicidal thoughts and so people carry so much
12:56
shame and maybe if they try to talk about it maybe they've had so much hurt
13:01
from ministers saying well you just you're you're not a good enough Christian in in other words but that's
13:08
how they feel by that by by the answer when they say I'm struggling I can't stop this addiction I don't know what to
13:14
do many times the ministers mentors in the church have been saying well you need to pray more you need to fast more
13:20
you need to do this and this and this and this and have accountability partner
13:25
whatever and but the answer is Deliverance the answer should have been
13:32
Deliverance when someone came to to the minister and they say I don't know what to do I am struggling with this
13:39
depression anxiety Suicidal Thoughts addiction I don't know what to do the answer should have been Deliverance you
13:44
need Freedom you need the power of God to come deliver you that's what you need
13:49
and you know they they needed that love and compassion rather than that religious shame and judgment and giving
13:57
the wrong answer that keeps leading them in this spiral of condemnation and shame and frustration and opposite of knowing
14:05
God's love more feeling like the opposite because like Where's God is how they feel you know anyways th this is
14:12
what God is leading in this new wine you know you know even for me as a minister to be very sensitive to make sure I'm
14:21
not doing anything religious doing anything out of religious tradition in
14:26
any aspect of the service but to be following the lead of the Holy
14:32
Spirit um so at fifel church fifel church it's a place
14:39
where the power of God is released it's a place where people come
14:45
to have encounters with Jesus for them to in their own heart in
14:52
their own timing give their lives to Jesus with their own words not me
14:58
putting words in you not me prematurely um trying to force you to
15:04
come to Jesus not me making you feel pressured to come to Jesus but as a
15:11
leader me releasing God's power his love so you can meet Jesus and have your own
15:19
relationship with him decide to have your own relationship with him and decide to surrender everything to him so
15:24
that's the that's how God wants people to be led into salvation not through
15:31
religion but by his power by his love but this religion out
15:38
there is crazy this religious spirit it is crazy I've
15:43
seen you know it it's crazy how much they get um they miss Jesus it's just
15:49
like the times of Jesus here Jesus was God In the Flesh
15:55
whom these Pharisees and Sadducees have been worshiping and serving for their whole lives and their
16:02
ancestors for Generations have been serving and here God comes in the flesh through Jesus and they completely miss
16:09
him they completely miss him because he's not doing things he's not doing
16:14
Church he's not doing Ministry how they had been doing
16:20
it um you know so even like at at um at
16:27
fifel church and at events that I minister at um really what God is asking
16:32
of me is to do what I just shared God is is NE has never spoken to me you need to
16:39
specifically call people to give their lives to Jesus he he's never you know because remember we're trying to break
16:46
free from that religious tradition so much um and to be to be saved is simply
16:51
to believe in your heart and just and confess with your mouth it can be as simple as Jesus I believe in you
16:59
I want to give my life to you that's you're saved it doesn't come
17:04
through a repeat after me prayer that's a specific word specific sentences you know you don't have to say I believe
17:10
that you died on the cross for my sins and on the third day we're raised from the grave and I you don't have to say
17:17
all those words to be saved it's all about the heart um Jesus I
17:24
believe I Surrender I give my life to you that's it saved you know and so people aren't robots
17:31
they God wants them to have a real relationship and so when they encounter God and when their eyes open up and they
17:37
decide they want to give their life to Jesus they can do it that's what God wants um but even so there I I I always
17:45
encourage people to surrender to God it's not something that God you know instructed me like you have to make sure
17:52
you you know speak these words call people to give their lives to me no
17:58
because as I said we're breaking free from this religious tradition however I I do always encourage people to
18:04
surrender I encourage people to surrender to Jesus pretty much every service and um sometimes uh it's for two
18:14
reasons one it's so important to surrender so that God can deliver you it's part of giving God authority to
18:21
come and have his way with you especially some people they have in their minds I want one-on-one prayer but that's not God's plan of how he he wants
18:28
to deliver you it maybe just through a word or just his anointing coming and
18:33
touching you so I encourage people so that they don't miss out on their deliverance and also I encourage people to surrender and also just in general to
18:41
surrender to surrender your lives to Jesus so I say it you know I do say it not that I have to by God you know he's
18:47
I mean God said you have to say encourage people to surrender you know um but even so I've had just so I've had
18:57
a lot of people attack me even saying she didn't do an altar call and so she's
19:02
not of God or we're closing this door um
19:07
did uh when what's Wild is like I actually did call people to surrender to
19:12
Jesus so it's it's just wild how these Traditions these man-made
19:18
traditions of this repeat after me prayer thing that's nowhere in the Bible
19:24
it's become this doctrine that people think is in the Bible and it's not um because
19:34
to me I mean alter call I think that's the the real meaning is inviting people to together their lives to Jesus so for me to say I invite you all surrender
19:41
your lives to Jesus to me that is an alter call but just different wording of
19:48
what people are used to you know so um that was a big explanation to that
19:55
question is an altar called the the old wine so I mean
20:02
yes yes so I do know that when we
20:08
are rid of religion rid of religion but truly truly
20:15
demonstrating God's power releasing God's power and his love I truly believe way more people are being saved truly
20:23
saved than the religious alter call prayers
20:29
even if people are saying this thousands of people salvations you know and so this is where
20:37
God wants our heart our he wants our heart our Focus to be on people truly
20:42
being saved not numbers and religiously being saved amen if we are managers or
20:51
leads at work how can we encourage the team encouraging others with scripture is typically not allowed you know when I
20:58
I preach a sermon when I preach a sermon even what I just preached right now what
21:05
I just preached even on the subscriber q&as I'm preaching the word of God I'm preaching Revelation from the word of
21:11
God I'm preaching what Holy Spirit speaking to me without like reading the
21:18
Bible right here right but I'm I'm speaking prophetically I'm speaking of
21:24
the word of God I mentioned a scripture in that last um answer uh how we are
21:31
called to preach saying that the Kingdom of Heaven has come near and to kill the
21:37
sick and to cast out demons and the scripture about how we just need to believe just you all who have faith in
21:43
Jesus will be saved and all who call in the name of Jesus right but um I didn't say this specific uh scripture I don't
21:51
have it before me it's just in my heart but so much of that answer was I wasn't just reading a Bible
21:57
the whole time is my point so you can be encouraging your team like in a in a
22:04
secular way with Biblical themes you know you don't have to say Jesus or God but you know themes messages are super
22:12
biblical like to messages like um put others before
22:17
yourself uh you know that we are working United as a team and that's how we will
22:24
succeed you know and to have a positive attitude and to uplift others and
22:29
encourage others and to work hard and with Excellence like all of these things
22:36
that I'm sharing are literally in the Bible so you can be speaking these things and you are encouraging them with
22:43
the word of God without them knowing it and it's it's having an effect it's planting seeds and it's it'll be drawing them to
22:52
you because the word of God is full of light and so like these messages these themes of the Bible are full of light
22:59
and truth and a person can recognize that really they can recognize light
23:04
they can recognize truth even if they don't like it or don't want to agree with it and so that seeds being planted
23:11
and that will that's your light shining and it will be powerful seeds that will
23:16
lead them to want to hear from you more and learn why you are this way or why
23:22
you have this advice that you do Amen in the spiritual real does the
23:28
enemy know everyone's calling no the enemy does not know a lot of things he
23:34
just know what he knows is the history he knows like he can see patterns he can
23:40
see you know if he sees someone has a heart like David if he sees someone you
23:46
know who has these special hearts that are similar to the hearts of
23:52
the people of God throughout the word of God then he can have a inkling oh this
23:58
person person may be a powerful vessel of God
24:03
so but that's not ank knowing but it you know he's been around for a long time so
24:09
he can have that kind of insight um more than a lot of Christians
24:17
can you know it's like he's a spirit and he's been around for a long time so he really he knows spiritual things that's
24:24
why we have to take it so seriously not being a baby Christian but being mature
24:29
that's the only way we'll have victory over the enemy because he wins in the spirit he the way he wins over a person
24:36
I mean the way he um has Victory bringing attacks in things it's all
24:42
having to do with the spiritual realm like his knowledge in the spiritual realm is is like greater than yours um
24:50
well and can also will also be that the person by by yours I don't mean you I
24:55
mean the person isn't totally surrendered so when we're surrendered to God that also means that we are going to
25:02
be growing and being true disciples and growing in the spirit every day so the
25:08
more we grow in the spirit the more we level up to know how the spiritual realm Works
25:15
know the schemes of the devil and so the devil can't defeat us anymore by the spiritual realities truths that we are
25:22
blind to amen so anyways the devil knows the
25:28
past um the devil knows spiritual principles and then the devil knows
25:36
what is spoken not that every not that he's he can't hear everybody speaking at
25:41
one time because he's not om omnipotent omnipresent like how God is God can be
25:47
everywhere at one time but the devil can only be one place at one time but he has
25:52
a kingdom he has demons and so they're kind of like spies like they report to
25:59
um the in the Kingdom they report the demons report so
26:04
um like if a demon is in somebody then a person's speaking things
26:11
the demon could hear that but if you are when you're set free you are protected
26:19
uh it's like a demon can't just like come in your room and listen to you so
26:24
your your prayers to God are protected except for when a person starts to speak
26:30
negative when a person starts to speak Negative they they're speaking on the devil's frequency so just anytime we are
26:37
going against God's word it's dangerous anytime it's like when we are surrendered when we're going when we're
26:44
being obedient to God's word devil doesn't have a shot we are we
26:50
are protected we are covered when we start going against the word of God speaking words of
26:55
death the devil can start to have ways to to hear what we're speaking you're going into the devil's frequency like a
27:02
radio and it can start to be heard what's being spoken so when a person that's why when a person speaks so many
27:09
negative words over themselves then a demonic oppression can come but that's starting with you speaking on the
27:15
devil's on the the frequency of the devil and now it's seeing oh this person is giving authority to the devil oh this
27:22
person is opening up the door okay so demons can be sent here that's kind of
27:28
that's like what's happening in the spiritual realm so that that's all he knows that's all
27:34
he knows um I I shared this recently you know like when prophecies are spoken
27:41
like to a church when things are spoken publicly also it's like some people have
27:47
some people are oppressed with demons who are present and then they are cast out but if it's spoken publicly it can
27:52
be heard that's nothing nothing wrong with that it's okay for the devil to know things he can't do anything about
28:00
it when it's really God's will when it's God's will for something to happen even if the devil knows what like
28:07
the plan is what the prophecy is he can't stop it he can try but he can't stop it but that we need to walk in
28:13
wisdom like we're not supposed to say everything that God has revealed like publicly only in the timing only what
28:21
God has said it's okay to reveal this because then the devil could bring attacks that we weren't meant to to go
28:30
through type thing that's why Deliverance is 911 we we just got to go
28:38
come and get free come and get free it's it's emergency it's that's why at 5f
28:44
church is not like okay we're only doing Deliverance once a month that's why Deliverance has taken place every time
28:51
that's why in the time of Jesus ministering he was constantly casting out demons he wasn't like okay we're not
28:57
casting out demons today no those who were oppressed he set them free how do I
29:02
know the difference between feeling convicted versus condemnation can you explain how to know the difference please when you have sinned when you
29:11
have opened a door when you have stepped out of God's will conviction will come conviction is
29:19
simply God speaking it can also just be not necessarily mean like all of a sudden
29:25
there's a voice speaking but sometimes it's just wisdom sometimes it's just you know you did wrong and you know God
29:32
doesn't want you to continue in this he wants you to repent that's that can be conviction too so conviction can happen
29:39
different ways it can be all of a sudden God's voice comes but but usually it
29:45
should God shouldn't have to speak something extra you should have conscience you should know right from
29:51
wrong and you should have that wisdom that knowing that conscience that morale
29:56
the morals to know I shouldn't have done this God
30:01
doesn't want me to continue with this I need to repent uh so that's conviction and you
30:11
know when God speaks it whether it's his voice speaking it
30:19
like I maybe if you are just um need a wakeup call and you didn't
30:25
really realize that was wrong that was prideful or something the Holy Spirit
30:31
can come and speak that to you like in a still Small Voice for example or a dream or you're reading the word of God and he
30:38
speaks through the word of God or through Rama word through like me speaking for example and God speaks
30:45
through that to you um so whether it's that the way that the conviction from God is coming or the con or or the
30:52
conviction from God is coming from just your wisdom like your conscience you
30:57
know I shouldn't have done that it's God either way it's God bringing conviction but um in either case it's really just
31:05
matter of fact it's really just it's simply matter of fact it's simply like that was
31:13
wrong you should not be continuing this you need to repent and go this way the
31:20
narrow road way following the word of God way it conviction is just a simple
31:26
matter OFA thing conviction is also um brings the fear of God like whether
31:34
it's God that's that's speaking it like in the ways I described or just you knowing this was wrong there should be a
31:42
fear of God there should be sorry a sorry when you make a mistake you know
31:47
whether it's you made an honest innocent mistake you know that you didn't mean
31:53
to that affected a person or you made a mistake towards the guy God by disobeying him anytime you should say
32:01
you should feel sorry and you should say I am
32:08
sorry this is humility and people have a problem with this and it really hurts
32:14
the person more that you've hurt if it's a person and God by you not simply saying I'm sorry it makes them feel not
32:21
loved also it's not showing love to God so both for a person and to God it's
32:26
it's not showing love it's it's showing that I it's showing I don't really care that I made a mistake and it harmed you
32:33
in some way and that makes a person feel bad that also is not showing love to God
32:38
I find this a lot is is very common in Christians it's Pride when you have made
32:44
a mistake when you have messed up it can be you didn't mean to at all but we're do we all make mistakes the humble and
32:51
loving thing to do is to say I'm sorry very important because when we
32:58
don't do this it's hanging on to Pride a lot of people haven't like well I didn't mean to it was just an honest mistake so
33:06
I don't need to say sorry that's Pride so first of all whenever um conviction
33:12
should come with the fear of God with with sorry with a sorry with a I feel
33:17
sorry remorse with remorse there we go there's the word with remorse and so so
33:23
whether it's a person or to God that you've made a mistake or both both you should say I am sorry you should mean
33:31
the sorry and you should say I am sorry whether and and this is for people and for God you can make an honest mistake
33:37
you didn't mean to you didn't knowingly sin you didn't knowingly make a mistake that affected the other person um say
33:43
sorry all right um and then when we're talking about in Disobedience towards
33:48
God you just you repent you just change the direction repent means to turn
33:53
direction so you're going this way now you turn into God's will you just come and that's it and you should have you
34:02
should make more of an intention now to not make that mistake again you you
34:08
should amplify your passion to be obedient because you saw how you it's
34:15
like you want to make up for I mean God wipes away your sins but you should have the heart that you want to make up for it that you want to
34:22
um yeah I mean ju like do more for God do more in excellence for God
34:28
amen cuz he's worthy so that's conviction and that's
34:35
how repentance should take place notice there was no kind of condemnation there there was
34:41
remorse remorse just simply means I'm sorry I made a mistake and I
34:48
wish I didn't do that I you earnestly feel this way but it's more of just like
34:54
a rem remorse is different than condemnation all right just remorse and it shouldn't
35:00
be lasting for a long time you have remorse true remorse you say I am sorry
35:06
and you mean that I'm sorry and then you repent that's how God wants it to be
35:11
repentance to be not some pity party sad Fest for a week because you made the
35:19
mistake yes have remorse feel sorry say sorry that's important or else you're
35:25
going to keep making the same mistakes you got to really feel sorry and say sorry um but move on move on it's
35:32
gone that's how God sees it and he wants you to see it that way okay but
35:37
condemnation is like well it comes from the devil first of all the Bible says there's no there's therefore no
35:43
condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus so first of all it comes from the devil never God uh and so when you're
35:50
condemning yourself you're actually listening to the enemy's lie the enemy is
35:55
coming as the angel of Light like disg guising himself as an angel of Light trying to play God trying to make you
36:01
think it's the voice of God coming with this condemnation so condemnation is like how could you I can't you know
36:09
you're so bad you're not a good enough Christian God is so mad at you you just can't do anything right you've messed up
36:17
again like all of these kinds of thoughts condemnation wants you to sulk all day condemnation wants you to stay
36:23
in wallow it wants you to feel bad all day um
36:28
the spirit of condemnation so that doesn't help anybody it definitely doesn't help the kingdom of God because
36:34
we need to be living in the truth living in our living the truth in our mind remember what I spoke about this past
36:40
Sunday the power of your thinking your mind your mind and your your words are
36:48
what shape the future or what is what you you what makes you to co to partner
36:54
with God and bring about what he wants you to bring about with him on this Earth so if
37:00
your mind's not right you're not going to do what God wants you to do uh so a
37:07
lot of people they think the condemnation is like paying for it making up for it or something for you to
37:13
like victim like wallowing in pain of condemnation no you're it's it's to stay
37:21
in condemnation is actually more Disobedience it's more Disobedience you know we because we have to
37:28
we have to choose to believe the word of God we have to choose to renew our minds we have to choose to reject the lies of
37:33
the devil if you're not rejecting the lies of the devil that's Disobedience you know you're staying in
37:40
this place where you're not effective for God you're staying stuck out of your own choice God wants to use you to to to
37:47
do many powerful things and now he can't all because you're choosing to stay in condemnation that's Disobedience
37:53
so carry that in your heart because that will help you that will help help
38:00
encourage you to stop listening to that voice of condemnation
38:07
amen yeah so um it's really quite simple whenever you
38:12
if you make a mistake know that usually those two voices will come God's voice devil's
38:19
voice conviction and condemnation they'll probably usually they come together and you have to reject
38:25
condemnation and you have to re really accept that conviction don't reject both you got to
38:32
accept the conviction um so you can
38:38
repent amen is this an Open Door believing that all bad things would happen to
38:43
me bad incidents that happen or bad words spoken by people yes anytime that you are
38:50
continuing to to believe continuing to meditate on something that's not true
38:57
that's an Open Door yes yes what you're doing in your mind can absolutely be open doors so what you
39:05
need to do is reject the negative words the things you believed in the bad
39:10
things you believed were going to happen to you you need to reject that you need to renounce partnering with those thoughts and believing in
39:17
them and God will set you free and I detach you from all that right now and I
39:23
break every word curse spoken over you word of death I break it and now I
39:28
declare every spirit of fear every Spirit of death every spirit of
39:34
destruction must leave now in Jesus name and I declare none of those bad things
39:40
that you believe would happen to you can happen to you in jesus' name
39:46
amen how can we recognize the angel of Light I have a
39:51
teaching on this what is it called though it's not called angel of Light if
39:57
someone remembers please write it in the comments I remember it was a live stream
40:03
I did maybe a couple months ago a few months ago three months ago or something but I just share that because I've gone
40:09
in depth with that question but I want to answer it a little bit right now how to recognize
40:18
the angel of Light there's a different ways the angel of Light can come the
40:23
biggest way that the angel of Light comes is when a person has Pride
40:29
so if you can really humble yourself that you'll never be deceived
40:36
by the angel of Light that is the quick answer um you know here's an
40:43
example the Disciples of Jesus those who came to believe in
40:49
Jesus they were humble all of them were
40:55
humble the pure in heart shall see God the Bible says the pure in heart shall
41:01
see God the pure The Humble shall see God their eyes will be open to see this
41:07
is God not this this not this over here this not this person claiming to be from
41:12
God but they're not this is God they could see this is Jesus and it didn't matter what the
41:19
Pharisees were saying what the Sadducees were saying they were the respectful people of those times people of God
41:25
teachers leaders uh at those times and they were saying Jesus was a false prophet and all this
41:31
didn't matter the pure in heart shall see God these disciples could could see in the spiritual realm these people are
41:38
wrong they are speaking from the spirit of the enemy I mean they the enemy is
41:43
speaking to them with the angel of Light and they they could see it this is God Jesus is Lord they could see that all
41:50
right now now we see the Pharisees and Sadducees they were completely deceived by the angel of Light there could be a
41:57
range of like what was behind their
42:03
actions but the biggest thing was what one of the big things was angel of Light
42:09
deceiving them because you remember the Pharisees and Sadducees crucified Jesus
42:14
in the name of God like they didn't do it because Jesus was a criminal they
42:23
they they went to they crucified Jesus because they believed they were serving God same
42:29
with Apostle Paul before he be before he was Paul when he was Saul he was killing Christians because he believed God was
42:38
calling him to kill these people who he believed were false prophets were
42:43
leading people away from God but Paul had the same problem as
42:48
Paul well Saul before Paul Saul had the same problem as the Pharisees and Sadducees Pride God had to Humble him
42:55
God had to the the Bible says that God uh humbles those who who exalt themselves so he had to Humble Saul who
43:03
then became Paul because he wasn't humbling himself and as soon as he was humble because of God humbling him he
43:10
could see God and he could see the truth you know anyways with the Pharisees and
43:16
Sadducees there was a range of things okay um some of them could have and and
43:22
what I'm speaking today is the same or what I'm speaking now is the same today is the same way people are today it's a
43:29
range of why people crucify true Servants of God or not crucify but um
43:34
persecute true moves of God true Servants of God it's a range of things some are so evil in heart like full of
43:43
jealousy and hatred they know someone's of God but they've allowed the enemy to
43:49
overtake them and they become really fake there's a scripture I read this
43:55
past Wednesday that says 1 John 1: 15 if we say that we have fellowship with him
44:00
and walk in darkness we lie and we do not practice the truth so this scripture says God is in
44:09
God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and
44:14
we do not practice truth so it tells us that there can be Believers that lie and do not practice truth because they're
44:20
walking in some Darkness there are definitely there were in the time of Jesus and today people who who go to
44:28
church they preach the gospel sometimes uh and seem like a great Christian but in their heart they carry darkness of
44:35
jealousy they carry darkness of Pride and ego and selfish ambition and they
44:41
can know someone's of God but persecute them that happens today I've seen it
44:46
happen in my own life and that happened in the times of Jesus so you have you have that and then you have others who
44:53
were deceived by the angel of Light you have others who who do have pride and
44:58
jealousy and selfish ambition and that causes them to be blinded so much that
45:05
now they're fully hearing from the the angel of Light and they may hear conviction sometimes saying no Jesus is
45:12
truly from God look at all the fruits but they push it down and they really
45:17
choose to believe in the angel of Light but it it varies like there's some people that they're not even pushing the
45:24
conviction down like they know they knew Jesus was truly of God same for today
45:30
but they're acting in evil knowingly but then you have others who
45:35
are just they're hearing the conviction but they push it down and they're like no that's the devil no that's the devil
45:43
I've I've heard people you know say I had a you know I had a dream about
45:49
Katherine cek and this this whole dream about how how I'm false and all of that
45:55
and it's like well the devil can send dreams you know but they are they are choosing to they want their the pride
46:02
and jealousy and selfish ambition makes them want to want to hear the angel of
46:07
Light rather than God's voice so it's varying someone can be like so they can
46:14
have a a a pretty good heart but they have um pride in some areas maybe
46:20
they're just holding on maybe it's not jealousy maybe they're just they have a
46:25
love for religious tradition or something you know or they're just stubborn to want to accept God moving in
46:32
a new way uh so it's not necessarily jealousy but there is a pride in that
46:38
kind of area so any way there's Pride there can be pride in all these different
46:43
forms there can be Pride just because you're wealthy your family is wealthy
46:48
there can be Pride just because you come from um uh you know you're a pastor's
46:54
kid so you're like a celebrity in the church or something like that you know you grow up that way and there can be
47:00
Pride there there's not jealousy there's not selfish there's not other things but
47:06
there's pride pride manifests itself in different ways and so people are
47:11
deceived by the angel of light when there is pride one of the big ways that people
47:19
are deceived by the angel of Light is hearing God's voice one of the biggest ways that God
47:27
speaks is through people through vessels specifically through the fful ministry
47:33
even more specifically through your anointed and appointed leader Shepherd
47:40
spiritual mother or spiritual father through teachings and at times at times
47:45
maybe you need to ask the personal question um once in a great while
47:51
perhaps not always most of the times the answers like on this live are given to
47:57
you um through teachings but that's the major way of hearing God's voice when it
48:04
comes to Direction when it comes to Revelation
48:10
from God's word uh that's where it's coming from
48:16
not intimacy with Holy Spirit intimacy with holy spirit is you and holy spirit
48:22
without the word of God having to come forth through someone else it Can it can
48:28
like I I can speak a word right now that you needed to hear and you were you were
48:33
like Lord you just spoke to me right now and you feel intimacy you know sometimes
48:38
that intimacy and relationship with God that you share can absolutely come like
48:44
through as like God speaks through a vessel and you have that intimacy through what he spoke through the vessel
48:50
but um many people are like you don't need a person to hear God you don't need a hear you don't need another person to
48:57
hear God's voice when it comes to intimacy relationship personal
49:02
relationship with God which is looking like you reading the word and hearing
49:09
God in the word from your prayer time and not just uh like set aside prayer
49:15
time but throughout the day um communion with God but so much of that is going to
49:21
be simple so much of that is going to be um including God in your day is going to
49:26
to be hearing him say I love you or Renewing Your Mind to hear him say I love you I'm proud of you um and you
49:33
saying I love you back but when we're talking about uh opening your spiritual
49:39
eyes and feeding you spiritual truth revelation of the word of God the new
49:45
wine and also Direction especially like like prophetic direction for the the
49:51
body of Christ that's going to be coming through uh Servants of God through specifically your your leader but so
49:59
many people they they don't see their leaders that way they they go to church and they they go and they see their
50:06
their leader as just like a podcast episode you know like I don't know if
50:13
like in a person's life they're like oh yeah I feel like um getting a little
50:18
knowledge here on this podcast today like very casual and not with respect
50:24
you know and so when they hear that word of God coming from their teacher they just they treat it so lightly and
50:30
casually um but they they feel like the bulk of how they hear God how they hear
50:36
God speak directionally and um giving Revelation is just with no vessel that's
50:46
how a lot of people think in the church today that's the old wine that's the old wine and it the devil loves when people
50:52
are that way that's how the angel of Light comes big time Big time so the
50:59
main way that God um speaks by the way for daytoday
51:05
decisions the main way is coming from wisdom the main way won't usually be
51:13
from just a voice that comes and the reason why is because the enemy can so
51:19
easily bring a voice a thought and God is so good and he doesn't want you to he
51:27
doesn't want to speak to you through this like this voice one day and then
51:32
the next day the devil speaks to you in the same exact way disguising himself in Israel light and so you you follow God
51:38
one day and you follow the devil one way that's why God has set it up this way this way that I'm describing to you
51:44
right now you get the revelation of the word of God of God's kingdom of God's
51:49
ways and getting wisdom in general through teachings primarily from
51:55
your leader leaders and when you receive that you now receive
52:02
wisdom here's a great example I just taught in the beginning I taught the Revelation about like alter calls so now
52:10
now you you just received wisdom okay so now when you're out and about and you
52:16
start talking to to somebody about God there can be a thought that can come
52:23
from religion old ways like you need to lead them into repeat after me prayer
52:29
right now or else they could go to hell like you have to do this right now they won't be saved you know you can just
52:35
hear these voices or if you don't do it you walk away feeling so condemned but
52:41
you've received wisdom from that word that that God released on me and so now
52:47
you know the decisions to make in this situation with this person now you are
52:52
planting seeds you're talking about God you're sharing your testimony you're inviting them to church but you know to walk in wisdom that you
52:58
don't want to push religion on them this person has been harmed by religion a lot you don't want to be pouring old wine
53:05
upon them and leading them further away from God no walk in wisdom plant seeds
53:11
show love be be patient be gentle and
53:17
don't bring all of that religious stuff you know that's an example of what I mean okay so you know like this whole
53:24
live just wisdom is coming in you wisdom is being put in you you're being fed
53:29
you're being spiritually fed Hallelujah I Feel the Fire of God you're being spiritually fed wisdom is coming in you and so
53:39
anyways the main way that God is speaking in day-to-day situations is by
53:44
what he's spoken that's become wisdom remember in the Bible wisdom is referred
53:50
to as the Holy Spirit uh so wisdom isn't this like other thing wisdom is God
53:57
is God in you Holy Spirit in you and so you have this wisdom in you you have this truth of God the word of God in you
54:03
and so this situation comes in life and wisdom is speaking if you listen to it
54:08
if you renew your mind and so you'll know what to do now in this
54:15
situation that's the Safe Way biggest way that you hear God but most people
54:20
don't realize this they're not valuing the teachings released and so they're
54:25
not even getting wisdom and they're relying on flippant thoughts to come in their head that
54:33
it'll be God and so this is what happens God speaks sometimes many times actually not many times he wants you to many
54:39
times he's not coming with this random thought out of nowhere but he actually wants you to find him in his word and
54:45
find him through the word released through the teachings so many times you know people are following the angel of
54:51
Light because it's thought thought thought thought here uh or coming through signs I've shared this I've
54:57
shared a testimony before in my my life before where I at one time I thought to hear God's voice I would always see it
55:02
through through coincidences so my eyes were locked on coincidences and so then one time the devil saw that I was doing
55:08
that and he he um he used that and he came as an angel of Light and I almost
55:15
got myself in a very dangerous situation long story short I was um this was this
55:20
was in like this is when I this was like 2014 13 2014 I think when I came out
55:28
here to pursue acting and then actually music I was pursuing music and um I was I'm just giving you
55:36
an example of the angel of Light right now I'm going to share a story practical example I was wondering when am I
55:42
supposed to do next to in my in my pursuit of the music career I'm stuck I don't know what to do next what should I
55:48
do next I was really hungering to know like the next step I should take and I
55:53
went to a coffee shop that day and there was a gentleman um that I've seen at the
55:59
church before that I would go to but I never felt I felt I didn't I felt kind
56:05
of red flags about this person you know just I just there's just something off where I just basically wisdom was
56:11
telling me you shouldn't trust this person you shouldn't like take their words with great value you don't really know this person and you don't have
56:18
reason to really like trust them to speak over your life you know but out of nowhere this person just said hi and
56:24
it's a big city and I ran into this person out of it's LA and I just ran into this person the coffee shop so all
56:30
of a sudden um angel of Light is speaking to me coincidence God speaks to
56:36
you through coincidences this must be God and I'm hearing this like well I
56:42
don't know about this person though but I I push it down because at that point I
56:48
didn't have wisdom and so a little voice but looking back I remember that little
56:53
voice and that was that little voice of wisdom trying to peek through um and then uh so he said to me he said
57:00
you know what you need you need an investor this was so Random like an investor into my music career or
57:06
something I never thought about but I don't even know anything I never even heard that I was just wondering what my
57:11
next step to do is I don't know and so he spoke it like prophetically it seemed
57:17
and so I was like this must be God I was just thinking today I need
57:23
direction and now I see him him this person I know in LA and he out of
57:29
nowhere prophesies this whoa and so then I go to another coffee shop Cafe um a
57:36
little bit later and I'm writing a song for my friend for she was getting married and I wrote a song for her and
57:42
her husband and I was writing and I was concentrating you know scowling concentrating and all of a sudden this
57:49
person from a table nearby he he he interrupts me and he says something rude like if you keep sculling like that
57:56
it'll stay like that now that should have been kind of a red flag too like oh well that wasn't very nice you
58:04
know but um I didn't have this wisdom that I do now at that time so instead
58:09
I'm like woo coincidences I called them God Winks at the time and um by the way God speaks
58:16
their coincidences but we need to follow wisdom rather than signs rather than Winks rather than the way that we want
58:23
to only rather than God can only speak this way or this is my favorite way that God speaks or that that that's that's
58:30
how the angel of Light will start to speak when we're uh not obedient to
58:35
allow God to speak however he wants um so then this person just starts
58:41
talking to me out of nowhere and this never really happened um and he says I'm
58:46
an investor out of nowhere he says this do you see the devil's strategy and all
58:52
this came from the devil noticing how I wasn't walking in wisdom how I was being foolish thinking
59:00
this is the only way to hear God you know um it was totally a strategy of the devil and um but there was like red
59:08
signs about this guy I could really see it but I at the time just suppressed it because I'm just thinking this must be
59:14
God because of the coincidence and uh long story short he ends up saying yeah
59:20
I have produced all these big singers and everything um I would love to bring
59:26
you to a studio right now and introduce you to people in the industry and something like that and so I ended up
59:32
getting in a car with him this was so foolish but I didn't have wisdom back then this was years before I was
59:38
surrendered to God and met my spiritual father I was in that lukewarm church that I was talking about where it was the same alter call all the time um and
59:46
no change in my life um and I got in a car with him and um and then he he he
59:52
tried to end up forcing himself forcing me to kiss him and I was able to get out of the car and God saved me but it could
1:00:01
have been so much worse than that and all of that was was not walking in
1:00:06
wisdom and listening to the angel of Light rather than God's voice you know
1:00:12
so this is just an example I give and this is so many people they just want to go with thoughts and um coincidences and
1:00:21
these things that are not having to do with wisdom that comes from teachings
1:00:27
and so I I've never I remember that day thinking like I've
1:00:33
never I've never felt like the devil coming at me like that in my life
1:00:39
like how he came towards Eve like trying to entice me and trying to get me to compromise and do things and I thank God
1:00:47
that he saved me but um that's an example that's an example of
1:00:53
um the angel of Light and and so we see so much of this in the body of Christ whether it's just relying on hearing
1:01:01
God's voice so much on your own and being misled by the angel of
1:01:06
Light so many people are saying God told me this God told me this God told me this and so much of it's not the case so
1:01:13
much of it's angel of Light so much of it's just your own mind what you meditate on becomes like strong rigid
1:01:21
thoughts in your mind if you're meditating on something it will it will be as a man thinks so he
1:01:29
is like you think on something you look at something a lot and it will start to be like strong concrete thoughts in your
1:01:36
mind and so if somebody's focusing on something that isn't the word of God something then this these thoughts can
1:01:45
be created they can come from the devil or sometimes it's just created in your own mind and you think people think it
1:01:52
is God and they're LED astray the biggest way to not be deceived by
1:02:00
the angel of Light is to humble yourself and to not be uh to to be okay with
1:02:05
being a child in God's kingdom to being not a know-it-all but a kindergartener
1:02:11
and when you come into the new wine you need to become like a kindergartener you
1:02:16
need to become like so empty and like
1:02:26
throw like surrendering all of these doctrines surrendering all of this
1:02:31
knowledge because a lot of it is old wine a lot of it's not not the truth a
1:02:39
lot of it's holding you back so you have to surrender that
1:02:45
and and and allow God to teach you little by
1:02:50
little you have to lay down being a professional and hearing God's voice he
1:02:55
comes in a still Small Voice much of the time and and there's many people that are
1:03:03
saying God told me this God told me this God told me this and they are believing that God's speaking to them in the earthquake and the wind and the fire all
1:03:09
the time and that's the angel of Light and they are completely missing the still Small Voice the big way that God
1:03:15
is speaking on a regular basis is simple I love you I'm proud of you keep doing what I've told you to do I'm with you
1:03:22
that's the main things that God's speaking each day I mean the the work of the kingdom is so
1:03:29
simple and we're trying to make our relationships with God so much more
1:03:35
exciting sometimes exciting sometimes or something or we're trying to people are trying to feel more
1:03:41
spiritual you know people are trying to have like the amount of transfiguration experiences and burning bush experiences
1:03:48
like every single day when so much of it is mundane but amazing like so much of it is just
1:03:55
showing up every day consistently doing what God has called you to do partnering with him to do what he is calling you to
1:04:04
do that's so much of it and so when God is saying do this for me I have work for
1:04:09
you to do for my kingdom today and then tomorrow he's saying the same thing um he's focused on his work he wants you to
1:04:16
be focused on his work he's he's not going to be talking about a million different things he he wants
1:04:23
you to be built up so you can build others up he wants you to be built up so you can be the best vessel of God you
1:04:29
can be so he's going to be speaking I love you I'm proud of you encouraging you um but he's probably not going to
1:04:36
ask you how you liked the episode of friends you know
1:04:42
he's like I I sometimes we can protract so much of our relationship with
1:04:51
friends with with our personal friends and we're talking about all these worldly things I don't mean like
1:04:58
um I I don't mean like demonic worldly things I mean just like things that
1:05:03
aren't spiritual just we talk and talk with friends and we expect God to just
1:05:09
be chitchatting about all these same things when God is so serious and
1:05:15
passionate about his work and he wants your heart to be there not that you can't have rest and have hobbies and he
1:05:22
cares about you to have uh uh those things and desires of your heart you know and he's with you there you like to
1:05:29
hike he likes to he loves that you enjoy it enjoy enjoy his creation and wants you to bring him in on that you know I
1:05:35
don't mean you know he doesn't care about those things but he's so
1:05:41
passionate about his his children about his kingdom work and he wants that to be
1:05:47
in your heart so strong so strongly every day and that's simple like his
1:05:53
kingdom work is simple so
1:05:58
um I believe what will free a lot of people from hearing the angel of Light being deceived by the angel of Light is
1:06:04
to receive what I'm sharing with you about stop trying to put pressure on
1:06:09
yourself or thinking that God is speaking so many different things all
1:06:16
the time or maybe you've had other relationships with people I know this was my case in the past where someone's
1:06:22
like I had this Vision I had this God told me this profound thing God told me this it's like whoo and you feel like
1:06:28
you heard nothing and maybe you felt this happened to me you know I before I
1:06:34
received the prophecy over my life before I walked into the anointing you know I I would feel insecure about my relationship with God I would close my
1:06:41
eyes and meditate and pray and wait and for God to give me this wild Vision like
1:06:47
other people were sharing they were having and wait for God to speak in an audible voice not really I wasn't
1:06:52
expecting an audible voice but you know wait for had to speak something so strong and profound in this wild
1:06:59
Revelation and um I wouldn't see it happen I would like close my eyes and
1:07:04
wait and then condemnation would come like well all these other people are saying God told me this God told me this
1:07:10
God told me this God told me this God gave me this huge Vision maybe something's wrong with you maybe you're
1:07:16
you're not stealing your mind enough maybe you're not waiting enough and all of that was wrong all of it was old wine
1:07:24
when I stepped into the anointing and and became a spiritual daughter of M
1:07:31
spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy my eyes just opened up to all this that I'm
1:07:36
sharing um just even seeing his life and his example and and everything God really
1:07:44
spoke so much to me on this subject um to really solidify it and confirm it you
1:07:50
know seeing through his life and Ministry and fruits like this is the way just to end about
1:07:56
to close on this subject about how to not be deceived by the angel of Light don't try to force God to
1:08:02
speak that's a big way um and any kind
1:08:08
of Pride if there's if there's a pride and like wanting to seem spiritual or
1:08:13
something towards people uh the angel of Light will tend to speak and give you
1:08:19
Revelations and and things like this um that that's a way that doors are open so
1:08:26
above all humble yourself and be okay with God being simple your relationship
1:08:34
with him being simple and be okay with God coming in a still Small Voice and not in the
1:08:42
earthquake Wind and Fire most of the time be okay with that be okay with
1:08:47
God's way of speaking to you his be okay with his way of hear his way of you
1:08:53
hearing his voice uh uh and and
1:08:59
value treasure the words coming forth from your teacher Your
1:09:05
Leader value them treasure them meditate on them this is important part of being
1:09:11
a kindergartener being a child being childlike being like a child Jesus says
1:09:17
unless you become like a child that's why I say kindergartener I'm trying to bring the scripture to life to you because we've heard the scripture so
1:09:22
many times you must become like a child what does that mean you you feel like you're a senior in high school right now
1:09:28
like go to kindergarten class and be okay with it empty out all that knowledge be okay with going
1:09:35
slow you know so be patient with with the word that I'm
1:09:41
releasing focus on that meditate on that I heard someone asking a question like I
1:09:47
don't understand this this scripture or this book of the Bible Well if I'm not
1:09:53
if I haven't shared that recently you you don't need to worry about that yet that will come later there's so many
1:10:00
books in the Bible there's so much different uh uh knowledge of the kingdom
1:10:06
and you can't receive it all at one time so stay in kindergarten class where the
1:10:13
kindergarten teacher like me for example is releasing what you need to be able to
1:10:19
graduate kindergarten class to go on to First Class rather than going to
1:10:24
kindergarten class class during the day not doing the kindergarten homework by meditating on what was taught and
1:10:31
applying it and rather you are purchasing online fifth grade
1:10:39
textbooks and 10th grade course courses and you're doing that on your
1:10:46
free time rather than doing the kindergarten homework and so imagine if
1:10:51
you're not focused in kindergarten and you're focused on the 10th grade work and the fifth grade work you're not even
1:10:57
going to be able to graduate kindergarten to go to first grade to then second third fourth fifth 6 7th 8th nth 10th and Beyond that's how it's like
1:11:05
in the spiritual realm so stay humble be teachable be like a child
1:11:10
and your your eyes will stay open to have this discernment amen and this is me here
1:11:18
this isn't quite kindergarten class but we need to have in our hearts that we are like babies to receive them milk and
1:11:25
the meat amen can we talk to him sometimes like a
1:11:31
friend of course yes you should be always talking to God as a friend as father as Lord so just having in your
1:11:41
heart that he's your like my I think of my mom my
1:11:46
mom was my band teacher my band director
1:11:51
so she was Mrs crick in the school so I would have respect towards her you
1:11:58
know I wouldn't see her just as Mom in school but Mrs Crick it's just like the
1:12:04
president's uh spouse you know they're going to have respect to also see them as president and not just spouse so with
1:12:13
God it's like that you know you need to have in your heart he is your best
1:12:18
friend but you have way you have respect for your best friend on Earth but
1:12:24
there's like way more respect and reverence for God because he's Lord and
1:12:31
your father so carry that in your heart and talk to him in that
1:12:38
way friend Father and Lord amen
1:12:43
hallelujah thank you Jesus I am going to declare over you all right now and I
1:12:49
know that today in this live God
1:12:55
is freeing you from religion from the ways angel of Light has
1:13:01
come and is freeing you from these carnal ways that have held you back I
1:13:08
see prophetically conviction has come conviction of of evil in heart of
1:13:16
pride in heart of listening to the angel of Light
1:13:22
or you know because you desire what the angel of Light was saying more than
1:13:29
wisdom it's time to be truthful in that area I remember that's when I was that story that I just gave that example from
1:13:36
10 years ago uh or so it's like when I looked back I could see oh there was conviction
1:13:44
wisdom guide Holy Spirit speaking but the the angel of Light
1:13:50
voice that was coming through these signs was what I wanted to follow because remember that desire of my heart
1:13:56
that day was to um I want Direction and I want forward movement for my
1:14:04
career that was what I really wanted and so the angel of Light started speaking
1:14:10
these things that were like what I wanted um and
1:14:16
so you I know God is opening your eyes to this now that some some of you need
1:14:24
