0:01
Jesus said on multiple occasions he only speaks what his father speaks and the
0:06
same with Timothy and Paul is this a spiritual principle yes it's it's this it's going
0:14
along with you have one Shepherd and my sheep
0:21
the Sheep know the shepherd's voice the scripture that talks about the Sheep know the shepherd's voice they shepherd
0:27
and on this Earth You God has given you one Shepherd um some people are on a
0:33
journey to find whom that Shepherd is another word for that Shepherd is
0:39
spiritual father or spiritual mother as Paul was to Timothy as Elijah was to
0:44
Elisha as Moses was to Joshua um and Paul talks about you have many teachers
0:50
but only one father so your one father or mother on this Earth spiritual father
0:55
or spiritual mother is not on accident is not Accord to your preference but is
1:01
whom God chooses for you and that spiritual father or mother is also going to be your
1:06
Shepherd Earthly Shepherd and um so that
1:11
scripture where it talks about how my sheep know my voice so this is speaking
1:18
of of God's voice we know the voice of God and we know when um it's the angel
1:28
of Light well when we grow with wisdom we can discern that we can know when the angel of Light is
1:33
speaking um trying to disguise himself the enemy trying to disguise himself as
1:39
our Our Shepherd in heaven but one of the big ways that God speaks is through people and so one of the big ways that
1:46
your Shepherd in in heaven God is going to be speaking to you is through your Shepherd on Earth um and so uh
1:56
especially in this new wine it's it's it's it's clear once you've Taste of the new wine once your once your eyes have
2:02
opened up to the new wine you can recognize why this is really important because there's so many that are stuck
2:08
in the old wine still that are stuck in religion that haven't had their eyes opened up um totally or only
2:16
partially uh you know there are leaders there are ministers who are stuck in the old wine and haven't had their eyes opened up and so when your eyes aren't
2:25
open up totally you're not going to be able to speak purely the new wine there's a lot of Doctrine and teaching
2:32
that's tainted with old wine sometimes it's a mix of new wine and old wine sometimes it's totally old wine so when
2:40
your eyes have opened up to this new wine you can really see the importance of listening to The Shepherd's voice
2:46
knowing the shepherd's voice and knowing how easy it is to be indoctrinated you
2:53
know how easy it is to get some religion mixed in there old wine
2:58
mixed in there so um especially when it comes to prophetic words for your life spiritual
3:08
direction this should be coming from your Shepherd from your spiritual father
3:14
or mother shouldn't be coming randomly it shouldn't be coming by um fellow
3:20
fellow Believers in the church that's not where that's not your Shepherd
3:25
that's not your Shepherd and you really have to recognize that because that's one of the ways the enemy wants to try
3:32
to come as an angel of Light is is speaking a prophetic direction through a
3:38
fellow believer who's not your Shepherd but it seems harmless it seems like oh this
3:44
sounds good this sounds like a good word this sounds this sounds like God that's
3:50
why the devil masquerades himself as an angel of Light meaning it sounds like it could be God it sounds good it doesn't
3:57
sound demonic at all but it doesn't mean it's God's voice and so that's why it's
4:03
very important you carry this in your heart to only hear the shepherd's
4:08
voice and once you are a disciple a true
4:13
disciple you know look at look at for example look at um Timothy and Paul Paul
4:19
many times is saying I'm sending to you Timothy he's going to share with you my
4:26
words he's going to remind you of my words
4:32
that's powerful um so what's happening right there is Paul is a Shepherd Of
4:37
Timothy and Paul was The Shepherd of many people in his ministry and so
4:43
Timothy was going as a representative um not preaching
4:48
something on his own not coming as a different kind of Shepherd but repeating
4:55
his Shepherd's voice to the other people's same Shepherd they they all had the same Shepherd of Paul as Paul so um
5:03
that's what's really powerful is um to to see that to see that principle you
5:09
see as Timothy is repeating his Shepherd's words what he heard his
5:16
Shepherd his spiritual Father Paul speak that's what he shared and
5:22
repeated amen and this oh and by the way what I share right now is so so so important
5:29
new one Doctrine uh because in the church today
5:34
especially the charismatic church like there's um there's a lot of people like I guess they call them
5:41
charismatic um I'm not as much into the the lingo especially because pretty much
5:48
I mean within one year I came from not knowing um that God moved in power that
5:56
demons existed and could be cast out of people that God used people in the anointing not knowing about Apostles and
6:02
Prophets today I went from that like total old wine to completely new wine in
6:10
one year like I received my spiritual father my Prophet Dr D David became my spiritual
6:16
father and he is certainly a general in the kingdom of God he is as high level
6:24
prophet and high level servant of God As It Gets In terms of the kingdom of God
6:31
government so he was my spiritual father immediately so
6:37
um it it was it was like one extreme to another for me um but so I I didn't I I
6:46
it's like I went from not knowing anything to right in
6:52
the end time Revival army with access glory to God for God's purpose access to
6:59
spiritual meat and deep spiritual truths that so many people don't know
7:06
Hallelujah um but anyways that being said I I I I didn't even know of like
7:12
the Christian culture of I didn't know revivals and the past and history and
7:17
all of that when it came to vessels who walked in the power of God but anyways
7:22
now I've learned a little bit um but that's why I say I don't I don't really say like the charismatics or whatever
7:28
but I know like um many people call like a charismatic movement or that's maybe been around for
7:36
some decades or so like just people who believe in the Holy Spirit and the power of God and healing and deliverance and
7:42
baptism of holy spirit so anyways the uh you know Believers in this I don't know
7:49
if you want whatever denomination we can say there's there's like what God is
7:54
bringing in this area denomination uh belief Group whatever we want to call
8:01
it God is bringing new wine he's opening up eyes there's something new that he has brought once
8:08
he once he brought the Revival once he like in very recent years once he has
8:13
brought Revival he has brought new wine Revelation that wasn't there
8:19
yet so um so so like for example one of the new
8:26
wine Revelation doctrines true truths is this
8:31
revelation of authority how Authority and Order operates order and Authority
8:37
in the kingdom of God translating in the church and in
8:42
Ministry um and one of one aspect of this is like how we cast out demons that
8:50
it's not chaotic that it's not a freefor all and everybody just screaming loud at
8:55
one time um and just doing whatever they feel to try to cast demons out of people
9:02
everywhere in the church no instead we do it the biblical way of the new wine biblical way of the
9:09
Apostle Peter way and Apostle Paul way and Jesus way like but for example Apostle Peter where it was one person
9:17
casting demons out of people at one time um everyone who came under his shadow
9:23
they were all healed and delivered the Bible said all um and so what he was doing was he was walking proper in
9:30
authority and in order um and that is a key of why he was
9:36
so effective of why so many demons had to go and had to
9:43
obey is because really he was operating in Authority in how it's supposed to be
9:50
with the new wine Revelation so you have what you do what you have is in the
9:55
times we're living in is like partial Revelation like some some people eyes are opened up partially where they
10:01
believe in casting out of demons you know but maybe they don't know really the true right way of how to cast out
10:08
demons of what makes demons go you have this mix going on in the body of Christ
10:14
right now when it comes to those who are open to the movement of the Holy Spirit and this this way of order and Authority
10:22
also applies to prophecy so um it's the same thing it's not supposed to be everybody prophesying
10:29
in in the church everywhere in the church um but it's
10:35
supposed to be that same way of order and Authority um otherwise there will be
10:42
confusion where there's not order and when we go outside the the
10:48
principle of authority there'll be chaos so um it's so important
10:56
because we are all called to prophesy but so so much of us so many people are
11:03
actually not called to prophesy as prophets prophesying Direction over
11:09
someone's life you are called to this ministry you got to be so careful even to say I see
11:15
you called to Ministry you got to be so careful I mean the this is these are Big directional prophecies you're speaking
11:22
when you start saying stuff like this got to be really careful to know um
11:30
how delicate this is how delicate this is when people are eager and ready to
11:36
run with the word of God you know you don't I
11:42
mean you you can't play with that you can't play with that it's better to just
11:47
edify and encourage it's better to say I see the light of Jesus in you and he is
11:54
using you powerfully he going to use you powerfully you have a great
12:00
calling in your life edify encourage prophetically speak but in in in the
12:05
area of encouragement of edification but not
12:11
directional if you are not a prophet or called or an apostle or called in this
12:19
place of Shepherd a Shepherd in this person's life or anointed for
12:25
this because when we when we go when we're in order is where we remain safe
12:31
is where is where we are safe so when we go outside of God's order we're not safe
12:37
we're we're opening up doors to the angel of Light someone can be um someone
12:43
can be so antsy to feel purpose in their life this is common for a lot of people
12:50
they can feel just bored with life
12:55
and annoyed that dreams haven't come to pass yet and just all of a sudden this huge
13:02
hunger for feeling purposeful and important and
13:08
looking important that to come in their life and next thing you know it enemy knows this
13:13
and he starts sending temptations that sound Godly you should start your own
13:19
Ministry and that's not God's will for one's life or that or maybe it is but not until five years 10 years from
13:27
now um and next thing you know somebody's
13:32
operating outside of order and starts prophesying to somebody the angel of
13:38
Light gave them this strong inkling devil M himself as a angel of Light gave them this strong in
13:44
inkling this person is called to to Ministry to to be a prophet or be an
13:52
apostle prophesy this to them and then they speak that out of order and the
13:58
person runs with it and they run outside of God's Will and they leave where they're
14:05
planted and they focus on themselves and they they claim it's God
14:12
speaking but it's not you know this is why I say it's it's so
14:18
dangerous um but this is one of those like uh old wine doctrines that's mixed
14:25
in a lot of the body of Christ right now of everybody prophesies to everybody um prophecy should be for everybody
14:33
should be in the area of edifying and encouraging not prophesying as Prophets
14:40
The Office of prophets directional things very important so this is so
14:48
important for you all to know for yourself as you
14:54
prophesy but as you speak prophetically to to know how to walk that in wisdom
14:59
but but so much so for yourself of knowing what to receive and what to not receive you're going to notice a lot of
15:05
people going out of order because with with Revival comes so much excitement
15:11
and I mean z Zeal and with Revival comes babies that aren't mature yet that have
15:18
to learn that that haven't that just came excitedly to the Revival and then they start doing things their old way so
15:26
you really have to be prepared and be aware of what's going on in the
15:33
spiritual realm so you don't just um receive things receive things just
15:40
because they sound good receive prophecies prophecies just because they sound pleasing to you so that's one of
15:46
the big areas by the way to circle around back to that question about only speaking what the shepherd speaks
15:53
um knowing your Shepherd you got to not just be receiving prophecy and teaching
16:01
from anywhere even from fellow Believers in the church where you're planted right
16:07
because that can happen this is one of the the ways the enemy can
16:13
work coming as an there there's always people there's always going to be susceptibility to the angel of Light
16:18
Within a church because you not everybody's we're not robots we have free will and everybody's at different
16:24
maturity levels and sometimes somebody's in a season where the enemy is really comeing strategically attacking them to
16:31
try to come in this angel of Light way to try to pull people away so it's not
16:37
something to be like afraid about or like be like who can I trust and be afraid like not to live like that but
16:43
like just having that it's just just simply having that awareness um once you start to see funky
16:49
things happening out of order things happening just have this awareness oh yes like the enemy wants to try to come
16:55
as an angel of Light but I know better I know I know my shepherd's voice that's
17:01
it that's all you have to think about if a friend from 5f calls you with
17:07
a oops I I got to scroll back to find the question a friend from five off causi with a really urgent okay and so
17:14
this is all who are planted at 5f church but at there may be people will be there will be people watching this that are
17:19
planted other places or maybe they aren't planted so we'll just say if a friend from 5f church or um whatever
17:24
Church you were planted at they call you with a really urgent and bad situation is it out of order to pray over them if
17:31
they're planted already so um this is this is a good
17:37
question in the area of order this is a very good question and it's definitely new wine what I'm going to share like
17:43
it's it's really not the old way of doing things so and and the big thing is
17:49
the anointing the big reason why this is so new is that the anointing has been so rare and once the anointing is present
17:55
this is what makes things so different because people are not used to having the power of God available and accessible to them and so once the power
18:02
of God is available and accessible to you you need to make sure you're you're uh you know how to access it you know
18:09
how you you know how to go in the right order to really access that anointing amen okay so
18:16
um so H what it so when you are planted
18:21
at a church where God's power isn't where there's really anointing that anointing is there for
18:27
you when you consider yourself planted there there's a covering over you so it means that you can always call upon God
18:34
where you are planted and he will hear you he will release miracles to you 100%
18:41
this will happen um the big thing is for you to have faith in that power of God
18:47
you know the Apostle Peter it says whenever they position themselves under the shadow of the
18:52
anointing all were healed and delivered specifically in Apostle Peter's Shadow he was carrying High high level
18:59
anointing and so don't disvalue that high level anointing sometimes you really need that most highest level
19:05
anointing and it's moves with such ease over you if you'll just simply position yourself like just simply getting under
19:10
the waterfall you're for sure going to be drenched it's like that principle so really um whenever there's a situation
19:18
that comes up in one's own life uh like an emergency situation or just a
19:24
a situation where you need you urgently desperately need a man
19:29
Miracle what we what you should do is literally run under the waterfall of
19:35
anointing position yourself under that anointing um so come to church in person
19:42
if you can come to a live stream that's how it count that's that's considered
19:47
positioning yourself under the anointing watch a replay um doing all those things that
19:53
anointing is coming upon you and the things that are declared are going to come upon your life
19:59
when when um you when you position yourself Hallelujah um
20:06
so um
20:11
it's when you know how to Value the anointing that's how you don't miss out at all when you know when you have faith
20:19
in that in God's true power that's how you can receive it all so when people
20:25
kind of like forget what they have access to when they forget that that waterfall is right there and
20:33
they need to get under it when they forget that they can miss out so that's the most important thing in terms of
20:40
like making sure you can receive everything you need is is really valuing
20:45
the anointing um so how do you value the
20:51
anointing well like when a situation arises where you need a
20:57
miracle you need help from God you renew your mind and you don't fear but you you
21:06
you believe you know you you believe the woman with issue of blood if I just
21:11
Touch the Hem of Jesus's robe I know I will be healed that kind of faith I know the power of God where I am
21:19
planted I've seen all kinds of Miracles I believe in this power of God I am
21:25
planted here and so any miracle I need I know God will release it to me as I'm
21:31
going in or in I'm as I'm in line with God's order and
21:37
principles so God I I I I you can declare the Miracles you need I declare
21:43
these doors op open of provision I thank you Lord that if it's provision you need
21:50
I thank you Lord for this anointing this power of God that is moving and releasing this provision in my life I
21:57
thank you Lord to pray prayers like this and position yourself in person online a
22:05
replay I'm here ready to receive fresh anointing right now that I need for my life even if I've seen this video in the
22:12
past but this time I'm going to receive something fresh as the word is declared
22:18
um you know when I was watching this video in the past I didn't need that thing that was declared maybe I didn't need the provision for example or I
22:23
didn't need the healing but I need it now and so I'm receiving this word fresh as if God speaking it right now amen
22:32
hallelujah um and so that's a big way to Value another way
22:38
to value is under like understanding and being
22:44
obedient to do the things to receive the anointing so receiving the anointing comes by positioning yourself watching
22:52
coming in person as I just shared and also sewing because what you sew you will reap the Bible says
22:59
this is one of the ways that we receive so the Bible says um it says test me in this bring the
23:06
tithe into the storehouse into the church the work of God and see that I won't pour out so many blessings that
23:12
you won't have any room for all the blessings so this is a challenge God
23:18
literally says test me bring offering to my Ministry to this work of God where
23:24
you are planted and when you do that I will pour out so many blessings upon you
23:30
and the thing is like these blessings aren't like random blessings they aren't like okay when you tithe you get
23:36
lollipops you know when you when you show up to um Church you get meat and
23:43
vegetables but when you tithe you get lollipops doesn't work that way it's
23:48
like God knows all the things that you need all of the Miracles all of the
23:53
different aspects of your inheritance in Christ that you haven't received yet Deliverance healing
24:00
um so he has all of these things that you need he has he has the
24:07
things the Miracles that you need to get you out of the deficit in his hands and
24:14
he also has more blessings more blessings
24:20
because John 1010 I Came To Give You Abundant Life so even more blessings
24:26
like you just wanted to be able to pay your bills that's all you wanted but God wanted to give you more so you could be
24:31
a blessing for others and also so you could be an example of what following Jesus looks like Abundant Life in every
24:38
area Hallelujah so this is what God has in his hands and he has ways of releasing
24:44
it and his main ways of releasing it is through his vessels where you're planted his anointing moving and and and so it
24:51
comes as you position yourself number one just watch come in person and they
24:57
just come to you Hallelujah they're released to you and then another big way
25:02
it comes um is by sewing and so all of these different
25:09
blessings it's not like okay this blessing only comes when you sew only the lollipops only the only the
25:15
financial blessings come when you SE it's it's not it's it's whatever God
25:20
chooses whatever God chooses and so that's why it's so important we are surrendered we're not like well I I
25:28
prefer to just receive by coming and watching online and not by sewing so I'm
25:34
okay with missing out on those blessings because I don't feel like sewing it
25:39
doesn't work that way it's not like you're just missing out on the lollipops like you're missing out on things that
25:45
you really need that God specifically chose to release to you in this venue in
25:51
this way so it's really simple surrender to God's principles serving is another
25:57
way we receive that's specifically so much how we receive anointing I mean anointing of impartation but it it's
26:05
serving is a part of just being in the will of God and contributing to the work
26:10
of God and sewing so you reap so positioning yourself um by watching sewing serving
26:20
these are ways these are ways to receive amen so um th those those those are the
26:28
big ways to receive so so so that's important for you to understand when you're in need make sure you're doing
26:34
all these things and sometimes God will be calling you to do more in some area like um to sew believing for something
26:43
for god making a sacrifice so even though you've been sewing but to sew to make more of a sacrifice that's God's
26:50
will sometimes how God wants to release to you more um and
26:56
so when a friend comes you know with you know needing a miracle it's
27:05
it's important to stay in the new wine and not go back to the old wine way or back to what makes that person feel good
27:12
this is really important especially like right after church ends because when church ends sometimes people are so much
27:18
in the old wine mindset of I need one-on-one prayer um and they they they they they
27:25
they are not wanting to accept God's ways because sometimes God's ways are
27:32
that he he he doesn't release the miracle through one one one-onone prayer he releases it by his anointing moving
27:39
through a vessel as they release it as they declare the word and it comes to you where you are not through a
27:44
one-on-one prayer just where you're at as as the Jesus did to the Centurion solders servant spoke the word that's
27:52
God's way of really of receiving the miracle but some and so sometime many times people have received the miracle
27:58
already they haven't seen the manifestation yet but it's there and if they would just believe they will start to see a manifest later later in the day
28:06
tomorrow the next day or whenever a week later whenever but it's already happened
28:11
it's already begun in the spiritual realm But like after church a lot of people are just stuck in the old wine
28:17
way sometimes or sometimes they're being stubborn you know sometimes um they just
28:24
don't want to accept God's ways like no I just want one-onone prayer pray I want one1 prayer to make sure it's going to
28:30
work you know um and so it's so important that we don't like Bend to
28:37
what people want but we stay obedient so we we
28:43
obedient to be pleasing God and not pleasing people this is one of the ways that we can be pleasing people um is by
28:51
doing things the old wine way the way they want it's praying for them how they want to be prayed for and everything you
28:56
know so what do you the proper thing to do like if it was right after church for example and someone is distraught
29:02
because they just really want a one-one prayer I'm telling you like you know how
29:08
all were healed and delivered under Apostle Peter's Shadow I'm telling you I have no doubt in my mind that that could
29:14
be happening every single Sunday every single live stream I know the power of the anointing that God has released here
29:21
in this end time Revival I know the power of this anointing there's no doubt in my mind that everybody could be
29:28
healed and delivered and so this is God's way it's released now it's up to the
29:34
people to receive it's up to them but it's been done the words have been
29:40
declared the anointing has been released to everybody there doesn't need to be another one-on-one prayer that would be
29:47
going outside of God's ways outside of God's order it would be being
29:53
disrespectful to God's ways and God's order and disv valuing the anointing that has been
29:59
released so it's like this anointing has been released it's in the air and it's everything you need it's the Miracles
30:05
you need and it's just like it's like you're just like I don't care no I I want a one-on-one prayer you know it's
30:12
dis valuing God it's is valuing God's ways it's is valuing God's
30:17
power so um so it's so important for you
30:23
all to realize that if you're at church on Sunday for example or a Revival event or flourish conference the the proper
30:31
order proper thing to do if someone is like
30:36
um you know really wanting more prayer wanting a one-on-one prayer they didn't receive one-on-one prayer maybe or maybe
30:43
they did receive one-onone prayer but they didn't feel anything so they think I need more prayer until I feel
30:49
something when I feel something then I know I've received the miracle no because many times God does the Miracles
30:54
without physical feelings or manifestations we just have to believe and see it manifest so when these things
31:00
happen the way to be in the right order is to to encourage speaking the truth
31:08
reminding reminding usually God will Le me to share kind of a summary of what I
31:14
just shared to help people know how to receive um so sometimes it's just
31:20
reminding what reminding what has just been released the words have just been released um remember it's not about a
31:26
feeling I know the power power of this anointing you can encourage someone I know the power of this anointing myself
31:32
I've received so many miracles and I didn't even realize it at the time because I didn't feel anything but then later I saw change or if that wasn't you
31:40
maybe you did always have a physical manifestation but you've heard so many test monies of other people who didn't receive who didn't have physical
31:47
manifestations but they were healed and they were delivered encourage them of that and just encourage them and say you
31:53
have received don't let the enemy lie to you right now declare I received those
31:59
words that were declared there was a word that was declared that said be healed every disease must go every pain
32:05
must go I receive this word say speak it right now say I receive that word I
32:10
receive that word in that anointing that wased upon me that I am
32:15
healed or that addiction must go or every demonic Spirit must go or every Spirit attached to what I rounce I
32:22
renounce these things the word cannot return to void I receive that word
32:28
that everything that I renounced must go from me I receive that word and I
32:34
believe I am free thank you Jesus for freeing me encourage them to speak like this to speak positive words of
32:40
confession that's how they it's like it's like the anointing and miracles are like in the air and people can choose to
32:47
grab them and leave with them or not and so when the service ends God has great
32:53
grace the anointing still there the power is still there and so it's your job of someone's struggling it's your
33:00
job you know like thinking they're not healed or delivered it's your job to
33:05
help them grab the miracle and anointings that's in the air with them
33:11
by encouraging them and reminding them amen um so also you can you can
33:19
also say this word that was declared over you right now this word that was
33:26
just declared you can say the word that Apostle Katherine just declared that must come to pass in your life you can
33:34
declare in that way but it's not to start do a new
33:40
declaration that's how we stay in order and how we help people really receive
33:47
and maintain what they've received and your words are powerful so um if a person calls you like really
33:55
like wanting prayer you know you can just speak Words of Life over them and it's doing
34:03
powerful things in the spiritual realm it's because what they're needing is faith faith in the power of God that's
34:10
already accessible to them so remind them just remind them of the truth and
34:16
speak and declare these words of truth rather than coming like in your own authority to speak
34:24
something new when you do that when you use your Authority and declare thing
34:30
like declare demons to go sickness to go like this this would be for
34:38
people that are not planted at the church you're planted in but are in your
34:44
workplace are are are people you meet on in transportation when you're doing your
34:50
errands are sometimes it could be your family uh depending if they're they're
34:57
PL you know they're planted or not and everything this is where it's your your
35:03
place of authority this is where you're called to go out and be a representative you're
35:09
you're called to go out and be doing like what your spiritual father or
35:15
mother is doing in your own territory and leading them to where you're
35:21
receiving from so here's a question um that a
35:26
spouse has received freedom in some areas but still on a journey to surrender everything um
35:32
so any advice so basically the question is like when one when you are
35:39
surrendered completely but your spouse is not surrendered completely um
35:46
so this is the thing we are we are all on different Journeys we are all on
35:52
different Journeys and it's going to look it's going to look different for everyone like when the when the the
35:58
growth the spiritual growth like some people some people they can come to
36:04
um a place where God's power is fivefold church for example they can come and
36:10
they can grow so fast they can go from a baby to being mature very fast another
36:19
person who has a beautiful heart um it's not that they don't have a
36:27
good heart but it's it's slower it's slower
36:33
going we all have free will and we all have different kinds of um different
36:40
kinds of battles different seasons um I shared about this like um
36:50
at the Q&A session in New York City someone asked is everyone
36:55
tempted and um I was really meditating so much about my own personal life and I was just
37:01
thinking like if my parents were different than how they were I wouldn't have such an inclination
37:08
towards Purity I wouldn't have it's like my my back my parents really instilled
37:16
Purity in me and humility and they just showed me the Bible says train train
37:21
your children up in the right way and even when they're older they won't depart from it and it's really true so
37:27
they really sewed into me like just this is the right way this is the right way
37:33
so I I never heard them gossip I never heard them really complain even um I
37:39
never heard them judge people so that so like that was just putting me it was just putting me this is the right way
37:44
this is the right way this is the right way this is the right way and so even in my season of at lukewarm that I lived in
37:53
man it was so strong what my parents didn't I look back and I see what my parents didn't still to me was so strong
37:59
that it it was like an anchor where the temptation to really go like fully in
38:06
lukewarm life like really far into lukewarm or away from
38:11
God there what they had instilled was such a strong anchor
38:17
where I had that benefit I had that on my side and that had nothing to do with
38:22
anything I did that had to do with God's grace in my life and what my parents did for me so there was like this privilege
38:28
that I had and so like my ability to
38:35
surrender my ability to obey God the way my heart is like the way my heart is
38:43
pure and like all that like
38:48
I I don't think highly of myself I I
38:53
don't I don't really think like wow look how great I am and better I am than
39:01
other people because it's just not true like because I I know the truth I know
39:07
that it's God's grace it's thanks to my parents
39:14
obedience and so like my ability to surrender and the status of my heart of
39:22
like of like being pure and the being able to be OB obedient I know that a lot
39:29
of it's like me my decision but deep down I I I don't I don't see it as as
39:36
much me as God's grace you know I you know what I mean
39:41
like it's I just see that it's God's grace I just see so strongly that if if
39:49
things were different if my parents weren't the way they were um for example
39:54
if I want to be this way you know if my parents' Hearts weren't
40:02
pure I think it would be a bigger struggle for my heart to be pure at least right away God Can Transform
40:09
anybody no matter what their past is so that I believe would happen but I think it would probably take longer at least
40:15
you know so all that to say we all have different
40:22
Temptations of the enemy you know I be I
40:27
truly believe because of thanks to my parents I truly believe that I have not
40:34
gone through um uh as deep Temptations as other people have there wasn't this
40:41
grip of generational curses and everything from the enemy so strong in my life that I simply didn't have to
40:47
endure that like strong Temptations as other people's as other people do um I
40:54
don't know what it's like to be controlled by by the enemy like so many people feel that way in the area of
41:02
drugs and sleeping with people sleeping around and stuff
41:08
um and so all that being said this is what's going on this is
41:15
what's behind why some people surrender quicker than others um so much of it is
41:21
having to do with the past and the the
41:26
history of um like the way the enemy had a hold on someone's life so someone can be free
41:35
but it's like the enemy may try harder
41:42
to get them to not move forward because he had such a hold on them before it
41:47
doesn't mean that that person doesn't have just as much chance to have complete Victory as somebody else that
41:54
the enemy didn't have such a hold on their life in the past I'm not saying that it's just um in certain Seasons it
42:01
may be more of a war in that person's life where another person they're like easily surrendered to God easily
42:07
following God also you know we we all have different encounters with God at different
42:13
times like God just chose to reveal himself to
42:19
me through his power for the first time in my mid 20s but in my Ministry I'm seeing like
42:27
young children encounter Jesus in power at like 3 years old four years old
42:35
five years old so different right so and I just think like some of these children
42:42
that I see I'm like wow like if I was in their shoes I I I feel like I probably
42:48
wouldn't have gone through a lukewarm stage at all if I could have encountered the power of God at their age you know
42:53
so just keeping that in mind um to give you patience keeping that in mind to
43:00
give you patience and that it's not a matter of like logic
43:05
or what can I do it's mostly patience um
43:12
and it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance so if there's a spouse if there's a family member that is not
43:18
surrendered fully and you are surrendered and this is burden in your heart and you want to see them fully
43:23
surrendered you can do something and that is is be kind be loving love with the love of
43:31
Christ and this will be a big way that they experiencing the kindness of God
43:37
the only thing that leads to repentance repentance the Bible says the kindness of God leads to repentance that's the
43:43
only thing that brings repentance so it's very simple what can you do be kind
43:49
be the most Christlike you can be there are huge things happening when you're doing that when you're doing that they
43:55
are they experiencing the kindness of God through you the love of God through you it's no small
44:02
thing trust God trust God in his perfect timing the Harvest will come there isn't
44:07
it's not like on August 9th everyone becomes surrendered to God we all have
44:14
different timelines of when we became saved when we gave everything to Jesus
44:19
it's not a certain age that all of a sudden everybody becomes saved it's it's
44:25
all different what do if a miracle isn't happening after one year of Declaration
44:30
every day so if you are in need of a miracle if you're need in need you know first of
44:38
all John 10:10 the devil came to steal kill and destroy but I have come that you would have Abundant Life this is
44:43
100% God's will for you to have Abundant Life um but
44:48
like there's some things that sometimes we need to realize first
44:55
of all what Abundant Life is um like true Abundant Life is peace joy
45:03
sound mind healing Freedom
45:08
provision but the first part of Abundant Life is is is having
45:15
provision just enough to live and then in God's perfect will and
45:22
timing more abundance comes in the area of provision for example you know like for me God
45:31
specifically took me through a time where um I I I had just enough
45:38
financially well I was needing to ask my parents for help I was having just enough for years but it wasn't that I
45:46
wasn't like doing something it wasn't that God was just holding back a
45:53
miracle I was living in in abundance and the area of I had provision um and in
46:01
God's timing the more came the mo the the the
46:06
the the like more of the promise came so I was in the beginning of the promise but more
46:13
of it came so you first have to understand that that sometimes it's just about God's timing um he might be purposefully
46:20
keeping you someplace um in a season of stretching
46:25
for the purpose of refining in you he he works all things out for good all he uses all things so
46:34
um but the other thing is is is is that
46:40
sometimes the miracle comes not in the timing we want but it's
46:48
still there and this is we have to make sure we're doing
46:54
everything that God is calling us to do following his principles um if you if
47:00
you found it's been a long time and you still need a miracle I would advise um going to my playlist how to receive and
47:06
maintain complete deliverance five-part message so make sure that you are doing
47:13
everything you're supposed to be doing um to access this miracle and then also
47:19
to maintain this miracle and um make sure you're really
47:25
meditating on that if you're really seeing I'm not seeing this miracle come really keep watching maybe there's
47:30
something that you haven't really fully received yet your ears haven't opened up yet and be humble to see that you're
47:38
really applying these instructions these words as well and um if there have been personal
47:45
instructions given make sure you're applying them and you're continuing to apply them and um if all if you're
47:54
really where the anointing is that's what's important because it's the anointing that destroys the Yol so I'm speaking this concerning if you were planted where the anointing is that's
48:01
the biggest thing so if you've done all these things now it's your job to just
48:07
rest and believe because sometimes um God is using this to test your obedience
48:14
your humility and um your faith your
48:20
obedience your humility and your faith so sometimes like we we got to make sure
48:26
we're not feeling entitled to a miracle it's like there's like two parts to it on one hand we need to have faith this
48:32
is my inheritance but at the same time if you're doing everything that God has
48:38
called you to do to receive to access the anointing to receive this miracle
48:44
this inheritance um you got to humble yourself and not feel entitled you got
48:49
to humble yourself and know it is coming it is here I'm going to see it Manifest this is my inheritance I
48:56
believe God I trust God I don't question him I don't question his servants who
49:03
have shared this instruction you know um but I humble
49:10
myself that this inheritance from God it may
49:16
manifest later just like the people with Leprosy the people with Leprosy could have come to Jesus could have left
49:21
Jesus's presence and been like where is my Miracle they already received it the the Bible says on their way to the
49:28
priests when after Jesus said show yourselves to the priests on their way they were healed so that means that it wasn't immediately
49:35
they were in Jesus's presence and they didn't receive their miracle and so that's very similar to to to coming to
49:41
church where God's power is and seeing all these miracles happen see all these people testifying but yet you don't see
49:48
the miracle in your life yet that's like a how it would have been for the people with Leprosy because so many people were
49:53
receiving immediate miracles in Jesus's presence so those leprees could have felt that way when they left Jesus's
49:58
presence where was my Miracle why didn't I get the miracle you did get the miracle but God is just choosing to make
50:06
it to manifest later for you as you walk in obedience and faith and
50:13
humility and um there's many stories in the Bible where um there's a direction
50:19
either by Jesus or different prophets and Servants of God do this seven times dip yourself in the pool seven times and
50:24
on the seven time you'll be healed why not the first time why not the second time so it's the same that's the same principle
50:31
of other people are receiving their Miracle the same night as the the church
50:37
service the flourish conference the Revival event or they're receiving it the next day or they're reing it two
50:42
days later but it's been weeks it's been months it's been a it's been much longer I'm not seeing it yet it's the same
50:49
Principle as in the Bible Why seven times why not one time or two times or three times but seven times why what's
50:56
the point the point is God has a purpose and he's he's using this to to test your
51:03
obedience your faith and your humility just like how the finances for
51:08
me that was an area that God was purposely holding back on releasing the full manifestation
51:15
years later to to as a way to test me and refine
51:21
me so Elisha Elisha sent his servant to
51:26
look for it was a there was a drought and he the prophet said I see
51:32
rain coming so he sent his servant go look for a cloud I see rain coming
51:38
there's going to be a cloud that's going to have the rain that's going to come from it go look for it saying it with all excitement making the servant look
51:45
like he's going to see it the first time he goes to look for it right away but what happens is he goes to look for it
51:51
and there's nothing he comes back he says to the servant to Elisha I mean I
51:56
don't see anything he says go back and look again and this happen seven times he
52:02
says go seven times and on the seventh time he saw very tiny Cloud very tiny Cloud the size of the palm of the hand
52:09
very tiny and then the rain came so was it
52:15
Elisha that was off was he supposed to wait and say wait
52:21
for a few days and then go look no
52:27
this was what God wanted so this was having to do with this plan that God had
52:33
to test this servant in the area of Faith obedience and humility so this same
52:42
principle is true today sometimes the Miracles haven't happened yet because
52:48
God's doing the same thing he did in the Bible with the seven times dip yourself or go keep looking for the cloud you
52:53
don't see it keep looking keep looking so you really need to have faith I
52:59
believe in this power of God I believe in the word of God that says Abundant Life is my inheritance is my portion
53:05
healing is my portion um and humble yourself to make sure
53:10
you're doing everything that's been instructed the the the the teachings for example how to
53:16
receive complete healing and deliverance um humble yourself because sometimes
53:23
maybe you're not be taking them seriously enough and that's the reason so make sure you're humbling yourself
53:29
and really applying them um and uh and after that if you if you
53:36
if you've humbled yourself and you're being such a disciple and applying all the words if you're not seeing it yet
53:41
you just rest just keep looking just keep being expectant and rest no it is
53:47
coming it is coming the cloud is coming and make sure you're closing all the
53:53
doors closing all the doors is it okay to show kindness to family members but not have a relationship with them
53:59
because they are not where you are spiritually yes because you're first of all your true family is in Christ that's
54:07
your true your your truest family and
54:12
um we see many times Jesus says to leave leave your family he says to his
54:17
disciples leave your family Elijah when he called Elisha he had to leave his family he didn't bring his family with
54:24
him but then other disciples we see a brother coming and serving
54:29
alongside it's up to the family members if they want to run the race with you
54:34
but they got to keep up it's up to your family members if they will be Disciples
54:40
of Jesus and then they can be like the the the um sons of thunder they are
54:47
called Brothers of Thunder uh they're Brothers serving God together they're
54:52
biological Brothers serving God together um but so many examples you're seeing um
54:59
the disciples leaving their family it doesn't mean they're like cutting them off not talking to them but it means
55:05
like their life is Christ their life is
55:10
Christ so Christ and what God he's called him to do is
55:17
priority and that means your time is Christ's belongs to
55:23
Christ's not your time belongs to tradition family traditions traditions of spending
55:32
time and everything you know belongs 100% to
55:39
Christ so God calls us to make sacrifice
55:44
there's only so many hours in the day and also we got to make sure that we
55:51
are not intaking negative words that are pulling us back
55:57
so in those situations we're not called to have closer relationships with people that are not equally yolked because
56:04
they're speaking words of death because they're speaking negative words words are spirits they have real power so they
56:10
could be really holding you back from serving God so um even
56:17
Jesus um you know his family was concerned his brother his mother they
56:23
were concerned like so many Pharisees were coming against him and so it was concerning they were concerned for his safety so they're coming to talk to him
56:30
and he's in the middle of ministering and the disciples are saying hey your mother your your brother is here to see
56:35
you and all of a sudden he says my true family are those who follow me and do
56:42
the will of my father and really it was like saying in
56:47
that moment they were like they had the concerns of man they had the concerns of Jesus's like physical safety when like
56:56
for Jesus to be taken in that place and taken away from that work and be like
57:02
yes maybe this isn't safe physically um I'm going to listen to you
57:07
guys and take a break from Ministry like that would have been detrimental that would have been stepping outside of
57:12
God's will um so that's why he says that when he says when he when he said that
57:18
that's the context um so he specif he seriously says my true family are are those who do
57:27
the will of my father so that's how it is for us our truest family the ones
57:34
that we are called to have really close relationships with are those who will do
57:39
the will of our father and sometimes that's our biological family sometimes that's one member only of our biological
57:46
family sometimes that's none of our biological family um but we have to follow Jesus's example and the disciples
57:54
example and the example of Elisha following
58:00
Elijah so um what you do with family whom you
58:06
aren't called to be in close relationship with is that you're called to be the light um but have boundaries
58:12
and to show your light to them um but sometimes showing your light can sometimes just when you do interact you
58:19
are showing the love of God you are kind and um gentle um not forceful not
58:25
pushing um like your testimony on them or something but you're just kind and a big
58:31
way that will you'll Shine Your Light um to the family who who isn't equally
58:37
yolked and is is just by your example even on on social media for example we
58:42
have a great platform all of us to shine our light just like with the videos we're sharing the posts we're sharing of
58:49
what God's doing in the Revival and just how you're living your life living your life shining the Light of Christ that's
58:56
a big way that that that you're planting seeds that that you're really being a
59:01
vessel of God and showing love to people it's not so much you know one-on-one communication but you are showing the
59:07
love of Christ to people and by shining your light when and how do you know when you should pray for someone to receive
59:12
healing or Deliverance I answered this in depth at the New York City Q&A session which is um has been streamed
59:20
live so you can find like a longer answer to that um more in
59:27
depth on that on my YouTube channel but um just give you a short answer because
59:35
of time if it's in your own dominion first of all so let's just give an
59:41
example um maybe it's after work it's after work
59:47
and you're talking with a cooworker and what will happen is when you show
59:53
the love of Christ to someone they're really experiencing God's love through you and it will have an effect it's
1:00:00
planting seeds that will one day turn into a harvest if that's their Free Will which
1:00:05
for most people it will if they're really experiencing God's love because he's irresistible amen um and so the
1:00:11
Harvest will look like a softened heart and being open to God being
1:00:17
curious so when you do show the love of God to somebody sometimes they'll open up
1:00:25
sometimes they'll recognize your light and ask you about your light because they want what you have they don't have
1:00:30
peace Joy like you obviously do and they ask and that leads to sharing your
1:00:37
testimony um it leads to sharing about deliverance and healing that God's brought you and sometimes a person will
1:00:47
desire the healing and freedom that you're sharing about and whether they say they want
1:00:55
this they want freedom like you have can you pray for me or whether you being led
1:01:00
by the Holy Spirit see that they are opening up and see that it's Holy Spirit leading to ask
1:01:06
them would you like me to pray for you I I know God wants this for you too he
1:01:12
wants you to be free of of anxiety of depression for example so um and they say yes then that
1:01:19
would be time to execute your Authority and your Dominion this is your Dominion your territory so your your Dominion
1:01:26
your territory is not going to be at church that's not your Dominion um that's the leader of the church that's
1:01:32
their Dominion like Apostle Peter where people came under his shadow that was his Dominion so I'm giving an example of
1:01:38
like the workplace as being your Dominion um and so you can pray for them
1:01:45
now it won't it might not always be like oh a person wants deliverance and you have to pray
1:01:52
for them it really needs to be led by the Holy Spirit I mean it could be someone have could have a really strong
1:01:59
demonic bondage that you discern maybe they just share with you that they've done tons of Witchcraft when a person
1:02:06
has done tons of Witchcraft for example and also if they have deep generational curses it's like the devil has a deep
1:02:13
hold on them and there's higher level demons there and that requires higher
1:02:18
level anointing um higher level anointing like we see in Apostle Paul acts 1911 God did
1:02:24
extraordinary miracles extraord ordinary there's also extraordinary kind of anointing and Authority in Peter so
1:02:31
sometimes it doesn't always it's not always like someone's open for prayer you need to pray for them it's doesn't
1:02:37
always mean that sometimes you may discern this is beyond my level of
1:02:42
anointing and Authority so the best thing to do is to invite them to church invite them to watch online and this is
1:02:48
what you should be doing anyways if you do pray regardless if you pray for the person or not so that they can receive
1:02:55
um equipping to maintain their Deliverance they've just received so that they can also receive higher level
1:03:01
anointing if they need more deliverance and healing and also because it's God's principle for everyone to be planted
1:03:09
somewhere and if you are planted one place your job is to build not scatter
1:03:14
your job is to build your job is to lead people because when you're your planted really where God's houses and so you're
1:03:20
called to multiply you're called to birth sheep sheep birth sheep so you're called
1:03:26
to bring them into the church where you've received um so that they can be
1:03:32
equipped discipled and receive impartation of anointing and equipping
1:03:37
so that they can fulfill their purpose and be a powerful vessel of God too thank you Lord I declare right
1:03:45
now that whatever Miracle you need healing
1:03:51
Deliverance breakthrough I send this anointing to you now that you would receive
1:03:58
it pain in the body it must go healing in your physical body I release it to
1:04:04
you in Jesus name be healed and any way the enemy is trying
1:04:10
to pull you back stifle your fire I declare that must be removed in Jesus
1:04:17
name I declare this anointing to come upon you and that this fire would grow
1:04:25
in you that boldness would grow that Joy would increase that peace would increase I
1:04:33
release the joy of the Lord and your spiritual eyes to open up to see his
1:04:39
goodness and his love and his faithfulness the more our eyes are
1:04:46
opened up to and the more we remember his goodness his faithfulness
1:04:53
his love blessings he's given us the more joy we will walk in that's how we
1:05:00
that's the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is seeing remembering and
1:05:08
valuing the truth of who God is and what he's done for you so let everything that's tried
1:05:17
to like pile up like you know like clothes piling up covering things in
1:05:24
your room you know like a dirty room any way the devil's like tried to pile
1:05:29
things on in your life pile thing pile things up blocking your understanding your
1:05:36
spiritual eyesight it must be removed now let it be cleaned now in Jesus
1:05:44
name may you see clearly God's love his
1:05:49
goodness his faithfulness may you see clearly
1:05:56
the promises that will come to pass may you go from instead of longing for them
1:06:04
and maybe even doubting may you go from that to being
1:06:10
expecting and excited for those promises as if they're already
1:06:18
here in Jesus name amen
