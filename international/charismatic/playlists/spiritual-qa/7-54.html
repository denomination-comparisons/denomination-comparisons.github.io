0:00
there is a question here where someone's spouse um isn't reading the
0:06
Bible and it's maybe affecting their health or thinking and so I just want to
0:11
answer this um the spirit of religion is one of the main reasons why
0:19
a believer has a hard time reading the Bible the spirit of religion that
0:25
condemns the spirit of religion condemns the spirit of religion makes spending time with Jesus
0:33
spending time in the word seem like a chore seem like hard and not fun this is
0:40
what that spirit of religion will will speak and then when you don't spend time in the word then the spirit of the
0:47
religion will condemn and when you receive that condemning voice when you listen to it it makes you
0:54
feel shame which makes you turn away from Jesus instead of turn to him so it makes it even harder to
1:01
read the Bible so and many times can be this cycle for people where they actually do want to read the Bible and
1:07
they don't know why it is so hard for them to just open up the Bible um and
1:14
so my my advice my suggestion is to just
1:19
really lovingly share let's read the word together like if you're a married couple like let's do this together let's
1:27
read the word together um and it can just be one chapter or if this person
1:32
really is just resistant or struggling so much it can be part of a chapter you
1:39
know just to do that a day even even spending just like five minutes as
1:45
opposed to zero is huge and once you take that
1:51
step your spiritual eyes open up wow this isn't so difficult this isn't a
1:56
chore this is actually a blessing to me and um wow what has been keeping me i
2:04
can't believe I've been missing this um and this felt like so difficult so
2:10
that's my suggestion to to do it not in a um judgmental way or a pressuring way
2:18
because that person's probably already dealing with guilt so you don't want to be a a voice of to add on to guilt so
2:27
just be sensitive to make it make you know be have it be an invitation that
2:32
you're doing this together instead of like you need to do this this is really important that you do this it's true
2:39
it's really important you need to do this but the person might not be in the place to receive it like that so that's
2:45
my um suggestion uh advice and I declare
2:51
that any spirit of religion any spirit that is
2:57
influencing this spouse to have this resistance towards the word
3:02
it must go in Jesus' name amen how do you know if you are
3:08
fully surrendered so the first part of this is like
3:14
really making the intention taking time with God to pour out your heart to him
3:20
and honestly surrender everything like really mean it to it's like a like a real covenant to God it's
3:28
not just like singing the song I surrender and just saying the words I surrender everything but I mean like I
3:34
remember for me the time when I I felt so convicted like I've actually
3:40
never never really surrendered my dreams my plan my
3:47
will i never really have done that and I felt this conviction one day when God opened up my
3:54
eyes to his love when I was tangibly encountering his spirit and I felt moved
4:01
i I I surrendered it all i surrendered my dreams my plan my will and I know the
4:08
day that that was i know I know the day that that was i I remember it vividly
4:14
the day I actually from my heart surrendered those things and I really meant it it was
4:20
honest um and so like nine months later when I received the prophecy over my
4:26
life it had already taken place that surrender so then when God's asking me to do something I don't want to do it
4:33
was like "Oh yeah I have to do that i I surrendered to God i I made that
4:38
decision." For me it wasn't like when when this prophecy came I was like "Okay I have a decision to make." For
4:46
me I had already truthfully surrendered to God it's like I had this conversation
4:52
with him covenant like whatever you want to do Lord if you want to take me a
4:58
different direction if you want to remove my dreams and replace them with yours you can do that Lord so I really
5:04
meant that and so I was like ready for it and so when it came it was like okay
5:09
yeah I' I'm surrendered um so take that first step of really
5:15
surrendering those things like every part every part and maybe as time goes on God reveals other things like you
5:21
haven't actually surrendered this maybe timeline of things of desires of your heart um and so there there's always
5:28
more and more things that as time goes on that that you'll realize oh I haven't actually surrendered everything yet
5:34
there's this too and so I surrender this to you Lord when you first make the intention when you first make that
5:39
covenant you have that conversation with God to surrender everything um then it will be
5:45
tested then it will be tested so like for me the prophecy came so this was like a test for me it wasn't like will
5:52
you surrender more right now it was really like I already decided to surrender more and so now is the test
5:57
like will I follow through with the choice that I made with a covenant that
6:03
I made how do you know if you surrendered everything well first of all have you made that real honest
6:12
covenant that real honest conversation with God where you were honest and where you really meant it like if he wanted to
6:19
literally replace dreams that you have with his will you say
6:24
yes if he wants to move you to a different place in the world will you
6:31
say yes if you have to give up things sacrifice things will you do that if you
6:38
have to go through a refining fire and really pay a price to be who God is
6:44
calling you to be and it's really uncomfortable the most uncomfortable thing you've ever gone through will you do that will you do
6:51
that um willingly peacefully without complaining
6:57
and fighting God you know will you do that so number one it's like is that the
7:03
intention of your heart is that the covenant that you've actually made with God so that's the first part and then
7:08
the second part of that is the testing so then there will be certain times where the action of surrender comes up
7:14
okay now it's time to actually sacrifice pay the price go through refining fire
7:21
um change directions um put your dream aside for God's dream will you stay in
7:28
line with what you made a covenant with God about will you follow through with
7:33
the action when those testing times will come you'll know and by the way that's a
7:39
great intimacy time with God is the testing times that I found when I have to make a choice to guard my
7:47
heart when I have to make a choice to keep my peace and keep my eyes focused on God and not get upset um when attacks
7:56
come my way when persecution comes my way when I have to really make an action
8:02
like take action like really make a choice when I have to make the choice to hold my tongue in that place of you know
8:10
making that choice to do the uncomfortable do what God is asking i
8:16
sense God's delight that he's proud i sense
8:22
that it it's precious it's like a deeper kind of intimacy than on other days you know because it's
8:31
a very significant choice of surrender choice to be after God's heart
8:38
in a deeper way when it's not easy you know there will be those moments
8:44
where you make that choice to obey God and in that moment you
8:50
should renew your mind to to hear God's voice to hear God's voice saying "I'm proud of you for choosing me i see that
8:58
you've made this choice." So it's important you know you hear God saying "He's proud of you." In those times I
9:03
don't mean hearing the audible voice and I always make sure I clarify that so
9:09
much of hearing God's voice is just renewing your mind to that truth you know like whenever you obey God God sees
9:16
it and he is proud of you his heart is touched he's saying "Well done my good
9:23
and faithful son daughter." So um it's important you
9:28
renew your mind to that truth that he is speaking that to be aware of that um but
9:34
then like all that's a that's a time where you're going to like have that rest and confidence knowing I'm
9:41
surrendered i'm surrendered so it's like when when these tests come up and you make that choice to obey God
9:50
you'll know like you're in that place of surrender if a different testing comes up and um you know you fear man over God
10:01
you um choose a prideful route action then the humble way you choose your
10:08
selfish ambition over what God is asking you to do that
10:14
he's been speaking to you maybe that he's speaking through your spiritual parent you you know you know what you're
10:19
doing you know what you're doing you know that you're being disobedient and so you know you're not
10:25
living in surrender at that time so it's it's quite simple it's not
10:32
complicated really to know if you're living surrendered to God it's important
10:38
to not be like religious about it like feeling like you're messing up all the
10:43
time when maybe you're not even messing up sometimes people can be so hard on
10:49
themselves like think that God has unrealistic expectations over them maybe
10:55
they beat themselves up because they didn't read for like a whole hour in the Bible that day or something when they
11:03
had made that plan and they said "Lord I'm going to read one hour of the Bible every single day." And maybe they think
11:09
God told them to do that but maybe God didn't tell them to do that maybe that was um a spirit of religion
11:16
speaking and so then one day they don't read a whole hour they read a little less than that and then they can think
11:24
"Oh I've messed up oh I've disobeyed God." When no you didn't actually God
11:30
wasn't asking you to do something religious and he's not He wasn't asking you to do something that's too high of a
11:37
like standard like that you couldn't meet type thing that's why I'm sharing like to know if you're living
11:42
surrendered isn't really complicated god looks at the heart bible the Bible says
11:48
to honor a mother and father how do you honor a parent who you had to set a boundary with and don't talk to because
11:53
of witchcraft and abuse so I know I've answered this question quite a few times so you can go back to look at other ones
11:59
for even more in depth but I will answer briefly um that Jesus also says when his mother and
12:09
brother are concerned about his well-being because of the persecution because of the attack that he's
12:14
experiencing Jesus says my true family are those who do the will of my
12:20
father so when it says honor the your father and mother in the Bible um well
12:27
first of all it's speaking like to the fact that they they raised you they did
12:34
a great work to to raise you to help you be alive at
12:40
least at least physically alive um and so that's worthy of honor in general
12:47
but it doesn't have to be like an honor where you
12:54
are constantly speaking every day with them and it it'll look different it'll
13:01
look different if the parent is being used by the enemy then obviously the
13:06
honor is going to look a lot different than if the parent was um a vessel of
13:13
God and didn't have open doors to the enemy that honor is going to look completely different so the Bible says
13:19
give honor where honor is due so the greater honor someone deserves the
13:25
greater honor one should give them the less honor one deserves the less honor one should give them
13:32
like still honor but you you don't you don't need to feel like this religious
13:38
um need to honor honor honor honor honor honor if a parent is being used by the
13:44
devil is doing witchcraft and these things like you say then what will the honor look like the honor will simply
13:50
look like um not gossiping about them like
13:56
speaking to others like my parents are so evil i'm so angry at them not
14:03
speaking that because God calls us to love our enemies to pray for those who persecute us not to bash them um also
14:12
we're not called to judge we're not in the place of judgment i mean jud judging others that's not our place that's God's
14:19
only the way you honor is if someone's doing bad things and they're like
14:24
deserving of um bad things happening to them i mean
14:30
we we don't feel anyone's deserving of that because you know we're not anyone to judge but what I'm saying is like
14:35
what you sew you reap so if they if if if they're hitting the cheek and they deserve to have the cheek hit back
14:43
um we don't hit the cheek back that's how we honor we don't hit them back
14:49
that's how we honor we don't go eye for eye so that's like eye for eye means
14:55
like you gashed out someone's eye you deserve to have that done to you too that's what I mean but the honoring way
15:03
is to not do that is to keep our mouth shut is to pray for them is to um love
15:11
them and only speak good things about them um of course it's like asking advice
15:19
like on a live like this is not considered gossiping or bad you know that I'm talking about like if you're
15:24
with friends and family or something and you're like my parents are doing are so
15:30
mean and evil da that's what I'm talking about so um and just yeah that that's
15:37
honor you don't have to like go above and beyond and do other things um in
15:43
that situation how do I know what to renounce when I have symptoms symptoms but I don't want
15:48
to go to the doctors very simple um watch my live from this past Wednesday
15:54
just to know what to do but I mean it's very simple i renounce sickness whatever the symptoms are I renounce these i
16:02
claim my healing i've seen these people be healed by this power of God i receive
16:07
this anointing for my life i must be healed i must be I must see this healing
16:13
fully in Jesus name it's it's simple it's not something like particular or
16:18
religious just whatever the symptoms are and you say you can say sickness in general pain in general you just
16:24
renounce that how do you know if you have the gift of tongues or if it's a demonic tongue a counterfeit like could you
16:30
think you're speaking in tongues but it really be a demonic tongue without you realizing if you were in bondage before
16:36
you have surrendered to Jesus and come to a church where God's power is so if
16:42
you were in bondage and demonic tongues many times are associated with
16:47
witchcraft with open doors to witchcraft um you know that's usually
16:53
the the the open doors where they will come is when a person is actively uh seeking out witchcraft or doing
16:59
witchcraft opening the door to witchcraft um and but a person will will
17:05
know that generally if they have that demonic tongue before so if you've never
17:11
experienced that before and now you're surrendered to God now you've been delivered you don't need to be paranoid
17:17
about this just having a demonic tongue and in general when you have been planted where
17:26
God's power is moving at a true anointed church you've received deliverance
17:32
you've been obedient you've come in person um when you can you know when
17:38
that's your life for months for a year you should rest knowing you are
17:46
free generally when it's true anointing that is there it is not going to be more
17:52
than several months until the layers of deliverance are all
17:59
gone okay so this is if you're surrendered and remember how I would just explain
18:06
surrender you got to make sure you're not um listening to the spirit of religion
18:13
and like thinking you're messing up when you're when you're not you know so if
18:20
your heart is truly wanting to please God and you're doing your
18:26
best regularly continually and you are planted at a true anointed church and
18:33
you are applying the teachings you're valuing the teachings and applying them and you've received deliverance you've
18:40
been there for months um you can rest knowing you've been set free
18:47
who who who the sun sets free is free indeed now that's different if you know
18:53
there's these doors that have been opened then oppression can come back um
18:59
but once again I just want to say this prophetically just make sure you're not listening to the spirit of
19:06
religion that's asking these high demands that Jesus isn't asking and so therefore you
19:13
think you're messing up when you're not and I'm answering this prophetically for you Autumn because I see this
19:20
prophetically um I know you had this question that I I want to answer now
19:26
like I just see the spirit of religion bringing this condemnation
19:31
and like you think you're messing up when you're when you're not because the spirit of religion is playing God in and
19:40
trying to make it seem like it's impossible to um follow God but God hasn't made it too
19:46
difficult to follow him like if you really have a heart to be in God's will and be
19:52
surrendered you are not going to struggle to follow him you're not going to struggle to be in his
19:59
will it's not going to be such a chore you have to pick up your cross there's a
20:06
there you know it's not always fun it's uncomfortable but it's not
20:12
unattainable at all my yoke is easy my burden is light Jesus says um and so you
20:19
can really just like flow in God's will when that's your heart every day it's
20:24
not a burden you don't wake up saying like "Oh man I hope I don't mess up today." It's not like that when your
20:30
heart really wants to be in God's will the Holy Spirit is helping you with
20:37
everything you know um so yeah but back to this question
20:43
um so when you your heart really wants to be in God's will and you're doing your best and you're applying God's
20:49
principles of being planted in a church where God's power is and you're applying the teachings and you've received layers
20:57
of deliverance after some time after some months you're free so it depends on
21:02
every situation some people they're completely delivered they're delivered of many demons demonic oppressions at in
21:08
one just one time complete freedom comes for other people it's a process and it
21:14
it goes layer by layer kind of like how the people who had leprosy who came to Jesus they weren't free just fast
21:21
immediately for some people it's not everything's gone immediately but you
21:28
shouldn't you shouldn't be under the impression that it's going to be years before you're fully free when it comes
21:34
to deliverance it'll it will not take more than a certain number of months at
21:39
the most that's when someone's really really being surrendered okay um and so
21:46
there is that scheme of the enemy to try to make someone think that they need more deliverance more deliverance so
21:52
that's something to be aware of um but yeah so if you are aware the
21:57
anointing is and you you're planted where that God's power truly is you can
22:02
rest so you don't have to be worried like do I have a demonic tongue is there a demon here in me you can rest this the
22:10
anointing is so powerful and so these things these demonic things they can't
22:15
stay that's the thing they they they cannot stay they don't have the power they don't have the authority to stay
22:22
jesus has the power and authority over them to cast them out and and by the way
22:27
and I shared this many times in my m my maintaining your deliverance message that's on my YouTube you know outward
22:34
attacks can really seem so similar to when you were demonically oppressed and so that's many times why people think
22:41
they still need deliverance that they still have demons so it's so important when you've been planted at a church
22:47
where God's power is and you've been keeping doors shut and surrendered um
22:54
it's important to be aware after you've received deliverance after you receive layers after months have passed and
22:59
you're finding these attacks and you're wondering is this a demon it's most likely the outward attacks that you can
23:07
resist and reject but it's not a need of deliverance it's that you are not that far from
23:13
Egypt on your way to the promised land egypt being the the land that you were
23:18
oppressed you you you you've left the shores you can hear this the sounds and
23:24
you see the sights of the city still um of the bondage land but you're not there
23:30
anymore but it's not that far away even if it was just a year ago you were
23:36
delivered it's still not that far away like that's why people who have been planted maybe for several
23:44
months or a year maybe they're still you know wondering if they're fully free or they're here they're they're they're finding these attacks you are free it's
23:52
just that you're not that far from Egypt yet but you keep getting further and further with every day you keep walking
23:57
in your authority rejecting the devil and eventually you won't hear any of that anymore you won't hear any of that
24:04
anymore for those who have been exalted and are shining brightly for Jesus I know it is still required for them to
24:10
remain humble how does one go lower after they have been
24:18
lifted so this starts in your heart and then it will flow out in your actions in
24:25
your words and everything you do it starts first in your heart so
24:32
um whenever God lifts me opens doors I thank him i thank him i thank
24:40
him and I I remind myself why this is happening why he is doing this it's not
24:48
for me it's for his people it's for his
24:54
glory it's for his purposes it's all about him it's all about his work it's
25:00
all about his people so the blessing that comes with being
25:07
lifted it's just important to keep your focus on Jesus and not because what
25:12
happens when one is lifted is that it's like sometimes the the selfish
25:19
ambition in the past of wanting to be seen wanting to have success cuz success
25:25
is like a lifting you know um wanting to be blessed
25:31
um like there's that there's that great desire there for many people
25:37
and why God takes us through a refining fire is so that we can get that out of
25:43
us so that's not such an it's not an idol and it's not such an intense passion but our intense passion
25:51
transforms to be to serve Jesus and what
25:56
his passions are is what what becomes our passion what he wants becomes our heart it takes
26:03
over these strong passions we would have before these strong passions we had
26:09
before that are always like selfish ambition or selfish things it's we want to be blessed we want success we want to
26:16
look important that's what everybody wants right and so Jesus changes that so
26:22
it's all about what Jesus wants that's one of the big things he
26:27
does in the refining fire that's one of the big things he does in that place of not getting what we
26:34
want but denying oursel and choosing God and
26:39
obeying him um anyway and not complaining and
26:45
through that he molds our hearts he changes us he supernaturally gives us his heart so
26:53
when a person's really gone through that refining fire then God will lift that
26:59
person god knows what he's doing he's his ways are perfect he knows like
27:04
the right time to lift a person he knows like that they will be trustworthy um as
27:10
he lifts them but I mean people at the end of the day still have free will but
27:16
um God does his part so if a person decides to open up doors to the enemy
27:22
like Saul for example who disobeyed God and then God took his anointing from him
27:29
but that was such a blatant choice like Samuel God sent Samuel to prophesy to
27:37
him it's important you destroy all of everything everything all the livestock
27:43
all the people destroy everything in this battle everything this is what God
27:48
speaks and then Saul straight up didn't do it you know like God made it very
27:56
clear and that's just an example I I I mean is like you don't need to be
28:01
paranoid um when God truly lifts you because he's taking you through the refining fire you don't need to be like
28:08
paranoid that you'll become like like Saul like that's like a real choice that
28:15
a person makes um and it's more on the rare side when God truly lifts a person what we see
28:21
what we see many times is people lifting themselves and not really being God
28:26
lifting a person it being the world system lifting a person we can see that in the church too like people being
28:33
self-appointed so when we're seeing a lot of people fall many times some lots of times it's it's not that they're a
28:40
bunch of Sauls you know that chose to disobey God after he lifted them but he
28:45
didn't actually lift them they lifted themselves the world system lifted them
28:51
the devil lifted them um and so yeah I mean I just share that to say that like
28:58
if you have a pure heart you shouldn't have this paranoia of um of like
29:05
falling you shouldn't have this paranoia you should have this rest in your heart you know knowing that God has led you
29:12
perfectly um to help you to help you follow his spirit like when you want to
29:17
when you truly want God's will um you know you can rest knowing that that's
29:24
your heart and that you don't have to be paranoid about missing something and that's important
29:31
because we have to have this godly confidence because when God lifts us to be leaders we're supposed to you know be
29:38
who we who he's called us to be we're not supposed to have this like false humility and this like
29:46
I don't know if I should really be here you know we we when God really
29:52
lifts you as a leader you you need to be confident in who he's called you to be
29:57
and rest knowing he's guiding you every step still being disciplined to do it as God is calling
30:05
you to do to keep your heart pure but you shouldn't be spending so much energy
30:11
and time you know like feeling afraid that
30:16
um you will fall or something but anyways to answer the question that the
30:21
question is when God lifts you how do you really go lower so I shared how it
30:26
starts with your heart so whenever God lifts me if he's doing some new kind of
30:31
like lifting I spend more time thanking him and in
30:37
meditation meditating about what he's done and how it's for his glory and how it's for his
30:43
people and just you know seeing this responsibility he's called me to
30:49
um so that I can steward well what he's
30:55
given me the new thing he's given keeping your heart in the right place
31:00
like rather than the old self of selfish ambition coming back in and like
31:08
liking the lifting for the wrong reasons just keeping your heart pure and
31:16
thanking God and guarding your heart because when lifting comes there's a
31:22
cost to the lifting there's a cost when the lifting comes the devil is shaking in his boots the devil's terrified the
31:28
devil is like freaking out like "What happened how did this happen?" Um and so
31:34
then he'll try to attack he'll try to stop it and what that looks
31:41
like isn't fun isn't comfortable to experience so with the lifting comes
31:48
that side of it and um there's a temptation there
31:53
to take your eyes away from praising God thanking God and seeing the seriousness
32:00
of what he's called you to and what the lifting is for there's a temptation to turn your eyes away from that and put it
32:08
to what the enemy is doing and if people are attacking you there would be then a temptation to be angry have bitterness
32:17
um try to defend yourself um and and just put your focus there and
32:26
when you're putting your focus there you're not putting your focus on praising God thanking God and
32:33
focusing on like meditating on the seriousness of what he's entrusting you
32:39
to of the lifting how it's for his people um yeah
32:45
like the message that I shared this past Sunday about protecting the heaven in
32:50
your heart you know and so if God is lifting you what he's put in there the peace the
32:57
joy the testimonies um the revelation of his love and and
33:02
just who you are in Christ like what how he's made you to shine how he's made you to represent
33:08
him that's what's the most important thing like he's lifting you to be a light he's lifting you to be a leader to
33:17
represent him he's lifting you to release the heaven he's put in you so
33:22
when you put your eyes to other things you put your eyes to the negative you're
33:28
not protecting your heart and so he lifted you to release that heaven that you have in your heart and now he's
33:37
lifted you you're looking other places and you're allowing it to be lost and so
33:43
you're not able to give fully what he the reason why he
33:49
lifted you to release you know so that's that's a big part too is is guarding your heart and
33:57
not letting any negative voice enter you enter your mind I just want to add to
34:03
that when God has lifted me for his glory That is when
34:09
I have found people attack me speak against me and make up things about me
34:14
and twist words I say um and say I'm from the devil and like the just the
34:21
worst things that anyone could say about somebody uh that's when these things have happened after the lifting when
34:28
people say things about you there will be a temptation to have pride like how
34:34
dare they say these things you know because if you are pure and you you are
34:40
truly called by God and you truly are carrying the anointing and you are truly surrendered and you're truly just
34:46
helping people um and then a person saying the opposite there's a temptation to be like
34:55
"How dare they say that all the good
35:00
that I'm doing for people do you know how I've sacrificed
35:06
and surrendered i didn't do that for myself i did that for other people how
35:12
dare they speak this and now they're leading people
35:18
astray they're going to think wrong about me like there will be a temptation
35:24
to think that way in your heart and or speak that
35:30
aloud and defend yourself those things are actually like those things are true
35:35
but those things are actually prideful because like Jesus didn't do that jesus Jesus had those things happen
35:41
to him but Jesus wasn't we don't see him doing that we don't see him like how
35:48
dare you do this you know do you know what I've done for people like it's true
35:56
but he just turned the other cheek he just kept doing the work of Jesus
36:02
instead of making the priority clearing his name making his reputation his
36:09
priority because when you um when you are a true servant of
36:16
God the devil will try to take you down in the same schemes he did towards Jesus
36:24
with these false accusations with saying that it's demonic powers casting out demons with saying you're a false
36:30
prophet um and he will use people who are jealous that's the people he
36:36
uses the people who can't stand you shining who can't stand that you're
36:44
that God has lifted you for his glory above them like doing higher things
36:49
higher level things for for Jesus he will always use like jealous people and
36:54
so like that's just going to happen and people who are jealous people who who do
37:01
these things like the Pharisees they are going to do what they're going to do you know you you can't reason with
37:08
them you you can't and so like you got to be mature to know that you got to be
37:13
mature to not reason with the devil you got to be mature to not like take your
37:19
focus off of doing the work of Jesus and try to convince the devil and the devil
37:24
working through people that they're wrong these Pharisees that got Jesus
37:29
crucified they were completely being used by the devil even Judas it says the
37:35
devil entered Judas so Judas was a vessel of the devil
37:40
to speak falsely about Jesus i mean when he sold Jesus out he was like
37:46
basically his action was saying I don't believe he is Lord and
37:52
Savior you know like his a that was an action even if he didn't say those words so these Pharisees that got Jesus
38:00
to be crucified um they were being used by the devil
38:05
completely they were completely vessels of the devil so how are you going to
38:11
reason with Judas how are you like Jesus Jesus says do what you must Judas like
38:16
he didn't waste time saying Judas like remember all the ways you experienced my
38:24
love remember Judas like remember you don't want to do this Judas you'll
38:30
regret this like at that point he had decided to be used by the enemy and so
38:37
Jesus knew that that was his choice and there wasn't anything he could do we're
38:44
given free will and so with servants of God you know we'll always have these Pharisee like people that are completely
38:51
used by the enemy and um you you can't reason with them and so we're not we're
38:56
not called to reason with them imagine if Jesus just like decided to stop his ministry and instead try to convince all
39:03
the Pharisees there wouldn't have been as many people saved healed and set free so
39:10
we're called to do what Jesus did and be like Jesus so um like in maturity when
39:17
you you hear people speaking against you after you've been lifted you know what's
39:23
going on you know you know this is the devil this isn't somebody's opinion this isn't that somebody is just confused
39:30
somebody's deceived this is the devil at work straight up like Judas like this is the
39:38
devil at work that's not a surprise that's not a surprise and we got to prepare ourselves for that and I see how
39:45
I've mentally prepared myself has really helped me be strong and mature because I
39:51
remember how the enemy came at me when we were in the dirt in the park just a
39:58
small group of people i mean not that big of people like 300 people in the
40:03
park or 100 people in the park i saw how hard the devil tried to stop me then and
40:09
I know like the prophecies that have been spoken over my life that are higher
40:15
than that are higher than where um we are now i I know like the devil's going
40:22
to be even more mad with what God has called me to do when those things happen
40:28
when God when it's God's timing when those doors open I know the devil's going to be even more mad so I just had
40:35
prepared myself like this is your journey this is your life it's not like you
40:42
finally passed through the persecution phase like just accept it like we just
40:48
got to accept that there's a devil out there but we have victory we just got to
40:53
accept that the devil will always be annoying but we have victory over him we
41:01
have to accept that and I'm getting into this Sunday's message there's gonna be more on this this Sunday now but we have
41:07
to accept that um there will be uncomfortable parts of the will of God
41:13
there there will be and spiritual maturity is not letting that um shake us
41:19
is not letting that take our joy is not letting that take our focus off of Jesus
41:24
i was so blessed by something my spiritual father had said to me like in the beginning when people started would
41:31
attack me and say these things about horrible things about me and everything and make videos about me it really hurt
41:37
and I was like so shocked that anyone could make up things out of nothing like
41:43
completely make something out of thin air i I hadn't experienced that kind of evil liars before i've been so blessed
41:49
that my family like I've never experienced them like lie and like friends I had at least that I knew about
41:56
i never experienced them like lie i was very sheltered i didn't know that people like just straight make things up out of
42:02
thin air and can like calmly and confidently speak it like with confidence so that was one thing and
42:08
then the second thing what it shocked me when that happened and then um also just
42:14
like the way people would twist things too the way people would twist things take things out of context and then also
42:20
um the way um people would be so judgmental you know like that they you
42:26
could you know like what happened to giving someone the benefit of the doubt or what happened to um hearing the other
42:34
side of the story not just one side of the story like the Bible says you know what happened to you know don't judge a
42:40
book by its cover people just seeing one thing and making up a story you know
42:46
rather than like taking time to really look and see the truth right so when
42:52
that all happened it was so hurtful it was
42:58
painful and I didn't doubt for a second that the plans for God would come to
43:03
pass still but it was so hurtful and then I would see how um people were like
43:10
believing the lies and that was really hard just difficult and so I would like
43:15
share with my spiritual father and I would cry and [Music]
43:21
um you know God gave me strength hallelujah like it it wasn't like it
43:28
wasn't like every day crying but it was so painful and then my spiritual father
43:33
had said as time passed like years passed and then there were like I just shared like oh like this attack happened
43:39
like a person speaking against you know I just like shared it casually and I shared it just um just like matter of
43:46
fact like just just keeping my joy and stuff and he was like oh you've matured
43:53
so much you I remember when you used to cry and that really blessed my heart and
44:00
it just like it really taugh taught me i was like I when he told me that I was like I want to help other people mature
44:08
faster you know i want to prepare people i want to prepare people so they're not shaken when persecution comes they're
44:15
not like so hurt you know like they don't let it hurt them like it is it is
44:20
hurtful but like we don't but it's the devil like he doesn't we don't have to let him win we don't have to let him get
44:27
to us we don't have to let the weapon formed against us prosper and so he'll
44:33
send na n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n nasty vicious attacks towards us lies but it's not going to prevent Jesus
44:39
from winning it's not going to prevent God's plans from happening in our lives so we don't have to actually let it hurt
44:45
us that much or at all hallelujah the maturity is just knowing the devil hates
44:51
us he's going to use people and do evil things but he won't win nothing's going
44:57
to stop God's plan for our lives so I'm going to keep my joy it's a waste
45:03
of time to let the enemy steal my joy and focus on this that takes humility
45:09
though right because you got to you're you're you don't that means you don't care what people say or think about you
45:15
that means that you have to be okay with people thinking horrible things about you that aren't true and that you're
45:22
just okay with that like you just it is what it is you
45:27
know there are people my whole life you know that will probably just be thinking
45:33
this that I'm from the devil like like what they thought about Jesus there were
45:38
so many people thinking these wrong things about Jesus that that's why he was crucified so but we're that's beautiful when you
45:47
can get to that place of not caring because that means you've been transformed to be humble hallelujah
45:55
hallelujah and just be completely after the father's heart and not about what people think about you
46:01
amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God a friend who's also planted
46:08
online comes from an extremely relig Hindu family but wants to share her testimony without severe pressure and
46:14
threats from her husband and family she has no job and is scared to lose her little girls is it wise to share her testimony publicly risking the
46:20
possibility of losing her daughters so I'm just going to answer a general I'm going to answer this generally because I
46:26
think there's a lot of people that can um this this will apply to so when
46:32
you're facing situations like this there's a way to share your testimony in a wise manner let me give
46:39
one example that I mean by this right now okay let's say that a person is delivered from thoughts and attractions
46:46
of homo of same sex that they battled with a long time maybe they lived in
46:51
that lifestyle and now they're having a conversation with somebody who has also
46:59
battled with these things and wants to be free of these things and so this
47:04
person should testify in detail like very in detail share okay but now let's
47:11
say let's say that you are in the office place you're in the workplace
47:19
and there is a person in the workplace who is is a believer is open to the move
47:28
of God to the power of God you know maybe they haven't come to church yet or something but they're they're open
47:33
they're showing signs that they're open but let's say that this person is living in the same sex attraction um
47:44
like homosexual lifestyle like they they consider they identify themselves this way and you can see that they truly
47:52
believe that that's okay like God made them this way um like they really
47:58
believe that and they're not at an open place to hear
48:04
truth to um to to hear the spiritual truth in
48:11
this area but they're open in all other areas they're very open so the wise
48:17
thing to do is to not preach something and testify
48:24
something in an area where a person is not open because for a person to be open
48:30
that's where you can plant a seed if they're not open you can't plant that seed and it can do more harm than good
48:36
it can push them away make them feel like they're being judged and hated so
48:42
the wise thing to do is they're open share your testimony share about how God
48:48
has changed you by his power transformed you delivered you from maybe other things he's delivered you from maybe
48:53
depression and anxiety you say that and then you also say God als I used to
48:58
really battle with identity lies of the devil against my identity against my
49:04
identity against whom God has called me to be against whom God created me to be i used to battle with that i used to
49:10
battle with these lies and I used to be confused but then God delivered me by
49:17
his power and these thoughts that I struggled with they left they completely
49:23
left and now I have this clarity of who God has made me to be and I have such peace in my mind and
49:32
you know you do you see how I do you see how I shared that
49:38
do do you see how I shared that with wisdom you know so when we're talking
49:45
about sharing honestly our testimony it does not mean that in every situation
49:52
you have to disclose every little tiny detail you know it doesn't mean that
49:59
it's important that you are sharing with with wisdom and even that testimony that
50:05
version of the testimony I shared is completely truthful it's not like withholding things really and even that
50:11
can be so powerful because that can plant seeds in a person um to realize
50:16
like oh like yeah I do have confusion myself about my identity
50:21
um and I think I'm gay like they can think that but sometimes I'm confused
50:26
sometimes I'm not sure like you know what I mean like even that can plant seeds that can cause a person to open up
50:32
to then maybe eventually having that different conversation that's um the
50:38
first version of the testimony that I shared you see and so I share that as a
50:44
blanket testimony about I mean blanket lesson of how you should share with your
50:49
testimony with wisdom depending on the situation like for most people for them
50:55
to testify and say like 99.9999 to 100%
51:00
of the time if a person says I'm delivered or my kid is delivered of depression anxiety addictions
51:07
um uh seizures um migraines uh for a person to testify that there's
51:14
no reason to withhold to say things differently you know like for most cases
51:20
most times this whole like way of wisdom wisdom in sharing your testimony where
51:26
you you you change how it is shared you still share it but you change how it is shared is having to do with
51:32
um situations where people you know like like for example um homosexuality like
51:39
how that's like a sensitive issue we like we we want to make sure we're not coming off as like judgmental you know
51:45
and pushing someone away if a person is Hindu and they just you know it is it is
51:53
important to share Jesus has set me free this is my testimony this is what I've
51:59
experienced um and have faith that there's nothing wrong with doing that
52:05
there's I mean that the enemy cannot just like take their family from them
52:11
from for for saying that like that's God is God is going to come and
52:18
protect and there's nothing to fear nothing to worry about how you need to walk in wisdom is to not be pushy if
52:24
they don't want to hear it then you don't need to be put shoving it down their throats you don't need to be talking about it at all to them if they
52:30
really are closed off but in terms of sharing um like online or with other
52:36
people in your life like this is my story to share it with peace and gentleness without trashing your family
52:43
being like Hindu is so demonic you know that might not be the time to be like Hindu is so demonic Hinduism
52:51
religion you know that might not be the time you know you can share that with people who are open to hear that but
52:59
there's a way with wisdom to say Jesus has set me free without speaking in a
53:05
way that's not necessary that would rock the boat unnecessarily
53:11
um and cause you to seem hateful towards your family members ers it's walking in wisdom like that so it's it's just going
53:19
to depend on the situation can we be assured of our salvation yes i've answered this quite a few times before
53:24
but just as I shared earlier in this live about resting in your surrender you don't need to live in paranoia god
53:31
doesn't want you to live in paranoia he looks at the heart and so if your heart
53:37
is to please God and you're doing your best I'm not saying that you're 100% perfect every single second i'm saying
53:43
you're trying your best because God has grace his grace is always there so
53:49
you're trying your best you know just like a parent if you imagine you have a
53:55
kid are you expecting them to be 100% perfect if they make a mistake and they genuinely are sorry are you going to
54:01
have grace for them or are you just going to say "Too bad you lose the inheritance I was going to give you
54:07
because you made one mistake." Um too bad i'm kicking you out of the house and I'm rejecting you forever because you
54:14
made one mistake are you going to do that to your child how much more Jesus i mean how much more is Jesus's grace how
54:20
much more is Jesus's love how much more is his understanding if you can just picture yourself having a child like you
54:26
want the best for them you want them to win you're cheering them on this is how Jesus is for you always so when you are
54:34
surrendered to God and doing your best you can rest knowing you're going to heaven you shouldn't ever spend a second
54:42
worrying about it or wondering if you won't now it's different if someone is
54:47
in complete disobedience to God they should be thinking about that and that's
54:53
they're out of pride they're not thinking about that they're not having the fear of God
54:58
that's why they're they're continuing this way but what I mean when I know
55:04
most of you who are here if not all do want to please God are doing your
55:10
best are surrendered to God and so you don't need to the devil the devil comes
55:17
to steal kill and destroy he wants to steal your peace he wants to steal you're not supposed to be spending your time thinking about I wonder if I'll
55:24
really go to heaven or not throughout your day you're seated in heavenly places with Jesus right now that's what
55:30
you're supposed to be thinking on you're supposed to be having your mind in the
55:35
right place like seeing God's love rightly and seeing his love for you and
55:40
that he's proud for you not wondering if he's shaming you you know so you can
55:47
rest you can rest how to navigate my husband and I being at two different
55:52
churches I'm planted at 5F and not let it divide us and the kids well I know
55:58
there has been one there's been a couple I'm thinking of now and more than one
56:03
but where the spouse they were planted at two different churches but then then
56:08
the spouse ended up coming to 5F and being planted and it is so beautiful to
56:14
see how the spouse is so blessed and so full of joy at 5F and it didn't happen overnight i
56:21
think it was more than a year I think or maybe almost two years before that took
56:27
place so um just know that God is working and just just the thing for you
56:33
to focus on is to plant seeds and to be the best representative of Jesus as possible because usually usually if
56:40
someone's planted at a different church it's usually not where God's power really is and is usually in religion so
56:49
that's why I'm saying as if like they should be planted at 5F that's why I say it like that i'm not
56:56
saying like everyone must be planted at 5F but what I'm kind of saying this right now is like let's answer this for
57:03
everybody for anybody who's listening right now if you're not planted at 5F but you're planted at a church where God's power is okay and your spouse is
57:10
not planted at a church where God's power is they're planted somewhere else somewhere else so I'm speaking it like in that kind of in that way
57:19
um so anyways ha have you know if that's the case know that God does want your
57:25
spouse to be planted at the church you're planted at where God's power is moving
57:30
um and know that that's what God wants okay and so know that God's working and
57:37
so know that God's using you and God's using you to plant seeds so the best thing for you to do is to be a seed
57:43
planter and how you do that is by being patient being
57:50
peaceful and just being so loving like because every day especially well when
57:58
you're planted where God's power is you're going to be transforming more into the image of God and your spouse
58:03
will notice that they may not say it but they will notice it and so be even more
58:09
loving even more Christlike even more patient even even more um just speaking
58:16
words that are kind and gentle like be even more so that way loving way every
58:24
day and God is going to work through that and God this is how God is going to help open spiritual eyes they're going
58:32
to see whoa they are more like Jesus i want to be more like Jesus they are more
58:39
like Jesus because they've been receiving from this church where the power of God is moving so it'll open
58:46
their eyes humble them help them to see because the reason why a person like a
58:51
spouse isn't planted where you are planted if you are planted where God's power is moving is because their eyes
58:57
are closed like in their mind they think that the church that doesn't have the power of God isn't lacking but it's
59:05
really lacking you know and so what needs to happen is their eyes to open up and how that will happen is by the
59:12
kindness of God leading to repentance the kindness of God the love coming through you um to to to help open their
59:20
eyes to not be forceful to not be prideful to not be judgmental and then in terms of the
