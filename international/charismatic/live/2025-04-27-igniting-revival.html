48:18
visitors each Sunday if you have a testimony we want to share it on the stage but we need to know about it
48:23
because if everyone raises their hands I can't call you all up here and here you know what I mean so any Sunday that God
48:28
does something or maybe it happened a while ago but you've never testified we want to share not just the videos but we
48:34
want to hear all together in the house of God and celebrate and give God glory amen so even next Sunday if you can
48:41
visit that table before church starts and share your testimony amen

49:00
for uh 25 years about so and um
49:08
uh this time I will stand on the ceiling there was u before when Todd White came
49:15
to Germany I al also uh released a cry
49:20
and uh there was no healing i could not uh stand the healing it got worse and but this time I will stand on the
49:27
ceiling and don't let the devil take it away from me so I uh have a list of
49:34
things or what uh of illnesses and so and I uh
49:43
I crossed it i crossed it i crossed a bipolar disease totally you cross off
49:48
bipolar disease that it is gone wow so what did you experience at the
49:55
conference and like after for you to say this right now i had to release a cry
50:02
when you uh were uh setting me free in Jesus name and um glory to God and
50:11
um I uh I'm a little bit sad that I did not experience uh Jesus more to see him
50:19
more is my most wish I have the biggest wish I have is to see him more and to
50:25
hear him more and okay I I hope that this will happen too that I will see him
50:32
more and hear him more amen and so ever since this conference did you find a
50:37
change in your mind more peace
50:44
more faith more faith hallelujah i also have a testimony to share so um I
50:52
was addicted to porn for a long time i always I already started at a young age because we had a a spirit of lust um you
51:00
prayed for us last Sunday and I believe I was completely delivered i haven't done it since uh for more than a week
51:07
now and I can feel beforehand for many years I've tried to
51:14
fight this addiction for 5 years and it was always a fight that was impossible for me to win like it was so frustrating
51:20
i one time I cried for longer than an hour straight and um but now it it's
51:26
finally a fight that has been possible with Jesus like it's now it was now attacked from the outside before it was
51:32
attacked from the inside and I'm so glad I'm last night I had the one of the most
51:39
beautiful moments of my life when I realized all that is possible with God and I'm also so happy with what you're
51:47
doing with your authority i think you're doing really well and that you're that you're using your authority so well and
51:54
praise God glory to God wow praise God
52:02
who the sun sets free is free indeed you are free indeed i had I used that verse
52:08
actually this week i that I found that verse and I proclaimed it every time and it's funny that you say that right now
52:15
it's prophetic it's God confirming that's God confirming to you that there's no question you are completely
52:22
free from that you were completely free and God saw your heart because because
52:28
you have a pure heart and you did not want to be doing that doing that sin you
52:35
were in bondage you needed freedom and it's only the anointing that brings freedom it's only the anointing that
52:41
destroys yoke so that was the difference this time you encountered the anointing and the yoke was destroyed
52:49
hallelujah hallelujah and I want that list that you have one
52:54
has been crossed off now of this list bipolar praise God and I want to I want
53:00
to see all of them crossed out from now so I I and I cross them out in the
53:09
spiritual realm spiritual realm and I detach you from all of these things i
53:15
break every curse off of you i break every word curse every generational curse every curse of witchcraft and I
53:22
declare every spirit attached to every one of these things they all must leave
53:28
your life now in Jesus' name be free from all of these things
53:36
they are gone from your life now may your taste be returned may Hashimoto's

how many years the the gentleman from Germany young man from Germany how many
54:31
years 19 no how many years did you struggle with that
54:39
when you were eight you started watching porn come come come if you could just share
54:46
that yeah so um I was I started watching it from a very young age my father had a
54:52
similar experience but I don't want to share the details of that and actually I
54:58
was freed from it once i had a moment where I was walking with Jesus on a river in the park of my city and I was
55:07
free for weeks but then I fell back to it and it got worse like I think that's
55:14
when that's when it became really impossible for me but from then on out
55:19
um it it was really bad but now it's all gone i'm free amen so you're 19 now and
55:28
so since you were eight look what God has done and this is for everyone here you know anything
55:34
you've been struggling with for many many many years Jesus wants to deliver you and heal you today right now because
55:42
his power is here this is possible amen hi Daniel daniel's from Sweden 5f Church
55:48
family from Sweden so so happy to still have you here this week as well i'm so blessed i'm so so blessed
55:57
praise God i love this ministry i love you Apostle i love Jesus i don't know
56:04
what to I'm blessed praise God i've been serving in new levels i got to shoot for
56:10
for a special project with the with a whole bunch of fivefold me five-fold
56:16
members uh at rise and shine and I've just seen things fall off me and
56:21
impartation of anointing come like uh never before while serving in this new
56:27
level and uh yeah like a lot of you guys knew and know I want to share about uh a
56:34
thing that just recently uh happened and I was super duper set free yesterday at
56:40
uh a Zoom meeting can I get this yeah we're preparing for our small groups
56:45
that are going to be beginning around the world soon and so we had a I had a
56:51
Zoom meeting uh to equip them and prepare them uh for the small groups that are about to begin so we had that
56:57
yesterday that meeting amen so I I just need to share that like I was struggling
57:03
before because of like childhood trauma uh since a young kid I would run to
57:08
really bad foods like junk food and candy and all this and overindulge since
57:14
a very young age and like spend a lot of money on it and gluttony in this area it
57:20
was a huge thing and my flesh was so strong right and so the Lord led me on a
57:25
fast last year for 30 days to eat very little and a different diet and uh I I
57:32
lost a lot of weight lost a lot of muscle it was all Holy Spirit led but I failed the the the test i got another
57:40
shot but when I went at that one for I think 30 days at the end of those I I
57:45
failed again and a lot of you guys know about this i went into gluttony super hard again and the the devil came and he
57:52
lied to me that I was an apostate and that I left the Lord and that his spirit could never come with me again and I
57:59
thought my life then would consist of now living my life without his presence until I die and go to hell and that was
58:06
the I just believed it cuz it was so strong and I failed so hard at this this
58:12
test right so I almost actually got tricked into committing suicide and I
58:17
feel so strongly to just share this because it's so powerful that the Lord
58:22
was still with me in that lie that was so heavy he was still there and he used
58:27
this i ended up in the hospital at this second try right because my BMI was 13 i
58:34
weighed like 101 pounds i had like no muscles i could barely walk or stand up
58:39
cuz I was ready to like really die for the Lord for this test cuz I wanted to be transformed but I went too hard and
58:46
so he used the hospital experience to heal me from past trauma he used the staff in the hospital to mirror me and
58:54
and give me everything I needed when I came out of the hospital after about a month uh I was completely set free from
59:02
all past childhood trauma cuz I got all the attention and healing that I needed
59:07
in there from people and and love god used these people to to love on me and
59:13
he built me up i got to eat again but then he said "Daniel you cannot bypass spiritual tests and you have to fast
59:20
this so I can remove it because I want to protect your heart for your calling so that you're not attached to this
59:25
thing that is not healthy for you because I want people to be saved through you i want people to be healed
59:31
through you and you need to be transformed for this." So I said "Okay Lord let's go." I went two first weeks
59:39
after February or something i I failed again and it was so hard this test cuz I was also working hard with my body
59:46
evangelizing and while not eating much but he gave me supernatural strength and then a day before arise and shine I knew
59:54
it was the last day and I passed the test praise God but I've never seen this
1:00:00
supernatural strength honestly like barely eating anything and working super
1:00:06
hard flying long helping people to move doing a whole bunch of stuff and he gave
1:00:12
me supernatural power to pull through and when I came the first day at Arise and Shine I uh the first day I got a hug
1:00:22
from from Pastor Heather and I fell down under the anointing on my knees when she
1:00:28
left started crying and the Lord spoke to me "Daniel you did perfect you have
1:00:34
it's it's done it's finished you're you're transformed now you don't have to do this anymore you're free i'm free
1:00:41
from this gluttony is not my portion none of that is my portion i don't have any appetite for it i started eating
1:00:48
again and it was so strange to my body to have food again right and I'm sharing this because I know somebody's going to
1:00:54
get set free today in Jesus' name so it was difficult to start eat again i I
1:01:00
felt condemnation and these voices angel of light and I struggled with like enjoying food again and I wanted to but
1:01:08
I started thinking so much about food and I was like that's not okay i want to think about Jesus only but and now I'm
1:01:14
thinking about food again and it's weird and so the devil came and the just uh
1:01:21
two two three days ago uh spoke that you know I had failed again with just like
1:01:27
eating one piece of bread too much i know some of you are struggling with this and now I I believe this lie so
1:01:34
then I went into the fast again and started isolating and was like for two weeks I'm going to go this super hard
1:01:41
fast and already where I'm at like with my muscle mass and my body weight like this if I go even harder and further it
1:01:48
can actually be dangerous again so the enemy almost got me but yesterday at the
1:01:54
Sue meeting like I hadn't told anyone about this and I was blessed with food from somebody from Fivefold Church cuz I
1:02:01
needed help right i was about to give away all my food and go on this super hard fast again and I was just started
1:02:09
crying during this sue meeting because the love of God came over me so hard and there were a lot of people actually that
1:02:15
were touched by the love of God but all of a sudden in this sue meeting that it's about the the small groups meeting
1:02:22
uh international worldwide apostle started speaking over me declaring and
1:02:27
his holy spirit through her just Daniel stop over crucifying your flesh stop
1:02:34
with this perfectionism be merry be happy and eat
1:02:40
enjoy your life with the holy spirit now hallelujah
1:02:48
Hallelujah and I was just about to go on this crazy fast and give away all my
1:02:54
food and then afterwards you have no idea how this set me free because I have
1:02:59
the ultimate confirmation and Apostle Katherine you are 100 million% from God
1:03:06
because nobody could have known that this ministry is prophetic if you're not sold on this this is it come on now
1:03:13
let's go let's go hallelujah so after that let me tell you
1:03:21
that before the Sue meeting I went and spent money in the store which I shouldn't have on like plastic utensils
1:03:27
and stuff cuz I was going to give it away to homeless right nothing wrong with that but it's not that time i spent
1:03:33
money I shouldn't have spent and all this stuff ready to give away my food had a little oatmeal half a cup of tea
1:03:39
because that's what the freaking devil was telling me loser total loser after the sue meeting I go into
1:03:46
the kitchen i have two avocado sandwiches with salmon right and an
1:03:54
omeolet and it was the best lunch of my life hallelujah

you Jesus wow you see the the devil comes in all these different tricky sneaky ways sometimes he comes as the
1:04:45
angel of light just sounding spiritual sounding like God and this is why we

1:04:58
devil's God's voice you know that's why you need to be planted that because this

worshiping Jesus jesus loves the children and the elderly the
1:16:59
same and freedom and healing and abundant life and peace and joy and relationship with God is supposed to be
1:17:05
god wants it to be for children elderly and everybody in between remembering my
1:17:11
whole life experienced being engulfed in the fire of God with so many people
1:17:18
before the conference started people were worshiping after the conference ended people were worshiping it was like
1:17:24
uncontainable praise and joy our God is an awesome God our God is an awesome God
1:17:33

1:17:54
changed our lives for the good sunday I went to church and then I felt like
1:18:01
something was wrong with my eyes and then Wednesday it became really swollen
1:18:06
like really really swollen one day before we come to LA it's like if the devil didn't want me to come here we
1:18:12
went like to the doctor and they said that it's not a good idea to come here because if I come here it could get more
1:18:20
swollen and they told me to take a medicine but I didn't take the medicine i had faith that if I come to Arise and
1:18:28
Shine it's going to get healed so then I came to the first session i
1:18:34
was really blessed like I felt Jesus came in my body and healed me so then I
1:18:40
went to sleep and I didn't put any medicine or didn't put like any ice packs on my eyes and then when I woke up
1:18:48
my eyes were healed the end of the conference earlier
1:18:54
that day you were speaking and you were praying over people and a weight just came off my shoulders i like before that
1:19:01
I felt tired i felt like I couldn't do anything i feel like I could run a marathon right now hallelujah god freed

1:22:10
wow and God completely blew us away this year completely surpassed all
1:22:17
expectations that people five of church family people came from 52 nations this year in one year amidst
1:22:27
and and and and and and like a month and a half prior the enemy was bringing spiritual
1:22:36
warfare was bringing attack towards this move of God in a new level new devil
1:22:41
kind of way like I'd never seen before and the fact that people came from all
1:22:48
of those nations that means that this is truly God's army just like Gideon's army
1:22:56
you know ju this is truly God's army doesn't matter how big the army looks
1:23:02
coming against you how much the enemy is trying to stop you when you are really in God's army you have the angel armies
1:23:09

1:23:31
all of you who traveled some of you are here you're still here you've traveled i'm so proud of all of you who are
1:23:37
watching now who traveled who made the effort who made this sacrifice to travel
1:23:42
from around the world i know for many of you it was a sacrifice it was pure
1:23:47
obedience to God and your faith and making a sacrifice that you were here
1:23:53
and I'm so proud of you and I thank you i thank you on behalf of God's kingdom i
1:24:00
thank you as a leader here as a leader here at 5F Church I thank you for making
1:24:07
that effort to stand with us to stand with this army to take your place in
1:24:13
God's army to take a stand against the devil and to be obedient to God to rise
1:24:20
up and worship him with all of your hearts and receive from him what he had
1:24:27
for you i am proud of you and I thank you hallelujah all of you watching
1:24:33
online I am proud of you and I thank you god is so proud of you god is so
1:24:42
proud hallelujah you have touched God's heart so much and you have touched my
1:24:48
heart and I also want to thank all of you here here at 5F Church here in LA
1:24:54
and all of you watching online all of you who sacrificed and made
1:25:00
contributions financial contributions sewing into this work of God so that this conference would have been pos
1:25:06
could have been possible because if you didn't it wouldn't have been possible because this is how God moves he doesn't
1:25:11
he doesn't drop money from the sky he does not do that he uses people he uses
1:25:17
his children as vessels and so if you weren't obedient to that that conference wouldn't have
1:25:24
happened so I thank you so much for making that
1:25:29
sacrifice and for sewing and for continually sewing into this work of God
1:25:35
so that we can keep serving God's people and keep expanding God's kingdom all
1:25:41
over the world every week here in LA and all over the world at all of the events
1:25:47
that are to come and that have passed already amen thank you i bless you and
1:25:53
I'm proud of you amen hallelujah praise
1:25:59
God all right well today I'm going to be teaching on how to ignite revival in
1:26:07
your city in your nation in your workplace in your family wherever you go
1:26:15
how to ignite revival amen
1:26:22
i remember something that my spiritual father said and it really my spiritual father prophet Joe Davyy he said to me I
1:26:28
mean he didn't say to me he said actually it was um it was one time where he he ministered at a conference here in
1:26:35
LA um and it was it was before actually 5F church began and I I invited him here
1:26:42
I hosted him here and um there's something that he spoke when he was here
1:26:47
ministering he spoke something like this it only takes a
1:26:53
spark to ignite a wildfire a
1:26:59
wildfire doesn't begin as a wildfire a wildfire begins as a
1:27:05
spark that word stuck with me and I realized how much that word was for me
1:27:12
and that I was that spark that God was speaking in that moment
1:27:19
um I received the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle and I was called
1:27:25
to reach the nations and about a year after that prophecy was released upon my
1:27:30
life and I started after I had already started 5F Church then Prophet Joe Davyy prophesied that God has heard America's
1:27:37
prayers for revival and he is answering them now revival is
1:27:43
now and it is going to start is starting in LA spreading across the US and will
1:27:48
spread across the whole world and um from there I knew God was calling me to
1:27:54
just speak revival is now in obedience even though it didn't look like it in the physical and from there for about
1:28:02
four or so years um the church our church decreased literally every year
1:28:09
from 20some to down to two over four years each year decreasing but all
1:28:14
through that time I would declare "Revival is now." Jean Paul and I wrote a song "Revival is now your kingdom is
1:28:22
here." We we made shirts that said "Revival is now." And um I remember
1:28:28
being in our amphitheater in the park when there was just a couple of us and passionately saying revival is now and
1:28:37
um the the the truth of the matter was is there was a spark there there was a
1:28:42
spark there there was a true supernatural revival spark there in that
1:28:47
moment it had not yet caught on fire it I mean it had not caught uh into a
1:28:54
big it hadn't spread yet but there was a spark you know how powerful a spark is
1:29:02
that it can ignite a wildfire that spreads thousands and
1:29:07
thousands of acres it begins as a spark how powerful a spark is
1:29:13
amen so but one little spark if you think you're supposed to be a wildfire
1:29:18
and you are a spark but the calling for your life is to be a wildfire or is to be part of something massive to be part
1:29:25
of a wildfire and here you are as a spark it feels like impossible it feels like you have a long ways to go but the
1:29:34
thing is is that when you are in God's will when you are in his will when you
1:29:42
are in the prophetic word when you are aligned with the prophetic word with the word that God
1:29:49
has spoken over your life over the body of Christ over the the the the church the ministry that you're part of the
1:29:55
move of God if you're in line with that that spark there is
1:30:00
supernatural and with the wind of the Holy Spirit it will spread into a
1:30:06
massive wildfire that will shock you so much it will shock
1:30:12
you and so I went out in the park we were out in We were out in the park when
1:30:18
CO hit and before that we were in in in a gym and sometimes there would be
1:30:24
nobody that would show up to the worship night not a single person and we would still have worship nights and we would
1:30:30
uh uh have the live stream going not knowing if anybody was watching and that was years after starting the church but
1:30:38
we kept going we kept the spark going it was a choice to keep the spark going it
1:30:45
we could have chosen to snuff it out and stop and do something different but we
1:30:51
kept the revival is now spark ignited as a choice as obedience to God amen and in
1:31:02
God's timing that spark indeed turned into a wildfire that is spread across
1:31:08
the whole world hallelujah hallelujah and so a a lot of people they may they
1:31:16
could try to do the same thing that I did that we did they could try to do the
1:31:21
same thing they could if but but if God didn't send them if God didn't call them
1:31:26
you know if if they're just doing something in their own effort their own ambition they're doing something they're
1:31:32
they're looking like "Oh look at the success that this person had i'm going to try to copy that and do that." You
1:31:38
know they can try to do that but they will be lost forever it will not work for them if God
1:31:45
didn't call them to do this or really if God if they are not in
1:31:51
line with God's word God's prophetic word God's will because you can see something that
1:31:58
you like you can see you can see revival over here and say "I want to copy
1:32:04
copycat that but I don't want to be a part of that i love this revival that I'm seeing i
1:32:11
love this move of God that I'm seeing but I want to start that or I want to do
1:32:17
my own and put my own flavor twist to it and do make it a little more religious
1:32:23
make it a little more um less controversial you know you can be that
1:32:30
you can a lot of people do that and it won't work for them that's what I mean about it you you can be lost you need
1:32:37
the spiritual GPS god has spoken this prophecy over your life god has spoken this prophecy
1:32:44
over this move of God when you are in line with that you are following the GPS
1:32:49
and you will make it to the destination that spark that you carry will turn into a wildfire
1:32:56
but you can conjure up your own spark you can do your own spark kind of thing and it's like there's no GPS destination
1:33:04
i mean there's no GPS there's no that you you have the maps up you ever put the maps app up but you don't put the
1:33:11
destination it's like you have the maps app up and you're trying to do the same thing you know and it's it won't
1:33:19
work it's but but when you have the GPS when you have the destination in there
1:33:25
meaning God has spoken this this has been prophesied he has called you for
1:33:32
this and therefore he has equipped you for this he has released impartation of anointing to you for this and he has
1:33:40
told you how this will happen such as you need to plant yourself where he's
1:33:45
calling you to be planted you need to follow the principles of God that are in his word being planted as one of them
1:33:53
and you to need to be in order you need to be obedient you need to be
1:33:58
humble humble to the the prophetic words released to the words of direction released
1:34:06
and and if you will do that it's like you have the the the the GPS in there
1:34:12
you have the the destination in there in the the and and and you can be in a
1:34:18
barren land but not be concerned because you you know how you trust your
1:34:25
GPS like if you take a any kind of road trip like a road trip across the US or any kind of road trip you start in your
1:34:31
city that you're comfortable with and there's so much going going on but maybe you're going several hours away and then you go into a land that's so different
1:34:38
from where you came from and so different from where you're going and it
1:34:43
doesn't look a thing like where you're going and in fact it looks barren you're about you're supposed to go to a promised land to an exciting city or
1:34:49
something that's beautiful and lush and you are in the desert like
1:34:55
Nevada you are in barren land and no plants inside no tree in
1:35:02
sight but if you have the destination in the GPS plugged in you're not concerned
1:35:09
you're not worried you're not you know this is temporary and you know where you are
1:35:15
going you know you can trust that GPS you know you will for sure reach that
1:35:20
destination and this is just part of the journey this is necessary to get to the
1:35:25
destination it can't be from from uh uh LA to Las Vegas or LA to San Francisco
1:35:35
direct five minutes it can't be city city city city city lush lush lush there's going to be a desert and
1:35:41
barrenness in between there's no other way that's just the journey and so this is when I
1:35:48
received these prophecies over my life this is exciting before I received the prophecies I was pursuing music things
1:35:55
were going well i was excited this is my calling for life my for my life I believe was Christian music and it was
1:36:02
you know I was like living in like a lush city in a way in that regard in that regard you know and then
1:36:10
I received this prophecy it's so exciting it's so exciting to hear this prophecy about what God is going to do
1:36:17
revival is now you know but it's not the city right after the city the the
1:36:25
lushness right after the you I had to go through the barrenness i had to go through the desert i had to go through
1:36:31
the wilderness to get to the promised land and that was my journey that God
1:36:37
took me through just like Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit
1:36:43
the Holy Spirit put that that that in the GPS put the GPS in you know put that
1:36:49
in there for his journey that he would be tested in the wilderness by the
1:36:55
devil and so that's what happened for me and all the while God is saying "Keep your spark alive keep confessing that
1:37:02
revival is now keep obeying me keep your joy protect your heart keep preaching
1:37:08
keep walking keep praising keep serving every day even though you're in the
1:37:15
wilderness even though it feels like you're going backwards keep going keep your spark alive watch me turn it into a
1:37:23
wildfire in my perfect timing all you have to do is keep your spark
1:37:30
alive hallelujah and God says "Don't despise don't despise small beginnings
1:37:35
for the Lord loves to see the work begin." It's just like when you're excited to go on a road trip you don't
1:37:42
get depressed when you're in the desert when you're in the barren land on the way there do you you get excited i'm
1:37:48
getting closer i'm on the way every second I'm getting closer to
1:37:55
the promised land that's how God wants you to be that's how God wants you to
1:38:00
live in your journey with him and so how to ignite revival in your city in your
1:38:06
nation in your workplace your family wherever is you have to keep your spark alive and you need to rest knowing that
1:38:14
there is a GPS a spiritual GPS from God that you are following and you are
1:38:20
guaranteed to reach that destination if you can put so much trust in your
1:38:25
GPS how about your trust in God amen amen hallelujah but what makes the
1:38:34
difference is when you are really in alignment with what God has
1:38:42
spoken there was someone that saw what God had done and and this person might be watching right now and and they asked
1:38:49
a question they were like "How can we have this revival in our
1:38:55
church i want this in our church
1:39:01
and the answer is you have to come in alignment with what God is doing on this
1:39:08
earth right now you have to come in alignment with this move of God this
1:39:13
revival that God has brought this move of God he has brought is for the entire body of Christ it is not for one
1:39:19
ministry but it is for all ministries it's for the whole body of Christ
1:39:26
you have you know instead of doing your own thing you have to come to the same
1:39:32
GPS destination that God has put that's where the grace is that's
1:39:38
where you have your spark and there's a supernatural edge to it there i mean God
1:39:44
is putting supernatural gasoline on it like to increase it and and and there's
1:39:50
a supernatural protection over you when you're on the journey and there's a supernatural strength and joy in the
1:39:58
wilderness that God gives to you when you're in alignment with his
1:40:03
will amen and so God is speaking to the whole body of Christ now i have brought
1:40:09
revival i have brought it stop praying for it join it
1:40:15
you need to accept my anointing god is saying my power because some people want revival
1:40:22
without the power what is that the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power you need to accept my power
1:40:31
that destroys yolks that casts out demons that heals the sick that raises the dead because the devil is out here
1:40:38
trying to steal kill and destroy young children and the elderly alike and everybody in between the devil is coming
1:40:46
and trying to kill children before their time and we need to embrace the power of God
1:40:53
to resurrect these children we need to embrace the power of God to cast demons
1:40:58
out of 19year-olds that have struggled with porn addictions for seven years and
1:41:04
they don't want to be we need to embrace this anointing that heals every kind of
1:41:09
illness and delivers every kind of person from any kind of bondage we have
1:41:16
to embrace this we can't do our own thing and how God's anointing comes is is a specific way is an order is through
1:41:23
impartation is through servants he has anointed we have to accept his servants that he has chosen he has chosen
1:41:30
servants apostles prophets evangelists apostastors and teachers in the body of
1:41:35
Christ accept his ways accept his leaders accept these five-fold ministers
1:41:42
accept the anointing that moves through them accept the prophecies the prophetic words that come through them
1:41:49
and come in alignment hallelujah
1:41:56
we have this pastor a minister from Peru she comes here humbly to receive impartation of anointing and she
1:42:02
received so powerfully and she kept receiving even more today and now revival is going to break out through
1:42:10
her in Peru in the prison and wherever she ministers
1:42:17
but it's not because she looked at this revival happening and says "I'm going to
1:42:22
do my own thing my own way and I'm going to try to copycat that and try to go viral with that or
1:42:28
something cuz it's worked for them or something like that." No she humbled
1:42:34
herself and submitted herself to God's
1:42:40
will for her life and for every child of God in the body of Christ right now to
1:42:46
join his revival she went to where the anointing is the anointing that works for you is
1:42:53
the anointing you honor celebrate and respect you can't just say "Lord give me
1:42:59
anointing all the way over here just in my room just pour upon me you need to
1:43:04
honor anointing where it is moving on this earth right now and respect it and
1:43:10
receive impartation from it this is God's way that we see from the Old
1:43:15
Testament to New Testament it's his way of releasing his power of releasing his anointing is through impartation elijah
1:43:23
to Elisha Moses to Joshua Paul to Timothy this is the Bible this is God's
1:43:29
way amen hallelujah and so revival is now
1:43:34
and God is ready to ignite spread this revival that's happening in LA that's
1:43:42
happening in other places around the world he's ready to ignite this in your city and your
1:43:47
[Music] nation but you have to do it God's
1:43:53
way so the first thing you need to do is
1:43:59
carry this spark that God has given you and stay in alignment with God's
1:44:05
will don't take Don't exit out of the maps
1:44:12
app keep the maps app up in front of you keep looking at it keep remembering that
1:44:18
without it you're lost don't get all you know relaxed
1:44:26
and chill and zealous and not in a godly way and that you just
1:44:34
or maybe you want to rush things and you're like "Oh let me try this road over here."
1:44:42
instead of following the GPS and so like what has happened in my
1:44:48
life how I've seen my little spark against all odds ignite into a massive wildfire has
1:44:55
been because of the prophetic word that I believed and
1:45:01
followed the prophetic word the word of God
1:45:07
spoken was the destination and I made sure I followed
1:45:13
that the directions to get there through humility through obedience through
1:45:20
submission through through humbling myself and hearing prophetic
1:45:26
guidance through my spiritual father through my spiritual
1:45:33
leader amen hallelujah
1:45:40
and you also cannot wait for um you cannot wait for people in the
1:45:48
world to throw gasoline on your
1:45:54
spark you have to make the choice to keep your spark alive without other
1:46:00
people's opinions and cheering you on and and joining you and saying this
1:46:07
is great what you're doing i want to be a part the world will not throw gasoline on it to make it to
1:46:14
ignite it will ignite supernaturally by God through your obedience of keeping it
1:46:21
alive through your obedience of keeping that spark alive every moment you're keeping it
1:46:27
alive you're sewing supernatural seeds that will produce a mighty
1:46:32
supernatural harvest so it doesn't seem like anything's
1:46:38
happening at first you're sewing these but you're sewing seed after seed after seed keeping your flame alive shining
1:46:44
your light doesn't seem like anything's happening you may be in a wilderness like I was maybe for years I was in this
1:46:50
wilderness doesn't seem like anything's happening in fact it feels like we're going backwards but every single moment
1:46:55
of obedience every single moment of declaring revival is now every single moment of continuing to serve God do the
1:47:02
work of God shining my light keeping the spark alive was a moment that I was sewing a seed and not just any seed but
1:47:10
a supernatural seed an anointed seed because I was in
1:47:15
the prophetic word over my life i was in the will of God so it's like the anointing was
1:47:22
coming upon every seed every seed sown it wasn't a natural seed it was a supernatural seed because
1:47:31
everybody in the so what you sew you reap is a spiritual principle that applies to everybody if if anybody in
1:47:38
the world if they work really hard they will be successful you know if if anybody in the
1:47:45
world is really disrespectful to other people they will get disrespect back if they're really respectful to people they
1:47:52
will get respect back if they're generous to people they will they will have people be generous to them it's
1:47:58
just this principle in life in the spiritual realm that's not just doesn't just apply to believers but but now when
1:48:05
you do it according to God's will when you sew these seeds it's supernatural
1:48:11
seeds that you're sewing so it's supernatural harvest
1:48:16
supernatural success supernatural abundance supernatural victory that
1:48:23
takes place hallelujah
1:48:29
hallelujah so it's your responsibility to keep your flame alive don't wait for
1:48:34
people to throw gas on it you have to keep it alive god throws
1:48:40
gas on it in his timing when that harvest comes of your seed sown amen so don't look around for
1:48:49
encouragement from people don't look around for and be discouraged if people aren't um as excited as you are and as
1:48:56
on fire as you are they are in darkness and you need to be the light you are
1:49:02
needed don't look at them and say why aren't they on fire like me god sent them to you
1:49:09
why aren't they catching the fire like like I have caught the fire you have
1:49:14
just planted a seed that will someday in timing in their own free will turn into
1:49:21
a fire in their life and they will be aided but your light that you are
1:49:26
shining is meant to be a seed right now so don't be discouraged if they're not
1:49:32
being set on fire immediately like you're set on fire you were sent to them
1:49:38
amen they are in deep darkness and you are sent to them by
1:49:43
God see yourself rightly stand tall and strong and and
1:49:48
and proud of this light of Jesus not caring what anybody says not caring what
1:49:54
anybody thinks amen
1:50:01
john 1:45 philip found Nathaniel and told him "We have found the one Moses in
1:50:06
the law and also the prophets wrote about Jesus from Nazareth the son of
1:50:12
Joseph." Nathaniel answered him "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"
1:50:18
Philip replied "Come and see."
1:50:23
So in Jesus's time there was so much opposition towards him um people didn't
1:50:30
immediately catch the fire they didn't everyone didn't
1:50:36
immediately catch it only those who were humble and pure in heart could see who
1:50:41
Jesus was and caught the fire and as they shown their light the
1:50:48
fire grew as they shared their testimonies far and wide the fire caught
1:50:53
on more and more people's eyes opened up more and more people were saying all these false
1:51:00
things about Jesus but then so the army of God rose up and shared their testimonies and those testimonies
1:51:06
overpowered all of the lies spoken about Jesus all the false accusations spoken about
1:51:12
Jesus there were false accusations there were lies and there was also skepticism
1:51:17
great skepticism jesus chose chooses to use the the foolish things to confound the
1:51:23
wisdom of this world and so Jesus was a foolish thing meaning in the fact that
1:51:29
he came from Nazareth this town that is not known to
1:51:34
have really anybody doing great impressive things is not known to have
1:51:41
great spiritual leaders come from this town of Nazareth but God had him be born
1:51:47
there because he uses the weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world to show his power to show
1:51:54
that nothing is impossible with him to show that it's him doing everything not
1:52:00
our talents giftings experience our networks where we've come from the great
1:52:07
city we've come from the heritage but it's only God amen
1:52:13
and so people this is one there was a great skepticism towards Jesus there was a lot of skepticism you know there were
1:52:19
some people that were skeptical because of the false accusations and then there were some people that were skeptical like nah this is not what we're
1:52:26
expecting i don't think this can be it they had in their mind this is what the
1:52:31
Messiah would look like this is where he would be from this is what the things he would say these are the actions he would
1:52:38
do they had it set in their mind and so certain things like this would
1:52:44
would come about where we have someone saying someone having immediate skepticism when Philillip is saying we
1:52:50
found we found the one the Messiah the one that the prophets wrote about with
1:52:56
great excitement and joy fire so so happy to share this good news and we
1:53:03
see we see Nathaniel immediately have skepticism and not catch the fire immediately and
1:53:11
say "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" So he's having great
1:53:18
skepticism because of where Jesus has come from and I've seen that whenever God moves in
1:53:26
great power whenever he chooses who he wants to choose he follows the same the
1:53:32
same blueprint of choosing weak and foolish things where people will say the
1:53:38
same thing can anything good come from Nazareth where this person that you're
1:53:43
saying God is using came from and I've seen that so much in my life in
1:53:51
this move of God with my spiritual father where I received this anointing from being from
1:54:00
Africa and there is that um stereotype wrong
1:54:05
stereotype like they had about Nazareth that some people a lot of people have
1:54:11
towards Africa can anything good come from Africa
1:54:17
and they they they they say so much witchcraft comes from Africa they they
1:54:23
paint this wrong picture of this beautiful continent
1:54:29
where true family in Christ live whom God loves just as much as he
1:54:37
loves us and whom God uses just as much as he uses and even more powerfully
1:54:43
and sometimes more than people from all over
1:54:48
other places in the world and so I've seen that so much i've seen
1:54:54
that that same exact skept skeptical scheme of the enemy can anything good
1:55:00
come from Africa this doubt the skepticism towards this move of God towards this revival it's the same
1:55:07
scheme of the enemy but those who have pure hearts like you have seen the
1:55:14
truth and just as people saw it just as Philip saw no this is really God doesn't
1:55:21
matter where he came from this is really God
1:55:26
this is how it is for you for many of you you have truly seen Jesus you have
1:55:32
truly seen the light you have truly seen Jesus moving in power and you don't care
1:55:39
where the anointing came from who imparted it where he came
1:55:44
from glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and so the Lord was speaking to me about
1:55:51
this he said these these pe my children these my children that are in this army
1:55:56
of God right now they are like Phillip they are like Philillip carrying
1:56:04
this great light and saying we have found we have found the light we have
1:56:10
found revival we have found what we've been searching for our whole lives
1:56:20
and and then there's many people out there in the world that are like Nathaniel what good can come from from
1:56:27
Nazareth i don't believe you even though your the fruits are there in the joy and
1:56:33
the abundant life and the freedom that your life has now there will be skeptics out there that will say "What good can
1:56:40
come from Nazareth type things to you?" But what did Philip say what did Philip do he didn't cower down he didn't
1:56:47
retreat he didn't um get discouraged he didn't second guessess but he said "Come
1:56:54
and see he stood his ground he kept shining his light he He took his place in the
1:57:02
revival army and and and was adamant i know what I know i've seen I I know what
1:57:09
I've seen and you can't tell me otherwise and I want you to be a part of this too."
1:57:15
There is this fire in Philillip and there's this fire that God has imparted to you to be his messenger to spread his
1:57:24
light everywhere you go no matter what people say no matter what the skepticism you get comes your way amen
1:57:33
hallelujah so this is how you keep your flame alive you stay strong in the face
1:57:40
of the naysayers and the critics you don't let that distinguish your light at
1:57:46
all amen
1:57:52
isaiah 9:2 "The people who walk in spiritual darkness will see a great light those
1:58:00
who live in the dark land the light will shine on them you oh God will increase
1:58:06
the nation you will multiply their joy they will rejoice before you like the joy and jubilation of the harvest as men
1:58:13
rejoice when they divide the spoil of victory for you will break the yoke of Israel's burden and the staff on their
1:58:20
shoulders the rod of their oppressor as of the battle of Midian i'm going to read this uh in the the Passion
1:58:27
translation right now and this word is so powerful this word is a prophetic word of now of what God has done and
1:58:34
what he is doing now hallelujah those who walked in darkness have seen a
1:58:41
radiant light shining upon them this is you and this is about to be so many more
1:58:48
people who are currently living in darkness and you are going to be that
1:58:54
light that extends to them because this revival started as a spark jean Tall saw
1:59:02
that spark at first it was just
1:59:08
her it was like a little light that not many people could see and then she joined that spark and
1:59:16
it became a bigger spark and then eventually more people
1:59:22
could see that light cuz it was bigger and then it grew and it grew and
1:59:28
it grew and there's 20some or more maybe 20 to 30 of you raise your hand if you've been here since 2021
1:59:35
2021 2021 when revival first broke out 2021
1:59:40
look at all these hands this is just like 15 10 15 something like
1:59:46
this you caught the fire you saw the light you were living in darkness and you saw this light
1:59:56
and then raise your hand if you've been here since 2022
2:00:02
if put your hands down if you came in 2021 just the ones that came in
2:00:09
2022 and then that's more hands and then this light became bigger put your hands down 2023 if you came here in 2023
2:00:17
way more hands and then this light extended the light became bigger so now
2:00:22
you in the dark land could see this light but it was because now from if you
2:00:28
came in 2024 raise your hands and now the light became bigger so you
2:00:34
could see this light okay if you came in 2025 raise your hands
2:00:41
25 and that's all of all hallelujah so now if you didn't come in

2:00:57
24 21 to 24 okay all those people that came in 2025 they saw this greater light and
2:01:06
were able to come were able to see this light but you can put them your hands down because all of you made this light
2:01:13
become bigger how powerful you are in Christ
2:01:19
how much powerful more powerful we are when we unite together
2:01:25
how great this light is amen amen

2:01:55
and they joined us in in becoming the light of the world they joined us in becoming this fire and we
2:02:03

2:02:09
God because of this multiplication of light we have been given overwhelming
2:02:15
[Applause] joy hallelujah
2:02:24

2:02:31
of what God has done here in this scripture that is a now scripture now you walked in darkness you saw the
2:02:38
radiant light you were once living in the shadows of death but now a glorious light of revival has dawned of this

2:03:31
that Pharisees try to put around us and try to hinder the move of God from
2:03:36
spreading you have broken the chains that abound your people that abound your

army in this revival hallelujah woo
2:03:51
and you have lifted off the heavy bar across their shoulders you have lifted
2:03:57
off the heaviness of persecution and you have turned what the enemy meant for evil for our good you
2:04:05
have opened our eyes to see that anything you allow is for our good
2:04:12
and the persecution that you allowed God the persecution that the devil brought as a heavy bar has turned into a
2:04:19
refining fire that has made us more transformed into your image that has
2:04:25
opened up our spiritual eyes to see the goodness of you to allow this refining
2:04:30
fire and this brings us an overwhelming and ecstatic joy and
2:04:38
rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah
2:04:43
[Applause] for you have broken the chains that have
2:04:49
bound your people and lifted off the heavy bar from across their shoulders the rod the oppressor the oppressor of
2:04:55
the Pharisees the rod the oppressor used against them he has lifted it off
2:05:02
and he has given us great joy and great victory and more fire for him
2:05:10

2:05:18
depression all the anxiety all the suicidal thoughts all the ways the devil
2:05:23

2:05:29
poverty you have shattered the bondage of the religious spirit that kept you from knowing the love of
2:05:35
God you have shattered it hallelujah
2:05:41
woo just as you did when Midian's armies were defeated just like he did it just
2:05:47
like he did it for Gideon's army just like he did it for Moses against Pharaoh
2:05:52
and and the Egyptians just like he did for Joshua in
2:05:57
in in Jericho just like he did for Jesus as he rose from the grave
2:06:04
just like he did for all of the apostles all that have gone before us he has done it for us again
2:06:12
hallelujah woo thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
2:06:19
this joy he has given us is just the beginning because it's the multiplication of the light it's the
2:06:24
multiplication of testimonies the multiplication of miracles the multiplication of people coming into the
2:06:30
kingdom this is what brings us the most joy because this is what brings the father the most joy this is what brings
2:06:36
God the most joy is when his kingdom advances is when the lost are saved

2:07:24
will keep on increasing hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
2:07:31
[Applause] hallelujah
2:07:38
hallelujah thank you Jesus daniel it was prophetic that Daniel shared his testimony today
2:07:46
because of the word that the Lord led me to share this is a prophetic word proverbs 24:16 for a righteous man
2:07:53
listen to this a righteous man or woman falls seven times and rises
2:08:02
again [Applause] but the wicked stumble in time of
2:08:07
disaster and collapse i'm going to read this in the Passion translation for the lovers of God the true lovers of God not
2:08:15
the religious hypocrites that live in
2:08:22
lukewarmness for the lovers the true lovers of God with pure hearts that
2:08:28
truly with all their hearts all they want to do is please God the true lovers of God may suffer adversity
2:08:35
they may suffer adversity because the enemy hates them more than he hates anybody else he tries harder on them
2:08:41
than he tries on anybody else when he hears when he hears a prophetic word over their life he attacks them more
2:08:46
than he's ever attacked them in their life because he's terrified of your
2:08:51
destination as you follow the GPS the spiritual GPS from God he's terrified
2:08:58
because he's smart enough to know he's been around a while and he knows about David's in the field what they turn out
2:09:03
to be he knows about Abram who will be obedient to God and go to another land
2:09:10
and sacrifice everything and they turn out to be Abrahams
2:09:16
he knows about Moses's he know he knows them when he recognizes them when those
2:09:22
words are spoken over your life he doesn't want it to happen again like it happened with David like it happened
2:09:28
with all the leaders faith leaders in the Bible and so the lovers of God may
2:09:33
suffer adversity because the devil is terrified of you and they may stumble
2:09:38
seven times they may stumble because we are growing we're not perfect
2:09:47
we are tested but it's okay if you p don't pass the test once in a while god gives it to you again and he cheers you
2:09:54
on and he gives you what you need to pass it the next time he doesn't throw you out because you
2:10:01
failed one test he says "Get up." The righteous man
2:10:06
falls down seven times but gets rises again rise up
2:10:15
you are not called to perfection you are not called to be perfect you are called to have a heart after
2:10:21
God's sometimes having a heart after God's sometimes it means you still have make a mistake once in a while and God
2:10:28
allow God that can happen because God wants to humble you
2:10:34
so don't be hard on yourself don't beat yourself up if you make a mistake god is counting on you to rise to continually
2:10:41
rise if you have fallen down he's saying rise my son my daughter don't stay there
2:10:48
he doesn't push you down when you're down he doesn't throw you away when you're down he lifts out his hand and
2:10:53
pulls you up grab his hand don't reject his hand pulling you
2:11:00
up and I speak this prophetically i speak this prophetically cuz I remember
2:11:06
last year a powerful word came upon your life Daniel powerful word and the devil
2:11:11
was terrified so I'm speaking this prophetically to you all this word that has been released
2:11:17
over you all how you are leaders in this revival that you are so powerful in
2:11:23
Christ you need to be prepared for spiritual warfare you need to be prepared that the enemy is not happy
2:11:29
about that word the enemy is not happy about what God just did the enemy is not
2:11:34
happy about the splitting of the sea so just be prepared don't worry but just be
2:11:40
prepared just be prepared and if you ever your your faith will be tested it's
2:11:45
okay for your faith to be tested that's the only way your faith grows is when it's tested
2:11:51
there will be challenges of your faith and so if you don't get it perfect if
2:11:56
you don't get it perfect every time if you fall down one time or seven times it's no big deal
2:12:03
because many times a lot of you make mistakes but you didn't do it out of evil intentions it was genuinely a
2:12:08
mistake genuinely so don't let the devil lie to you see
2:12:15
God's hand lifting you up grab his hand accept his hand and rise again
2:12:29
hallelujah peter denied Jesus for a time peter denied Jesus for some days he
2:12:35
denied He completely denied Jesus he made a mistake big time that's a big big
2:12:41
big mistake and he was called to be a leader and so he fell down but he rose again he didn't let the devil lie to him
2:12:48
and say "Oh you shouldn't be a leader now you shouldn't even be a disciple anymore look how bad you failed how
2:12:53
could you do this you denied Jesus not one time but three times you weren't there with him when he was up on the
2:12:58
cross he rejected the devil's lies which those those lies of the devil were for sure there those lies of condemnation
2:13:05
were for sure there he rejected every single one of those lies and he was able to rise again and
2:13:12
today we are blessed by him rising we are blessed he's blessed the body of
2:13:17
Christ for eternity he stood strong and laid a foundation in the body of Christ
2:13:24
and put out an example for us to follow today and so if you fall ever you need to rise
2:13:32
again like Peter rose amen you need to be prepared to not hear the devil's lies
2:13:37
to not listen to them to not give them a moment don't look at other people and compare yourself and you don't know
2:13:44
what's happening in their lives and the devil attacks people at different times and the more powerful you are in Christ
2:13:50
the more he's going to try to stop you but you will always have victory
2:13:55
so don't compare yourself and say "I don't think I'm Look they have a more beautiful heart for God than me look
2:14:00
they shine more." Stop it that's the devil's lies god's counting on you to
2:14:05
continually rise and continually shine for him
2:14:14
that's all you need to keep focusing on that's all you got to focus on is keep rising and shining keep that light alive
2:14:20
don't let it go out amen hallelujah
2:14:27
