58:23
God is going to move through the screen in power I believe that it it's going to
58:28
be a greater glory today God is a God who takes us glory to glory We go higher
58:34
and higher Faith upon faith glory upon glory power upon power
58:39
The more faith the more God can do And I remember I remember last year's Flourish
58:45
Conference a year exactly a year ago from now and what God did at the
58:51
Flourish Conference infused so much faith in people that they didn't have
58:56
before And it was this crescendo of faith that led to God doing miracles
59:03
that were so shocking the the most shocking on at Sunday service that
59:09
weekend And so I believe God is going to do the same thing today where this this
59:15
increase of faith this increase of surrender this increase of hunger and
59:21
fire for God to receive all he has for us has come to all of you And so I
59:29
believe with all of my heart that God is going to do miracles that many of you have dreamed for prayed for for many
59:36
years I believe we're going to see God do new miracles today we've never seen before I believe we're going to see
59:42
people healed of all kinds of diseases The lame will walk I believe
59:48
blind eyes will open I believe deaf ears will open I believe resurrection life
59:53
will come If there is anyone that needs to be risen from the dead through the screen I
59:59
believe he's going to raise you from the dead through the screen and even in the future if someone dies
1:00:05
that they would play this live stream of today and be risen from the dead because God's power is
1:00:12
here and the recipe for miracles is God's power and
1:00:19
faith and that is here so powerfully today
1:00:25
Amen Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:00:30
[Applause] Hallelujah Thank you Jesus Today is the
1:00:36
day Today is the day God will be glorified like never before I believe
1:00:42
it'll be a greater glory like we've never seen today Hallelujah

1:00:55

1:04:06
My name is Barbara I'm from Germany I'm a pastor in Germany And I had a like a
1:04:13
burnout 2023 in February I took a time alone with the Lord And in that time
1:04:20
alone with him in my closet I found you and have been praying to see the power
1:04:28
of God for so many years They said "Lord finally I find what I was looking
1:04:34
for." And I came home and I took my husband and I told him what I found and
1:04:40
we came to Prague and the Lord broke off of me This whole um down feeling like
1:04:46
depression and like burnout feeling I came home with new
1:04:52
fire and I I said in our church we are just small
1:04:58
but we need this fire I shared your video just a short clip and persecution
1:05:04
started to erupt in our church They said um they don't believe that this is real
1:05:10
They have seen these videos that were made about you They said that's not good That's from the devil and then I'm from
1:05:17
the devil because I'm under you So I had a really hard time in my own church and
1:05:24
the people that were criticizing that they left the church So we had a split in the church and my husband who's
1:05:31
pastoring with me he said "Please stop watching Please stop sharing We will have a big problem if you continue." So
1:05:39
I had a choice to make and I said "Lord I found what I've been looking for."
1:05:55
So I continue to watch I continue to watch but secretly I got planted in
1:06:03
September last year secretly and I got enrolled in the E course secretly and
1:06:09
then Arise and Shine came up I said "Lord I want to go but I can't because we have this situation at home." And I
1:06:16
had been sick with the flu for three weeks So I felt weak I felt like under a
1:06:22
clock of fear and intimidation but I wanted to come So the
1:06:29
Lord said "Share your testimony." I shared my testimony With sharing my testimony the heavens broke open
1:06:47
because in the comments many people commented One of them was Laura from Germany
1:06:53
and I knew her from her testimony So the testimony was the way for me to come and
1:07:00
I said Laura I would love to come but I have no no money I am sick and I am
1:07:06
under this situation And she said "You have to come." I said "I will come." So I said "Lord you have to make
1:07:13
a way." He provided for the finances He provided for the flight He provided for accommodation And he opened my husband's
1:07:21
heart to allow me to come with his [Applause]
1:07:28
blessing So I'm here and he has blessed me also to come and he is not uh angry
1:07:35
that I'm here And then we two days ago we were waiting in the line for two hours to come in and I start to feel
1:07:42
sick again And then I start to say yesterday get behind me Satan I just
1:07:47
learned that And in the session yesterday I got
1:07:54
completely healed Yes Yes And this fear has broken from me
1:08:01
The fear of men or fear of persecution as you taught us
1:08:09
Amen I want to thank you so much that I can be planted under you and I can
1:08:15

1:10:08
hi hun Thank you for sharing Come on Come on in here So I know some people have heard your testimony but not
1:10:14
everyone Prior to Arise and Shine what God did Do you want to share and then you can share what God did at Arise and
1:10:21
Shine yeah Um so for a long time since I was like 12 to eight I suffered with um
1:10:30
depression and always wanting to kill myself or kill other people And I've
1:10:36
never loved people at all I've always had like a hatred and if someone were to
1:10:43
like make me mad or I were to stub my toe on something immediately like
1:10:48
demonic thoughts would come in my head and it would be like oh kill them gut
1:10:53
them out and like um kill myself or jump out of the window and I would always um
1:11:00
go into the room I would either cut myself or bang my head and it would my
1:11:06
head would be like so swollen and I was like I was 145 lbs but
1:11:13
my head like looked like I was like 200 lb cuz I would always like bang it and
1:11:19
hit it on like the door like go in the bathroom and punch myself And I just
1:11:25
like was never free And then one day my mom she saw like a Spanish video not
1:11:30
even an English video of Apostle in her room And I saw like a shift in my mom
1:11:36
and I wanted what I wanted what my mom had and she had shared her testimony and
1:11:42
I had went up to her room after and she finally showed me what it was and I
1:11:48
threw away all my collections like that were worth like hundreds to thousands of dollars of like BTS of um things I
1:11:56
idolized more than God cuz for a young age I just never believed in God even though I was Pentecostal soul Um I saw
1:12:04
people touched by the power of God but never how I saw at your church And so
1:12:10
when I had got free of that we had finally decided to come cuz we didn't know you were in LA We thought you were
1:12:16
in like New York or something And then um when we found that out we wanted to come and my sister was the first one to
1:12:23
get prayed for And after that I had finally been delivered of everything I
1:12:30
haven't suffered from demonic depression at
1:12:35
all And yeah so all the thoughts went away
1:12:43
and I I have never like thought about hurting someone else I haven't And there
1:12:50
would be like spurges of anger but with your teachings I just like reject them and like they like they go They had to
1:12:57
go So they're not coming [Applause] back and there your teachings your
1:13:05
teachings were very easy for me to catch on to So even when I was 16 and I came I
1:13:12
understood very quick and my little sister did too She was nine and we
1:13:17
immediately knew to reject like the evil thoughts So when we went to um we had
1:13:23
went to flourish and these like I had were I was suffering of more demonic
1:13:29
oppression at that time of um evil names that I didn't know about like um like
1:13:36
ball or all I didn't know who that was at all and it they were just coming I couldn't sleep My mom was having like
1:13:43
sing to me at Flourish I was delivered of that I never thought about it And
1:13:49
then at this time at a rise and shine conference I was so expectant And this
1:13:55
week I was like hoing the garden um cuz it was like very big And I hurt my
1:14:02
should my collar bone and I had went to go pay for my mom to get nails done And
1:14:08
you know how they have massage chairs it I was like crying out in pain like when the massage chairs were like touching it
1:14:15
touching my back I had a rise and shine when you said at
1:14:20
the last session "Grab your miracle." I grabbed it and I couldn't move my
1:14:27
shoulder I knew and yeah I
1:14:33
just now I could like it doesn't hurt anymore And I want this for my whole
1:14:40

1:15:06
reason that people come to Jesus and are saved and are free And just like you saw
1:15:12

1:15:19
I call your schoolmates the people in school to be attracted to you and ask you questions and find Jesus through you
1:15:27

want to thank God for this moment and I want to thank you for your pure heart
1:22:22
Um as you said uh pure hearts are very
1:22:27
rare In 2006 I decide to move to United States Um I was living in a small town
1:22:34
very poor town where I grew up with my parents and I always want since I was a
1:22:40
kid I wanted to help my parents So I moved to United States and then um same
1:22:46
year my my older brother he started drinking alcohol very bad
1:22:52
So somebody told my my mom that there were some spiritual doctors that they
1:22:58
will help my brother So I told my mom yes we want to help him And then uh
1:23:04
there were u workers from the devil witches So I
1:23:11
started sending thousands of dollars thousands of dollars for them And my
1:23:17
brother brother was getting worse He couldn't stay in some jobs He was
1:23:22
getting fired And then uh he came to United States in
1:23:28
2008 And then I noticed something that on when he was on the way here I broke
1:23:34
my ankle It it I've been going through like a lot of things So
1:23:39
um and then uh in 2016 or 18 I think I started following a
1:23:47
pastor that he is in Houston He's the one who invited you to revival is now
1:23:53
Houston His name is uh Hermia Maldonado Jeremiah Maldonado Um he prophesied something
1:24:00
over my country and then I started follow him just curious if the prophecy will come through
1:24:07
Um and then in 2022 um my son was um diagnosed with
1:24:16
autism So in that year I I was depressed I was with so much anxiety suicidal
1:24:24
thoughts and then I I told God what happened what you know what I'm
1:24:31
going through this and then I talked to these people who I was paying thousands
1:24:36
of dollar I told him you know what next year I'm not paying you anymore my my my
1:24:42
brother he's worst you you're talking about um um pro I gonna prosper and I'm worst
1:24:49
so what's what's was what's what's going on And they were like "No no no We got to do this then." And they um in 2018 I
1:24:56
think they sent me like uh candles a yearly nasty water that so I can take a
1:25:05
bath with Um so uh yeah my my brother he was in
1:25:13
2022 to you know been drinking so much So no
1:25:20
Um and then in 2022 so I I I told God you know what when this going
1:25:27
to end so and and then um I started to doing some rituals too I I was
1:25:35
depressed I got I was desperate for money And then I started watching some videos on YouTube from a guy that's from
1:25:42
Spain He's a satanic cult leader So I was talking with him I was texting and
1:25:49
then he was telling me what to do so I can come in the ordinary and then I was
1:25:55
doing rituals with the money and then um I bought a book on Amazon from him and
1:26:00
just it it was a it was kind of rare because just repeating things repeating things and doing little rituals on on
1:26:07
the mirror things like that So and then in in the beginning of 20 23 I I I told
1:26:15
my my girlfriend uh my future uh wife we're going to get married in like three
1:26:21
weeks Um I told her you know we're going to start a business and and she's like
1:26:28
"Yes." And I started spending all the money all the money that we had um her money my son's savings all I spent all
1:26:36
the money And I didn't know that was demonic So when I realized that I was demonp possessed
1:26:44
um I knew that I went very very deep in
1:26:49
demonic things So yeah So I went to four different churches in Maryland looking
1:26:56
for deliverance And then the day that I I decide to to break the curse I grab
1:27:04
the the yearly the everything that they send me I put in a
1:27:09
dumpster So I went to different churches and then nothing But uh but and then at
1:27:17
the same time I was watching the videos from this pastor in Houston live on Facebook And then is when one day he I
1:27:25
was trying to talk to him I was trying to go to his church I knew that he he's
1:27:30
he's used by God powerfully to thank God And then one day he posted your picture
1:27:35
saying revival is now Houston And that's how I came across with you And then um I
1:27:42
remember that day I remember that day And then um I still was trying to talk to him and and I make phone calls send
1:27:48
emails nothing So I was like "Okay I'm going through this ministry." And then um I found you on Facebook and sadly the
1:27:57
first persons that I found was scammers So they were like saw a seed here We can
1:28:05
see prophetic that things like that was like this going to be it But finally I
1:28:10
found the the email and I sent the email and then 4 days later I got respond and
1:28:16
then uh it was July July 2023 that when
1:28:22
you pray for me it was amazing and then uh since that I I I started uh watching
1:28:31
your your your videos applying what you teach on your videos and then uh my son
1:28:38
is is different Yeah my son is different He's
1:28:45
shining I had a a card from from school saying that he's shining He's trying to
1:28:51
put sentences together When I tell him um his name Ethan when I tell him Ethan
1:28:58
it's time to sleep Let's go brush teeth He turn his TV off and we go to brush
1:29:04
teeth And it is amazing that the other day I grabbed the remote I had the
1:29:10
remote on on my hand and he was like "Hallelujah Hallelujah." Pointing the TV because he hurts when I
1:29:18
say allelujah When you say allelujah he heard that Hey Yeah And then um on
1:29:25
Friday when I when I was landing to the airport the the the plane was landing on
1:29:30
I started feeling like a sharp pain on my heart very and I was like this fear
1:29:35
or this sharp and it's been attacking me that way because I have I have been declaring that as you say we have um
1:29:43
heaven in our heart and then I I I know that it it's demon it was demonic but on

1:31:05
delivered you powerfully I'm so blessed to be here I'm so blessed to be here Apostle I've been
1:31:11
watching for only a couple of months and he has changed my life so much
1:31:19
This is the first time being here in LA This is the first time being in this church Wow I just need to breathe
1:31:28
Wow So I'm going to let tell a little bit about my life Um because my life has
1:31:35
been very much I think demonic spiritually bonds from the beginning
1:31:41
actually from when I was a kid because my father had a mental illness uh that
1:31:46
made him go into psychosis which made him go into another kind of reality So I
1:31:53
he he he went into these stages and I remember just being very afraid of him
1:31:59
like very afraid of him all the time And when he was in this psychosis he could
1:32:04
say that he was Jesus He said that he could fly He said that he could go
1:32:09
through walls It was very scary And I witnessed
1:32:14
I my mother didn't left him My mother didn't leave him So I was in that house
1:32:20
for many years from I was when I was born He wanted to throw himself out the
1:32:26
window because he thought he could fly because he thought he was Jesus or
1:32:31
something And I was just a newborn baby So and I I feel like I feel like my
1:32:38
mother just stayed there with him uh to protect the family or something
1:32:44
So in my life I had struggled from from my whole life with anxiety with thoughts
1:32:50
of death like you should kill yourself You're ugly You're not worthy It's the
1:32:55
enemy I know now but I didn't know then I just learned that now So I'm so
1:33:07
grateful I know that it's not me I know that it's not Jesus It's not God I know
1:33:13
that I'm God's I know that I belong to Jesus I know that my heart belongs to him So
1:33:20
now I can now I can tell these thoughts because I've had them for 20 years right i'm tw I'm 35 now and I've had them all
1:33:27
my life You're ugly You're worthless Paranoid thoughts that people hate me when I go into a room right
1:33:37
uh we love you Raise your hand Stand up if you love her
1:33:45
Stand
1:33:52
up We love you and we are your family We
1:33:57
are your family and and you are beautiful inside and outside And that's what we think
1:34:03
about you We think you are perfectly and beautifully made
1:34:11
And uh and then my life just kept going like very confused right because I had
1:34:16
influences from the enemy constantly in my mind and in my body So I did very
1:34:21
strange things I put myself in um dangerous situations with men for
1:34:27
example So I got raped and I have had sexual abuse and in my life So and I was
1:34:36
okay So when I was 20 I was walking I was feeling it so bad like when I like I
1:34:43
always did And then I heard a voice that was with I was walking on the field So
1:34:49
and it was actually a church nearby and I heard a voice that was inside of me and outside of me that said that I am
1:34:56
not alone And I knew that it was God [Applause]
1:35:07
Yes So okay Sorry I'm talking too long So h I I found this church a couple of
1:35:13
months ago and I started to listen to your teachings and I my eyes opened up
1:35:19
to that there is the spiritual realm and I got so much wisdom and I couldn't stop listening to your
1:35:26
videos I couldn't stop and I can't stop I just want to learn right
1:35:33
because I know that I've been I've been confused and I just want to learn like give me knowledge I just want to learn
1:35:40
So and then I want to apply the knowledge So so I can help other people right
1:35:46
and so it's so helpful this that you do with your online teachings So I have
1:35:51
been listening since February and I have learned so much like I cannot describe
1:35:57
And then yesterday when or I I think it was two days ago you called me up on stage and I couldn't see anything I
1:36:04
couldn't see your face I couldn't hear what you were saying I just felt the power knocking me back and I knew that
1:36:09
it was Jesus I knew that he was healing me And then I came back to my hotel in the
1:36:16
night and the enemy was just like you're not free You nothing happened He was
1:36:21
there again And I knew that this is not from God and I I can apply the teachings
1:36:27
that I've learned Right so it was really like what
1:36:34
happened yesterday uh or two days ago It was really like I know that God touched
1:36:39
me and he really opened my eyes to now you have to work like now it's starting right like now you have to apply what
1:36:46
you have learned Yes Amen Right Praise God Praise God Hallelujah

Hi I I'm Kirsty Um I'm from or I'm originally from the Marshall Islands but
1:51:29
um I'm located at Iowa Debuke Iowa Um my testimony is um I had a dream It was
1:51:35
this was last year Um I had a dream where um I was in a like a decent
1:51:41
gathering It was like a royalty gathering For some reason I was in a table full of uh people with decent
1:51:46
titles And the chair that I was sitting in it was like I knew the men before me
1:51:51
were great warriors great men So I sat on the chair and across me was a man the humblest man I ever you know talked to
1:51:58
in a dream And he said to me "What do you want to be?" And I said "Warrior." And upon coming upon uh before becoming
1:52:05
uh um God one of God's cho soldiers I actually found my mom Amy Watuk If you
1:52:13
guys didn't know she's a she's the princess of the islands She dropped her title to become God's soldier
1:52:28
She such a humble humble person because how could she have like she's a princess
1:52:33
but she dropped her title just to do God's will and you know
1:52:38
um after having that dream I didn't know what it meant but I came across her and the group that she held was called
1:52:45
Warriors and it's still called Warriors the little the little warriors of God and She actually introduced me Well I
1:52:52
actually saw you years ago your videos years ago on YouTube And I was like still skeptical Like even years after I
1:52:58
was still skeptical as she introduced you to me I was like she was interested I was like cuz I was full of old wine or
1:53:05
religious ways Like I was born and raised through Catholic So um I've been to like different churches different
1:53:11
ministry one ministry and probably four churches And I was like uh a few months
1:53:17
back I was still complaining in my heart I was like "Lord why'd you bring me all the way through all these churches?"
1:53:24
Because now I'm literally like skeptical about you And then this was in Dallas
1:53:29
This was in Dallas I was in Dallas in the front And then you know like the
1:53:35
instrumental where you were uh imparting the anointing to everyone I was still like my heart was still hardening at
1:53:41
that time But I wanted to s surrender but for some reason I couldn't because I was too skeptical I was
1:53:47
like and then uh sorry and uh before coming here I was
1:53:54
like my mom would you know encourage me seek God out seek God out leave those
1:54:00
chores out leave everything out and you know empty yourself out before you go
1:54:06
before you go to receive more And I was like okay Lord but I was still you know with the anxiety that you declared over
1:54:13
me Praise God After you declared those yolks out of me I felt light Light I
1:54:20
couldn't felt this in any ministries or churches I felt just completely light
1:54:25
and peace And um sorry I'm trying to rewind to where I stopped at Uh so
1:54:32
Dallas yes After Dallas I was like "Oh empty yourself out." I I really saw God
1:54:37
like I was like "Lord please empty me out." I was still doing chores like in the kitchen doing chores but I was like
1:54:42
"Lord don't stop emptying me out Don't stop having me draw close to you." And
1:54:49
uh coming here actually on the 18th that you that's when I came up came up to the
1:54:55
stage at the other theater Um I was surrendered I was like in the in the
1:55:02
crowds I don't know who helped my hands to bring me to the front but that hand
1:55:08
as I surrendered I don't know who that humble man was or young man was but the
1:55:13
the way he held my hands I could I could already feel God's love I was like what is this wow I was like what a hopefully
1:55:21
I was in the crowd like I'm so small I'm regian by the way So micronians not all of them are short but most of them are
1:55:28
short of course Um but um but the way he held my hand and you said bring her
1:55:34
bring her up here as you declared all those stuff out of me They went out and then peace light hovered over me I
1:55:42
couldn't I I had to stop crying because it was out So
1:55:48
yes sorry And my prayer is like lately like I've had faith before like I've
1:55:54
been a Christian my whole life Born and raised Christian Why call me Christian i call myself Christian back then just
1:56:00
because you know I was in I was with within a Christian household And you
1:56:05
know the the dream that really stand out to me is the one that the man actually
1:56:11
asked me what do you want to be i said warrior Another one this was in the this was in the past but it was like I was
1:56:19
there was a scroll and the scroll represents the Bible God's word And I
1:56:24
was in that scroll rolling around like a little baby And then like the voice said and I knew it was God The voice said
1:56:31
"Roll yourself up Roll yourself up in that scroll for the for the enemy
1:56:37
roams around seeking whom may devour." Yes And my prayer is number

morning as the new day was dawning Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb Suddenly there was a
1:58:26
great earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven rolled aside the stone and sat on it The guard shook
1:58:33
with fear when they saw him and they fell into a dead faint Then the angel spoke to the women "Don't be afraid," he
1:58:39
said "I know you are looking for Jesus who is crucified He isn't here He is risen from the dead."
1:58:46
[Applause] Hallelujah He isn't here He has risen from the dead just as he said would
1:58:53

Hallelujah Hallelujah And it's so prophetic that the Arise and Shine
1:59:13
conference was the weekend of the when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus
1:59:19
He has risen and now he's calling us to rise with him He is r He has risen and
1:59:27
he is rising in his revival right now And he's calling us to rise with him
1:59:33
because he chooses to use us So he is calling all of you to rise with him and
1:59:40
shine his light never before
1:59:45
Amen Now in this revival God is getting ready to shine like never before To show
1:59:52
himself to prove himself to open up eyes and to move in mighty signs and wonders
1:59:59
and miracles all over the world like we have never seen It's the year of
2:00:05
acceptance everybody Hallelujah I was sharing with my
2:00:12
spiritual father Prophet Joe Davyy um yesterday Um well actually before I
2:00:17
share this I want to say first of all if you didn't hear this actually you didn't hear this Many of you watching online
2:00:22
haven't heard this So I'm going to repeat something that God revealed to me so powerfully Um yesterday God had
2:00:30
spoken that at a rise and shine there was going to be a splitting of the sea that he was doing He was going to split
2:00:37
the sea for this move of God for 5F church Um and what the meaning of that
2:00:45
of course is is is showing a great wonder Hallelujah but also making a
2:00:51
way opening the door to to to to go past the enemies chasing after
2:00:59
us to go forward to overcome to escape the enemies to escape the enemy's traps
2:01:06
Amen Hallelujah And so in the past like month and a half or so the enemy has
2:01:14
really gotten angry as soon as certain doors were opened up for this move of God for this revival for this message of
2:01:21
freedom and his power and revival to get out to the world in new places The enemy
2:01:27
was angry Enemy started using people to speak lies to speak false accusations to bring persecution to try to hinder or
2:01:35
stop this move of God But the devil is always defeated He is always under our
2:01:40
feet And Jesus always has the victory And nothing can stop the work of God
2:01:48
Amen Nothing can stop the work of God
2:01:53
Nothing can stop God's plans Nothing can stop his revival Nothing can stop our
2:02:00
Jesus And when we stand with Jesus that means that we are on the winning team And that
2:02:06
means that we cannot be stopped either
2:02:13
Hallelujah Hallelujah Because God is with us And greater is he who is in us than he who is in the world trying to
2:02:20
come against us Amen And so um you know the scheme of the
2:02:27
enemy with persecution what he did in the times of Jesus what he did with all the prophets and apostles the scheme is
2:02:34
to try to get people to not accept the message accept the gospel message accept
2:02:41
the new wine Is to try to hinder people from coming and receiving Is to try to hinder people
2:02:48
from coming and entering into the kingdom of heaven is to try to keep people from receiving the keys of the
2:02:53
kingdom of heaven that unlock their freedom and their healing and abundant life and
2:02:59
salvation That is the enemy's scheme And so the so he tries to hold back people He tries to blind people from seeing the
2:03:07
light and coming and being a part and receiving and in turn being powerful
2:03:13
vessels of God being part of the army of God That's what the enemy tries So what so how so how he tries to accomplish
2:03:20
this the enemy is by sending lies is by sending false accusations is by bringing fear and intimid trying to bring fear
2:03:27
and intimidation don't go there don't go and receive there don't be a part of that
2:03:33
that's what the enemy tries to do um and so that is what the enemy we are seeing
2:03:38
the enemy try to do that as he always does he he's constantly trying to do this people are constantly trying to do
2:03:43
this for any work of God and any anointed servant of God there is always it's like it's constant It's it's just
2:03:50
life when you are anointed but it's a life of constant victory
2:03:56
We are warriors of God We are not spectators We're not citizens but we are in the we are enlisted in the army of
2:04:02
God And so we have a job to do every day Warriors every day but having victory
2:04:08
and conquering every single day Hallelujah So um so so so a meaning of the
2:04:16
splitting of the sea is really God showing himself God opening up eyes God
2:04:23
revealing that it is him It is him in his revival His re this
2:04:29
revival is God's move the power of God that is seen so
2:04:34
mightily so wildly like we've seen today already that it's really Jesus
2:04:43
God is proving this God is showing up and showing himself this The testimonies
2:04:49
that are heard the freedom the healing he is showing he is proving that this is
2:04:54
really him Amen And so
2:05:01
um when Thomas and his wife I don't know if they're here today but when Thomas and his wife from Illinois they're aged
2:05:07
75 and 77 during the uh Q&A session the very
2:05:13
first session he was the last person to ask a question He asked the question He said first of all he said I want to say
2:05:19
something I have waited 75 years for this
2:05:24
for revival And he said "My wife has been waiting longer 77 years she has waited for
2:05:32
this." They have prayed and waited for revival and it is here And he said it
2:05:38
with such gratitude and passion and awe of God And he then said,"I want to know
2:05:45
at my age how can I better be something like how can I be a better vessel of God to lead others to lead younger people
2:05:52
and and of all ages?" Um and so then as
2:05:59
he spoke that all of a sudden the Lord gave me this
2:06:05
this word The moment he said this he revealed this to me This is the
2:06:11
splitting of the sea moment right now Well like at a rise and shine it has
2:06:17
happened The Lord revealed something He revealed to me in this moment that first of all he revealed to
2:06:24
me just as he stands here and proclaims this and testifies this gentleman and
2:06:30
his wife just as they stand in God's army just stand there just show up and
2:06:37
take your place in God's revival army Something so powerful is taking
2:06:46
place And this isn't just the two of them It's it was everyone who has come Everyone who has come to this conference
2:06:53
Everyone who has come rising up taking their place in God's revival army full
2:06:58
of fire like supernaturally like like angels like an
2:07:03
angel army how they are supernatural filled with heaven angels
2:07:09
are right and so just as you all stand with the fire of the Holy Spirit
2:07:16
it's like you're angels almost you know it's like heaven on earth you're full of the you're not just people uh a group a
2:07:23
club an organization like you carry the fire of the Holy Spirit and you are a
2:07:30
true warrior of God and heaven is seen in you And we are an army together We
2:07:39
are God's army He's filled us on fire for a purpose to be in his army Not to
2:07:46
be just an individual flame doing its own thing But he's filled you with fire to be like an
2:07:53
angel in the army to be in his army of God on this earth to shine his light to
2:07:59
attract people to him But your role is a warrior in God's army
2:08:05
collectively with your brothers and sisters in Christ Amen
2:08:12
And so the Lord revealed this to me all of a
2:08:17
sudden right in this moment He revealed to me how first of all I want to share
2:08:23
this scripture 2 Kings 6:15 The servant of the man of God got
2:08:29
up early and went out And behold there was an army with horses and chariots encircling the city Elisha's servant
2:08:35
said to him "Oh no my master what are we to do?" Elisha answered "Do not be afraid for those who are with us are
2:08:42
more than those who are with them." Then Elisha prayed and said "Lord please open
2:08:49
his eyes that he may see." And the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he saw and
2:08:54
behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire surrounding Elisha
2:09:01
So it was filled with an angelic army full of
2:09:06
fire And this army of God was so much bigger and more powerful than the army
2:09:12
that that that the servant of Elisha was afraid of that seemed bigger than the physical army of Elisha Hallelujah
2:09:20
And so um Elisha's servant was like afraid Like you could tell in this
2:09:26
moment he's afraid And he's not boldly standing beside Elisha um with faith and
2:09:32
confidence And he's not standing as a warrior He's not standing full of fire in this moment before his eyes are
2:09:38
opening up He's like a bystander trying to figure out if he should run away and hide or what to do you know and his eyes
2:09:47
had to open up God opened his eyes and then he could see the truth He could see
2:09:54
the spiritual reality He could see the lies of the devil that they were really
2:09:59
lies That this was God's army And there was a whole angelic army backing up
2:10:06
God's army backing up Elisha and those with Elisha doing the work of God Amen
2:10:14
And so the Lord revealed to me that you know there are so many people who are
2:10:20
watching this revival who are watching this move of God There are millions
2:10:25
watching There are millions watching like the servant of Elisha Not standing with the move of God
2:10:32
but watching And and and the enemy is coming with lies like look the army against
2:10:40
them is greater The the enemy comes with confusion with lies trying to deceive
2:10:47
trying to keep these people away from the revival trying to keep them away
2:10:52
from fulfilling their purpose to be warriors in God's revival army There are
2:10:57
millions of people like that out there who are watching and and these people watching become
2:11:04
even more confused and unsure when the enemy rises up with his army in that
2:11:12
strategic season like that certain season where Elisha's servant is saying oh
2:11:19
no it wasn't every day there was a certain time there's a certain time when that army came against tried to come
2:11:25
against Elisha's army right and so what
2:11:31
God revealed to me in this moment was that he was opening up eyes over of many
2:11:39
believers and non-believers but many people all over the world who have been watching the move of God who have been
2:11:46
watching the revival but they've been hearing so much of the enemy's lies
2:11:51
They've been confused They've been deceived They've been unsure They've been afraid of persecution They've been
2:11:59
afraid of the naysayers of the critics of the people who seem like scary like
2:12:05
Goliath but really they're defeated and they can never stop the work of God Amen
2:12:11
There's a lot of people like that out there And in this moment God is opening
2:12:19
up their eyes to see the army that has risen and stood with God
2:12:27
And so all of you people from all over the world from 52 nations and 41 states
2:12:34
they gathered together in one physical place to worship Jesus to receive from Jesus to be obedient to Jesus because he
2:12:41
had said "I'm calling you like I called you at the day I called my believers in the day of Pentecost I've called you for
2:12:47
a divine appointment I've called you to unite together to be in one accord to physically come and gather together for
2:12:53
me You have done that people from 52 nations and 41 states And I'm telling
2:12:58
you only God can do that That is so supernatural Hallelujah And it's like
2:13:04
it's like all of you carry the fire because you've chosen to be strong in the Lord because you've chosen to reject
2:13:10
the lie like this beautiful testimony from Germany Barbara that she shared
2:13:17
that is a reflection of all of
2:13:23
you that you've chosen to reject the devil's lies You've you've chosen the
2:13:28
way of surrender That's not it's not the easy way It's the narrow roadway It's the way
2:13:36
less traveled And you've chosen to reject the lies of the devil and you've
2:13:41
chosen to not care what people think You've chosen to die to your ego You've chosen to endure persecution for the
2:13:48
sake of Jesus And you've chosen to take your place in the revival army that God has called you to be a part of And in
2:13:56
turn God has filled you with supernatural fire God has filled you with the light
2:14:01
of the world God has filled you with the hope of Jesus Christ God has filled you
2:14:06
with his anointing that is so mighty and powerful that the world needs and that many don't have that many Christians
2:14:13
don't have He's filled you with a supernatural joy that you cannot
2:14:19
contain where you have to keep praising him and worshiping him because the fire is so great and God has become so real
2:14:27
and good to you Hallelujah Hallelujah And so I see like
2:14:33
in the I see like in the spiritual realm it's like it's like this army has been
2:14:38
out there kind of like angels are all out there but then there's a time where the angels got to stand They got to come
2:14:44
together behind Elisha as this this army comes and it's time for this army to be
2:14:49
seen And I see like like like like you're filled with the fire of the Holy
2:14:54
Spirit You're filled with revival And if anyone looks at you they see that it's supernatural They see that you're like
2:15:00
an angel You're not an angel but you know what I mean Like this symbolic pro that's like a prophetic uh symbol I'm
2:15:06
sharing with you They see you like heaven on earth They they they see
2:15:11
there's something different about you They see that it has to be Jesus They see that it's love like they've never
2:15:16
known They see that it's a joy that they don't have And this is a lot of believers I'm talking about A lot of
2:15:22
believers are going to see your fire and say "I want
2:15:27
that." and and and hallelujah
2:15:33
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
2:15:40
[Applause]
2:15:55
Hallelujah Hallelujah When I run now I got to carry my torch
2:16:05
It's prophetic cuz sometimes I'm running up the mountain like this Now I see it's the carrying the
2:16:13
torch [Applause] Hallelujah This is Christians too A lot
2:16:19
of Christians there in the world they're going to see your light and they're going to be like I want that How do I
2:16:26
find that and you tell them and they're gonna not care like where you found this
2:16:31
light You're going to tell them about the anointing You're going to tell them how you received it how you position
2:16:37
yourself where God's powers is it it where God's power is moving And they're not going to care what the naysayers
2:16:44
have to say about where you received it from because they're going to say "I want
2:16:49
that I want that That is Jesus All I know is that is
2:16:57
Jesus All I know is that is peace joy that is fire for God And I want that
2:17:05
It's fruits You're revealing fruits You're revealing something that's
2:17:10
beautiful that people see is real and good to taste and eat and they want it
2:17:16
for themselves There's no "Oh is that really God?" When you when you really will shine your
2:17:22
light it will be seen by Maybe not by the people that just want
2:17:28
to be in deceit because of evil in their hearts be but but by by by the many
2:17:33
believers in this world There's a lot of them with pure hearts out there And they will be able to see and they'll be able
2:17:39
to see it quicker when you will shine your brightest [Applause]
2:17:45
Hallelujah Hallelujah So okay So the Lord revealed
2:17:51
this to me that just this this this wonder this supernatural occurrence of
2:17:58
people from 52 nations and 41 states coming and not just coming but coming full of the most fire that I and I think
2:18:04
all of us have ever been a part of in our life Like the most heaven on earth we've ever experienced because it was
2:18:09
like 1,000 people from 52 nations and 41 states on fire for
2:18:17
Jesus What's normal what's normal in the church today is for it to be a minority
2:18:22
that's on fire A minority is in the front jumping up and praising God But this was
2:18:30
everybody You're looking like the angelic army You're looking so supernatural Heaven on earth And so God
2:18:38
said that this is the splitting of the sea moment that through this through simply the revival army taking their
2:18:45
place shining so bright revealing their fire and praising God with everything in
2:18:51
them It was going to be God was opening up eyes through this God was opening up eyes around the whole world to see this
2:18:59
is me He's revealing himself through you through the army We are arising We are
2:19:06
arising in this revival army and shining for the world to
2:19:14
see and and I was left in I was left in awe I and I couldn't stop repeating this
2:19:21
Many of you have heard this now like three times because it was so in my fire this what I just shared I mean it was so
2:19:28
in my heart as fire what I have just shared what God spoke to me in that moment at the Q&A session when Thomas
2:19:35
and his wife shared that their question their their question I want to be used
2:19:41
more powerfully in this move of God how and I got home and I shared first I
2:19:47
shared videos of the first day of all of you on fire I shared them with my spiritual father prophet Joe Davyy
2:19:54
I shared it with him and you know he he he actually said he said God is going to be splitting the sea he actually
2:20:00
prophesied that to me He's like "God is going to be splitting the sea at this rise and shine." Okay But he didn't say
2:20:06
other things He didn't speak other things So me I'm expecting a splitting of the sea But me I'm I know God's going
2:20:12
to surprise all us all me included with what that's going to look like with how he's going to do that And so my
2:20:19
spiritual father didn't say anything else in terms of details of like what specifically God would do how this sea
2:20:26
would be split And I was so in awe not surprised but fully
2:20:33
shocked when I listened to a voice message that a voice record audio record audio message that my spiritual father
2:20:40
Prophet Joe Davies sent me last night after he saw the videos and he said this
2:20:45
I'm not kidding He said this This is what God has
2:20:52
done Those people out there that didn't know that God was with 5F that didn't
2:20:57
know if this was really revival that were listening to the naysayers out there and were confused God is opening
2:21:04
up their eyes like how the servant like how the servant of Elisha's eyes were
2:21:09
opened up to see the angelic army He literally said
2:21:15
that He literally said that Hallelujah
2:21:21
[Applause] Hallelujah
2:21:26
Hallelujah Hallelujah So I want to share that amazing confirmation
2:21:34
from God from a true prophet a prophet of prophets in this world that spoke the
2:21:41
same exact thing that God revealed to me that day
2:21:48
Hallelujah Hallelujah
2:21:53
Hallelujah Hallelujah And so you know Elisha servant was now
2:22:00
he could now see and so now he would have been excited to join this beautiful
2:22:05
army of God He would have been so he would been running to join I want to be
2:22:11
a part of that I want to carry that heaven on earth like the angels are I want to be on the winning team I want to
2:22:18
have victory after victory with Jesus I want to be used powerfully by God like they are I want to be set on fire like
2:22:26
they are Hallelujah
2:22:31
Hallelujah Thank you Jesus Isaiah 61 says "Arise Jerusalem Let your

light to shine upon you as you come to him with purity and humility like a
2:29:25
child for merchants from around the world will come to you They will bring you the wealth of many
2:29:32
lands I told I was speaking yesterday for those of you that were at the conference that as you serve God this is
2:29:40
where you are blessed the most And all this is is is is unlocking the
2:29:46
surren the the abundant life that God has promised us Abundant life comes as
2:29:52
you surrender everything to God and become a true child of him And God
2:29:57
honors and blesses those who serve him And God's lifts for his glory those who
2:30:03
serve him Those who serve him with everything surrender everything He can
2:30:09
entrust with more They are the ones with humble hearts that he can lift and they won't steal his glory That he will lift
2:30:16
and they will keep giving him all the glory That he will lift and people will be attracted to Jesus instead of them as
2:30:23
a person And so the more you serve God the more he lifts you And the lifting
2:30:30
looks like lifting in every area It looks like just more favor be coming upon you People will just want to hire
2:30:37
you people will just want to come and and go to your business because they feel they feel joy when they come into
2:30:43
your shop or something Um it it it looks like people wanting to bless you because
2:30:48
you are such a blessing to them They they're just giving you they're giving you money They're just blessing you
2:30:54
because you've blessed them so much They they they bless you So this is how God
2:31:00
lifts you And all of this is for his glory to shine his light and to give and
2:31:05
bless to his kingdom to give more to his kingdom to bless others Amen And so this
2:31:12
will really happen as we arise and shine Wealth from spiritual to financial will
2:31:18
come upon you You will be God will cause doors to open up to be more to bless you
2:31:24
God will move in people's hearts to bless you God will do this
2:31:29
supernaturally himself The more people see Jesus in you
2:31:34
the more they want to bless you And I say bless you as completely for the purpose for God's kingdom Because
2:31:42
whoever God can trust the most he blesses the most in every area including financially
2:31:48
So when it comes to really serving God when money is really coming from God not the devil God blesses those who he can
2:31:56
trust And that's in his timing It doesn't mean that if you don't see if you if you're seeing not many finances
2:32:03
right now that he can't trust you No no no no He takes you through a lot of testing He takes you through ways to see
2:32:09
if he can trust you But he wants he needs his kingdom to advance from
2:32:14
spiritual to financial There there's going to come a time where Orium theater
2:32:19
is not big enough for the conference There's going to come a time
2:32:26
soon So soon there's going to come a time I prophesy that this theater is not
2:32:32
going to be big enough for our Sunday services There's going to come a time soon that
2:32:38
that we will need stad arenas and stadiums all the time for the events
2:32:43
[Applause] Hallelujah And so all of this costs more
2:32:50
money So God what God does is when he's ready to move more and their army is
2:32:55
rising up more he blesses the once he can trust more in the kingdom to give
2:33:01
more to his kingdom so he can do greater things and have bigger arenas to hold
2:33:06
all the people that he brings Amen
2:33:11
Hallelujah Matthew 5:14 you are the light of Christ to the
2:33:16
world A city set on a hill cannot be hidden Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket put on a put but
2:33:23
on a lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house Let your light shine before men in such a way that they
2:33:31
may see your good deeds and moral excellence and recognize and honor and
2:33:36
glorify your father who is in heaven So this is God's direction for
2:33:43
you after the conference This is God's direction for you for all of you that it
2:33:48
is time to put your to take any way that you've been hiding your light Any way
2:33:53
maybe it's through your giftings maybe it's through your words maybe it's through testifying maybe it's through
2:33:58
sharing on social media Any way that you have been hiding your light that God has
2:34:04
given you it's time to take that light from underneath the basket and put it on
2:34:11
the lampstand Put it up high for everyone to see It is time now to arise
2:34:19
and shine like never before As you as you go from here you need to make the
2:34:25
intention every day This is my calling from God This is my assignment This is
2:34:30
my commandment God is demanding this event that he's counting on me that I
2:34:35

2:34:41

2:34:48
choose to be bold confident courageous and like a lion and lioness I will
2:34:55

2:36:35
So stir that fire Keep that fire alive God is counting on you Hallelujah
2:36:41
[Applause] Hallelujah Praise God Praise God You can
2:36:47
have a seat now We are going to be taking communion right now
2:36:53
as a body of Christ as a family And I'm so excited for what God's going to do as
2:36:58
we take communion When when Jesus
2:37:13
says 1 Corinthians
2:37:19
11:23 for I pass unto you what I receive from the Lord himself
2:37:26
On the night when he was betrayed the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it Then he broke it in
2:37:33
pieces and said "This is my body which is given for you Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way he took the cup
2:37:40
of wine after supper saying "The cup is the new covenant between God and his people in agreement confirmed with my
2:37:46
blood Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it For every time you
2:37:52
eat this bread and drink this cup you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes
2:37:58
again Hallelujah The revelation that God has released in
2:38:04
this new wine this new wine that he is is is bringing in this revival is that
2:38:11
communion should not be taken religiously and as a ritual and as a tradition that is done just repetitively
2:38:18
because there is so much power in communion There is so much power in it
2:38:23
in the taking of the communion There is so much power of it be power in it
2:38:28
because it is a symbol of intaking Jesus into our lives of intaking him is our
2:38:35
everything Nothing else but we intake Jesus We fill our lives with Jesus
2:38:42
Nothing else nothing else of this world We eat we fill we eat his word We fill
2:38:49
ourselves with his word When you read the Bible when you read the word when you eat the word which is the bread of
2:38:55
life when you eat it it nourishes you It opens up your eyes to his love It brings
2:39:00
heaven on earth It equips you Gives you victory over the enemy It fills you with God's
2:39:06
love It brings it brings it bring it leads to healing and freedom when you apply God's words When you eat God's
2:39:12
words my book Unlock Your Deliverance it's all based on the word of God It's all giving revelation of what is in the
2:39:20
word of God's directions of how to be free and healed So you receive heaven You receive
2:39:26
healing and freedom as you read the word The word is Jesus is God
2:39:34
So what we're doing right now when we we we eat the bread we drink the juice this
2:39:40
is this is a symbol of what we are doing in the spiritual realm of eating God
2:39:47
eating the word filling ourselves with God so that it he nourishes us and gives
2:39:52
us life and sustains us and gives us energy and strength
2:40:00
Hallelujah And when we drink his blood by his stripes we are healed His blood has removed our
2:40:08
sins His blood has healed us from our sicknesses from our iniquities from our
2:40:13
from the oppression of the enemy Has broken off the curses of our lives So
2:40:19
when we believe in the power of his blood and we intake his blood we receive
2:40:25
his blood in our lives we receive healing This is the action of faith that
2:40:32
I believe that you died for my sins and you also died You died You died to take
2:40:39
away my sins to bring me salvation and abundant life and a relationship with you But also you shed your blood By your
2:40:44
stripes we are healed You have shed your blood so that I could be healed today so that the works of the devil could be
2:40:50
destroyed off my life today So this is the action of faith It's not about
2:40:56
feelings It's not like I feel like God will heal me It's about intaking choose
2:41:02
to choosing to intake his blood into your life to bring
2:41:08
healing to bring freedom from condemnation from the past and sin To
2:41:14
bring freedom from all oppression The blood washes it away The blood is so
2:41:20
powerful that the demons have to flee Hallelujah So when we take communion so
2:41:26
this is a this is what we were doing always but when we take communion it's a special time to renew our minds and
2:41:33
activate our faith even more and honor what Jesus has done for us so that we
2:41:39
can receive more of what he has provided for us that we may be missing
2:41:45
It's a moment we put our eyes on the cross and and what he has done for us
2:41:52
and we we we renew our minds with the power of what he did on the cross The
2:41:57
power of the shedding of blood This lifts our faith This this
2:42:03
makes the faith to grow as we put our eyes there in this powerful moment of
2:42:10
remembrance so that miracles may take place that didn't happen before
2:42:15
because of of your faith being lifted by this action of obedience this action of
2:42:22
faith Amen And so a lot of people they take
2:42:27
communion um religiously and when you do something religiously it loses the
2:42:33
power Just like reading the Bible just like going to church when you do it religiously but not led by the Holy
2:42:40
Spirit the power is gone and it's replaced with activities and
2:42:46
traditions and rituals and entertainment and all other things but the power of
2:42:51
the Holy Spirit So the the Holy Spirit has released this
2:42:57
revelation in this revival in this new wine that when Jesus says when you when
2:43:02
you do this do this in remembrance of me in remembrance the prophetic meaning of
2:43:08
that is the opposite of religious ritual way but it's to do it not all the time
2:43:15
because then it becomes just going through the programs going through the program of doing it but to take a
2:43:23
special moment like how on Christmas and on Easter resurrection Sunday these are
2:43:30
one time a year we don't we don't spec it's is the reason why Easter and
2:43:35
resurrection Sunday is so special is so so special it's always so powerful and
2:43:42
special every year amen with Christmas but it's because it's not every day there's some things
2:43:48
where it's meant to be not always happening but once in a a while so that
2:43:54
there's more meaning and power to it Amen Hallelujah So this is why we are taking
2:44:02
communion today now because this is what the Holy Spirit has led in terms of the
2:44:07
the amount of times to do it in in terms of when to do it And because we are doing it led by the Holy Spirit there's
2:44:14
going to be many miracles that take place as we take communion and after
2:44:19
taking communion Bodies will be healed Demons will go Eyes will open up Ears
2:44:26
will open up in Jesus name Hallelujah
2:44:31
Thank you Jesus Thank you Jesus Jesus said take it and eat it for
2:44:39
this is my body So you can take and eat his bread right now
2:45:01
Thank you Jesus for your flesh for your body that you sacrificed for us for the
2:45:07
scorging you endured for the for enduring those nails going through your
