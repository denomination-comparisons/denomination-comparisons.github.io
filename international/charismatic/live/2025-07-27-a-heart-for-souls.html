40:35
share and it ended up this video, a live stream, some kind of video ended up on

your social media page, one of your social media pages. So God, this is how God is going to continue to grow his
40:47
revival and expand his kingdom and reach more people. So, I want to encourage you
40:54
to not take this lightly, but see the seriousness, the importance of sharing on your social media in any way possible
41:01
on all of your social media pages. We're live right now on Facebook, on YouTube,
41:07
on Instagram. So, if you have all of those pages, you can share a few times.
41:13
Amen. Hallelujah. And also, if you're watching online, share in the comments where
41:18

43:53
There's a couple testimonies that are so powerful that uh I want to share with you and these are actually some of our
44:01
5F church family who are planted at 5F Church from across the world. One is from Greece and one is from Sweden. So,
44:10
we're going to watch these testimonies right now.
44:25
Last year, God did two different miracles as I prayed for my Last year. God did two different miracles as I
44:30
prayed for my
44:35
This is Victor from Sweden. He has a powerful testimony of receiving impartation.
44:42
Hallelujah. Last year, God did two different miracles as I prayed for my friends Andre and Anika who had just recently
44:48
become Christian. So, the first one is that Andre had a smoke issue. Suddenly, it was as if someone was constantly
44:55
blowing smoke into Andre's face. And they share about this in an article where they were in the newspaper sharing
45:01
their testimony. And I'm going to read a little bit from that here. Andre started to experience intense smell of smoke
45:07
even though it was evident that there was no smoke anywhere. Andre opened up about this smoke issue in his church and
45:13
they lay hands on him and prayed and when they did it got even worse. And then I prayed for him and he told me that same night he woke up and started
45:20
to cough and cough and cough and then after some time he finally experienced freedom and since then he hasn't had any
45:27
issues with this. Thank you Jesus. And the second thing that happened was that Andre had told me that he had had
45:32
problems with his facial nerve for more than two years. The nerve caused so that his sinuses very easily got inflamed
45:38
when he was outside. It made it so that he had to stay at home a lot and life got very limited. The doctor said that there was nothing to do about it except
45:45
for a risky surgery that could lead to his face being paralyzed. And I got the opportunity to pray for Andre for the
45:51
healing of this facial nerve. I prayed a very simple prayer and just commanded healing in the name of Jesus. The day
45:56
after he had woken up and felt that he was much much better and this is what he said about it in the article. He tried to go outside and it turned into a hike
46:03
on 15 kilometers that's 9 miles. Since then I haven't been sick. Praise Jesus. Andrea says in the article so this is
46:10
what happened. Andrea got healed when I prayed for him. A more than 2-year lasting suffering that would have
46:15
required a risky surgery that could have caused his face to be paralyzed to potentially heal him. Jesus solved in a
46:22
matter of seconds. It is God only that heals. But the main way that he does it is through people. And this time he used
46:29
me to heal Andre for example. And every Sunday he uses my spiritual leader, Apostle Katherine, to heal different
46:35
people, to release his power, the anointing, and to heal people. And there is a spiritual principle that I want to
46:41
tell you about. This principle is called impartation. Cuz I believe that there is a reason that it was through me that he
46:46
got healed. Cuz when the people in his church prayed, nothing happened. And it even got worse. But when I prayed, he
46:52
got healed immediately. And there is nothing special about me at all. I believe that the reason that this happened is because I am planted in
46:58
five-fold church and I have received impartation from my leader to me. That is an impartation of the power of God. I
47:05
believe that is the reason why Andrea got healed when I prayed and not when other people in this church pray for him. And I want to share that because
47:11
it's a very important principle to how God operates, how one can receive healing and how one can become effective
47:17
in their calling as a Christian too. All all all glory to God. Jesus heals. He
47:22
moves in power and he heals people still today. And I also want to encourage you if you are suffering from something or
47:28
if you're suffering from mental illness for example or whatever it might be, seek God. Seek God in power and receive
47:33
your healing. You too. You do not have to suffer.
47:45
Hallelujah. There's a second video. Yes.
47:50
May you carry revival in Jesus' name. From now may your light shine so
47:57
powerfully. My name is Pericles. I come from Greece. I would like to testify the church of
48:03
Aposto Catholic is a great church where God moves great power so real and great
48:09
and tremendous. Many miracles happens. I have been planted to 5F sets since two
48:15
years. I have equipped tremendously through the anointing and through the teachings of Abasol Kathnik. I have
48:22
built up my faith. I have built up my devotion to God. I have built up my
48:27
surrendering to God. This teaching I have never heard this teaching. I have
48:32
never received teaching such like this. It's wonderful to be landed to the
48:38
church. If you want to receive the anointing, there is a precept and the precipice to be planted. If you don't
48:43
accept to be planted, you don't receive the anointing. I am amazed of all the
48:49
miracles, of all the wonders, for the signs that take place in the church. God
48:54
moves with great power across the whole world. He touches his people, healing
49:00
them, setting free them, and casting out demons. It's amazing all this that takes
49:06
place at 5F Church. Another thing this moving of God the impartation of the anointing it's rarely to see that
49:12
transmits the anointing to other people. I have attended other great servants of God but there was not the impartation of
49:19
the anointing. If you are a minister or you are a servant of God and you want to
49:25
serve God powerfully and do you want to see miracles happening in the ministry
49:30
receive the anointing of the power of God and try this is you move of God
49:35
never has happened into this I call all people who want to share God to be
49:41
planted at five church and receive the anointing and God will move powerfully
49:47
giving to them up that life every Every time I watch an event, I feel from joy,
49:54
excitement, God's power is tremendous. And all people must receive God's power
50:01
and their life will change forever and their personality will change. They will
50:06
be transformed to the image of God. This is my testimony. Hallelujah.
50:13
Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank you Jesus.
50:20
Praise God. So beautiful to see our family from across the world. Greece,
50:25
Sweden. Amen. These are real people. These are real people who are planted
50:31
from 162 nations who are transformed by God's power. Amen. And
50:38
are spreading this revival in that in their part of the world. Hallelujah.
50:44
What joy it is to be part of God's revival, this great move of God here on
50:49
this earth. Amen. What joy it is to be here at the well in LA.
50:55
Where people have traveled ever since 2021, every single week from other
51:01
nations and around the US. Every single week. Praise God. All glory to Jesus.
51:06
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, we're going to get
51:12
into the word of God right now. Are you ready?
51:18
Hallelujah. I know today God is going to do something so life-changing through this
51:24
word. Today, he's going to give you more of his heart. Today, he's going to open
51:29
up your spiritual eyes more. And you will be able to fulfill your
51:35
calling because of what he does today. I believe because of this revelation and impartation. Amen.
51:43
Praise God. So I titled this message a heart for souls.
51:53
In uh uh the the the the is the year this year, the prophetic word of the
51:59
year is that it's the year of acceptance. It it's it's the year to accept Jesus,
52:07
to accept his move, to accept him in his fullness. And God has been preparing
52:12
hearts. He's been planting seeds that's leading to a great harvest that is
52:18
coming this year, that has begun to come this year and will continue.
52:23
The harvest is ripe now because of what God has done, because of the seeds that have been planted by many of you to many
52:31
people around the world. and because of how God has been pursuing his people and preparing their hearts for this moment
52:38
to receive him. Amen. So in in going along with this word of
52:46
the year of what God is doing this year, there has been a prophetic direction for
52:52
all of you for the revival army around the world. And that is to arise and
52:58
shine because the harvest will come in. The lost will come to Jesus when they see
53:05
the light of Jesus. when they see the light of Jesus in God's people on this
53:12
earth. When they can notice this light and be drawn to it, be curious, start
53:20
seeking, and then find him. Amen. And so, here at 5F Church, this is a
53:27
prophetic ministry. This is a prophetic ministry where the messages that are preached are
53:34
prophetic. It's not like a a plan that we make that
53:40
I make on my own of which messages to preach, but it's led by the Holy Spirit
53:46
according to what he's doing on this earth right now and according to what he
53:52
knows that you need to be equipped and to fulfill your purpose right now in
53:59
this present time. Not what you needed last year, not what you needed 5 years ago, not what you'll need next year, but
54:04
what you need right now. And so, because it's the year of acceptance,
54:10
because we must arise and shine now. There have been messages, many messages,
54:16
prophetic messages that I've been sharing with you to teach you how to
54:22
arise and shine, to teach you how to bring in this harvest, to teach you how
54:28
to lead people to accept God in this year of acceptance. Amen.
54:35
Praise God. So, this message today is another one of those messages where
54:40
you're going to be equipped more to know your true divine assignment
54:47
on this earth right now to lead others to Jesus.
54:53
Amen. Hallelujah. [Applause]
54:59
Galatians 5:13.
55:04
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
55:09
Um, Galatians 5:13, for you, my brothers, were called to freedom.
55:15
Only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the sinful nature,
55:22
worldliness, selfishness. But through love, serve and seek the
55:29
best for one another. For the whole law concerning human
55:34
relationships is fulfilled in one precept. You shall love your neighbor as
55:40
yourself. That is, you shall have an unselfish concern for others and do
55:48
things for their benefit.
55:53
So this verse is saying you are free now. God in his grace has set you free.
56:01
Amen. You are flourishing now, walking in abundant life.
56:08
Now you have time on your hands. You have a you have freedom. You are not held back anymore. You have energy. You
56:16
have a great capacity to do so much that you didn't before. Many of you were
56:22
stuck in bondage. And so you couldn't even do selfish things you wanted to do.
56:27
You didn't even have the energy to pursue after selfish ambitions. You were consumed with meditating on how
56:35
oppressed you were. You were consumed with tiredness, sluggishness, stagnancy
56:42
because of this bondage, like stuck in a prison cell.
56:47
But now God has set you free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
56:55
But but it's so important now that you're free
57:00
to understand, you know, you have free will, but it's so important to do what God is asking
57:07
you to do with this freedom he has given you. That's what this verse is saying.
57:12
You're free now. You have energy to pursue after selfish
57:18
ambitions that you didn't before. But don't do that. Don't use your freedom to
57:23
do that. Use your freedom to love others, to
57:28
serve others. Hallelujah.
57:35
Praise God.
57:40
Now is the time to love your neighbor as yourself.
57:46
Now is the time. like never before. Maybe you've been trying to do your best
57:52
in that area for a while. You've been a believer for a while. May you maybe you've been free for a while, for years.
57:58
But now is the time in this year where God is calling you to arise and shine to
58:05
love your neighbor like never before. Hallelujah.
58:12
Hallelujah. Matthew 22:36 it says, "Teacher," saying to Jesus,
58:18
"what, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?" Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your
58:25
God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind." This is the first
58:30
and greatest commandment. A second is equally important. Love your
58:36
neighbor as yourself. Did you catch that? I know many of you
58:42
have heard this scripture a lot, but this scripture really stuck out to me.
58:48
Verse 39, more than ever as I was meditating on this scripture, a second
58:54
commandment is equally important. Many times when we read this verse, you
58:59
may be thinking this number one is the most important. Number two is is is the
59:05
second most important. Is that how anyone ever read that verse in the past? Yeah. And of course the translations it
59:13
depends on the translation but this translation right here gives this powerful revelation that says that this
59:19
the the the second commandment is not secondary
59:25
but it's equally as important equally
59:31
love your neighbor as yourself. John 21:15 it says, "When they had
59:37
finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" Now, this is when
59:44
Jesus was crucified and then was resurrected
59:50
and then he was then he appeared to the disciples. He appeared to Peter right here. And Peter had already gone back to
59:59
to fishing to doing what his previous job was before being a disciple
1:00:05
of Jesus. So Jesus found him fishing. He found him
1:00:12
pursuing what he wanted to pursue, what Peter wanted to pursue.
1:00:18
And he said, "Do you love me more than
1:00:23
these?" Do you love me? Meaning, do you love me more than this job?
1:00:29
Do you love me more than this job that you are doing? This pursuit that you are doing?
1:00:35
Do you love me more than the comfort you have in fishing? You don't have the trouble of the Pharisees
1:00:43
here when you're fishing. Do you love me more than the comfort that this job of
1:00:48
fishing gives you? And then Peter says, "Yes, Lord, you
1:00:55
know that I love you." So Jesus says, "Feed my lambs." So he says, "If you
1:01:02
love me, if you truly love me, if you truly love me more than what you're
1:01:08
pursuing right now, more than what you want to do, more than this job, then
1:01:15
feed my lambs, which means feed my people.
1:01:21
which means spiritually feed, spiritually care for my people.
1:01:32
Love them. If you love me, you will love my people
1:01:38
and you will serve my people. So these two scriptures that I just read, the one about the second
1:01:45
commandment being equally as important as the first to love God with everything. That scripture and this
1:01:52
scripture here, it's saying that to love God equals to love people.
1:02:01
To love God equals loving people.
1:02:09
How to love God? Love people. What does it mean to love God? Love people. How do
1:02:16
I show God that I love him? Love his people.
1:02:21
How do I pour out my heart to him? Love his people. How do I touch his heart?
1:02:26
How do be how do I be a man or woman after his heart? Love his people.
1:02:32
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:02:46
Praise God. So, a lot of people tend to forget this
1:02:53
commandment, that second commandment, the importance of loving people. And
1:02:59
I've mentioned this before, but many people in today's time, they they are so focused on relationship with God, but
1:03:06
they are not having revelation or they are forgetting about this part of God's
1:03:12
heart, his whole heart, that it's for his people.
1:03:20
So to pray and read the Bible means nothing if you're not loving
1:03:26
people. And there's a scripture that says if you do all these things, if you
1:03:32
preach really good, if you do miracles and you have a faith as massive as a
1:03:40
mountain, but no love, no love for people, then you are a clanging symbol.
1:03:47
If you are just reading the Bible and praying and worshiping but not loving people, not really loving people, you
1:03:54
are not showing God love. To love God is to love people.
1:04:02
Period. And so it is so important you grasp this this
1:04:10
aspect of God's heart as I was sharing last week. Grow in the knowledge of God of his love for his people.
1:04:18
That's how you will be able to love God well and fulfill your purpose.
1:04:24
How do you love people better? Well, you need to renew your mind with the
1:04:30
truth. You need to renew your mind first of all with the truth of how you needed
1:04:36
Jesus. You were a sinner. What have you done in your past
1:04:43
without Jesus? Do you remember that? When you see other people acting in
1:04:50
immoral ways with bad behavior, you need to remember that that was once
1:04:57
you. Maybe it's different their bad behavior,
1:05:03
but that was once you in one way or another.
1:05:08
You need to remember also number one that the devil is behind
1:05:16
every kind of evil in this world. When people do bad things, they are
1:05:24
being influenced by the devil. They don't do bad things just on their own
1:05:29
because they're an evil person by nature. Because they're just a bad person, bad to the bone. They do bad
1:05:36
things because they were influenced by the devil. Because there is a strategic attack sent towards them from the devil
1:05:45
to send evil thoughts to them, to send evil emotions in them, negative emotions
1:05:52
to them. And they didn't realize it, but they were played by the devil.
1:06:00
He spoke to them. They listened and they followed that voice. They thought it was
1:06:05
themselves. They thought it was just the right thing to do because this is what they feel so strongly to do. But the
1:06:12
reality is is it was the devil.
1:06:18
You got to remember that the devil's behind everything. You got to remember that
1:06:24
a lot of people, they are not in the same place where you are right now. They have not been given that grace that you
1:06:30
have right now. God actually wants to use you to release that grace upon them to show them love,
1:06:36
the kindness of God that will lead them to repentance. They're in the season that you were in
1:06:42
in the past. They're just in a different season that you once were. And there
1:06:47
were people that looked at you with eyes of love, the love of God,
1:06:54
and saw you not as the world saw you, saw you not for what you deserved, but saw you with the grace and love and
1:07:00
compassion of Jesus. And they were vessels of God that
1:07:05
ultimately led you into salvation.
1:07:11
So that you will have an eternity in heaven and that you will be free of heaven and torment. be free, I'm sorry,
1:07:17
be free of hell and torment and bondage of the devil on this earth right now.
1:07:22
Amen. And so these people that you see doing bad things, no matter the the the
1:07:27
the most extreme evil or maybe it's just someone close to you that bothers you,
1:07:33
they get they're annoying sometimes. They're having selfish behavior. Sometimes they lash out sometimes.
1:07:39
No matter the spectrum of evil, of actions that are not like Christ, it is
1:07:46
being influenced by the devil. And when you can remember that and put
1:07:54
on your new self and see people in with spiritual eyes, with the eyes of God,
1:07:59
you will get mad at the devil and not at people. You will hate the devil, not people.
1:08:06
And it Hallelujah. And then you will see clearly that you once were influenced by the devil.
1:08:13
You'll remember that you were once influenced by the devil, but Jesus's power is greater and you
1:08:19
just needed rescuing. And that rescuing happened from Jesus and Jesus and a
1:08:25
vessel that Jesus used. And so then you can see people
1:08:30
with truth with with how it really is. You can see that people need rescuing
1:08:37
from the devil's influence, from the devil's bondage that's been placed upon their lives. They need rescuing. And you
1:08:45
can play a part in in their rescue, in their salvation.
1:08:50
And so, it's such a different mindset to carnally see somebody if they do evil,
1:08:56
you hate them. You can't forgive them. You have bitterness towards them. You have negative thoughts towards them. and
1:09:03
you see them as a bad person, as an evil person. But when you see with in the spiritual realm, you don't see any of
1:09:09
that. You see a person who's lost, who is in bondage, who was influenced by the devil, like you once were, maybe in a
1:09:16
different way, but you once were like them, and they need saving, and you're like a lifeguard that can help save
1:09:22
them. It's so different. It's such a different
1:09:28
perspective. It's night and day. And we have to remember I shared last
1:09:34
week, if you weren't here last week, watch the message last week, but I shared there's a scripture that says you must put on your new self.
1:09:42
You must put on your new self. You must renew your mind with this revelation. This revelation I'm sharing with you,
1:09:47
many of you already have this revelation, but you might not be thinking about it every day. You have to put on your new self. You have to renew
1:09:54
your mind with this truth of the spiritual realm. It should be automatic
1:09:59
when somebody does something bad, whether it's to you or you see something on the news, it's something far away
1:10:05
from you, it should be automatic that you hate the devil and not the person
1:10:11
that you see, oh, this person is oppressed, they need Jesus. Oh, this person is deceived. They need
1:10:17
Jesus. And it should the the passion should be
1:10:23
to serve God more to love God's people more knowing that
1:10:28
you can actually make a difference for there to be less evil in the world
1:10:34
if you will be a vessel of Jesus so Jesus can rescue these people.
1:10:40
Amen. I remember when I went to my spiritual
1:10:45
father's church one time in Tanzania, Prophet Javier, my spiritual father, I
1:10:51
went to his church and one of the most life-changing days of my life was when I went there one time where there was mass
1:10:58
deliverance taking place and I had never seen mass deliverance take place in my life and I saw my spiritual father walk
1:11:06
in the authority of Christ like I had never seen in my entire life and it was
1:11:12
like the Bible come alive because demons were manifesting everywhere. Demons were
1:11:18
like popcorn were speaking out of people, were yelling out of people. And he just walked in this firm authority of
1:11:26
Christ. Like meaning the most serious business with the devil that I've ever seen. Like serious business. Like not
1:11:34
letting the devil get away with keeping these people in bondage. That's what I
1:11:39
saw in his face. It was such seriousness. Such s so fierce like a
1:11:44
lion. And I saw the the lion of Judah in my spiritual father. Like I saw the heart of Jesus
1:11:51
with this fierceness with this meaning serious business devil.
1:11:57
You must leave this person, this precious child of God.
1:12:04
You cannot torment them any longer. It was just this
1:12:11
um immediate, you know, just this person needs
1:12:16
rescuing. Boom, boom, boom. You must go. You must
1:12:21
go. Demon, go. Go. And the demons would leave so quickly. And the demons would
1:12:28
also, the demons that I saw manifested, these people, they would speak out of the people. Some of the some of them would speak out of the people. Some of
1:12:34
them would reveal um their their plans like there was this
1:12:40
one demon that said out of a person out of a woman I am I am making her
1:12:47
influencing her to sleep around with so many people so she will get HIV
1:12:54
like the demon spoke that that that was their plan the assignment upon this woman's life.
1:13:00
another demon. They spoke spoke out of the woman. Um, I've been trying to kill her in this
1:13:08
way and this way and this way. I don't remember the details now, but just describing different ways. And now I've
1:13:13
sent a rock in her throat. And as my spiritual father commanded the demon to
1:13:19
go, a a pebble like the size of maybe a fingernail like came out of her throat.
1:13:25
And I saw it with my two eyes. But I had never before seen the
1:13:32
spiritual realm exposed like this. I had never before seen how evil really the
1:13:37
devil was. I had never before seen how busy at work the devil was tormenting
1:13:43
people. I had never realized that had that revelation until that moment. But my
1:13:50
spiritual eyes opening up to see how evil the devil was gave me so much
1:13:55
compassion for people. It it's like from that day I was changed. It was a combination of seeing
1:14:02
how evil the devil was like never before. But then I also saw how great and fierce and compassionate God is. His
1:14:11
his love is for his people. As I saw, you know, there wasn't any hesitation.
1:14:16
It was just my spiritual father would cast demon after demon out of person after person. Boom. Fast with such
1:14:23
seriousness, with such fierceness. Um, I had never seen God's
1:14:30
passion and ambition and commitment to rescue his people like that in my entire life.
1:14:37
And I remember that day, this is how my spiritual eyes opened up. Number one, as I saw
1:14:45
just God deliver person after person after person through my spiritual father with such ease, I realized when before I
1:14:53
had questions like how come bad things happen to good people
1:14:59
because of course you know God you God works out everything for the good but then there's some things it's just even
1:15:04
hard to understand like such horrible things where you don't even see the good at all. You know, as believers, many can have that question. That question
1:15:11
disappeared completely from my mind that day, and it never came back again. It wasn't even like I questioned God in
1:15:17
that. It's not even like I was questioning his heart. I never questioned his goodness before that
1:15:23
time, but it's like it was confusing. It wasn't clear to me. But that day, it
1:15:29
became crystal clear as I saw Jesus deliver person after person after person
1:15:35
from demonic oppression through my spiritual father. It became crystal clear that God has the power to deliver
1:15:42
and heal everyone. And he wants to heal and deliver everyone.
1:15:53
He wants to heal and deliver everyone. It's just that he has a way of moving. He is so strict to his word. He doesn't
1:16:01
go outside of his word, outside of his principles. He what I mean is he doesn't bend to
1:16:08
people's will. He does, you know, people want things
1:16:13
comfortable and easy. So they want miracles to come in an easy comfortable way. But God has his principles in which
1:16:21
miracles come. And that's by faith. That's by positioning yourself where the
1:16:26
power of God is moving. and by him putting anointing in vessels and moving in
1:16:32
moving through the vessels as they walk in their authority in Christ
1:16:38
and the rest of his keys of the kingdom principles. You can find all of those keys on my playlist on YouTube, how to
1:16:44
receive complete deliverance and maintain your deliverance. And also on my my book, Unlock Your Deliverance. I
1:16:49
share all these different keys, but these are the two huge ones, faith and God moving in power through a vessel. So
1:16:56
positioning yourself to be there to receive. So my eyes open up in this moment
1:17:02
because I also had never seen the love of Jesus and the character of Jesus like I had seen through my spiritual father.
1:17:08
I had also never seen miracles happen, the power of God move like I had seen through my spiritual father. I had never
1:17:14
seen the Bible come alive looking like the axe church like I did through my spiritual father and not my spiritual
1:17:20
father's church. So everything just clicked in that moment that day. Everything just clicked.
1:17:26
God wants to move empower and heal and deliver every person. But you have to come to him not in your own way. You
1:17:33
have to seek him. You have to seek him not in a way that you want to seek him, but seek him in his way. Following his
1:17:39
principles that are in his word that require humility to have revelation of his word.
1:17:46
It clicked to me and from that moment on it was so simple in my mind. the
1:17:52
goodness of God, the love of God. God loves everybody. He wants to heal and deliver everybody.
1:17:58
Somebody needs oppression, somebody needs sickness, they just need to seek Jesus. Not any old way. Not going to a
1:18:04
lukewarm church and doing it in their doctrine.
1:18:12
But really seeking after God's heart. Really humbling yourself. That's seeking God is humbling yourself. Becoming like
1:18:18
a child. I need you, God. Not, oh, I have everything figured out the
1:18:24
Christian way. I need you, God. I humble myself
1:18:29
and I seek you. So, show me where to go to find you. Show me direct my steps to
1:18:35
where I can find you in your fullness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:18:42
It became so simple and clear to me that day. And I've lived in that mentality, in that mindset, in that revelation
1:18:49
since that day. Amen. And I see people so simply. I just every everywhere I go, I see people that
1:18:54
way. I see people like, "Oh, they need Jesus. They need his power.
1:19:01
Oh, if they come, if they if they would come with hunger, if they would come seeking him, God would deliver and heal
1:19:07
them like that. Yeah. And if they would just surrender their
1:19:13
lives and if they would just be serious about maintaining their deliverance by applying these principles from God that
1:19:19
he's given in his word. But we need his revelation, the new wine, then they will
1:19:24
maintain their freedom. They will walk in abundant life, easy, simple, black and white. Amen.
1:19:36
And so that day, my my love for people increased like never
1:19:42
before. Number one, because I saw the love of God, loving people, meaning serious business to kick the devil out
1:19:49
of people's lives and that fierce compassion like a lion for people that I saw
1:19:56
displayed through my spiritual father through the anointing. But number two, seeing how evil the
1:20:03
devil is and seeing that whoo, it's really that simple and black and white.
1:20:09
Whatever bad behavior someone has, whatever bad things somebody's doing,
1:20:14
it's because they were influenced by the devil. Now, people have free will, but
1:20:20
so many people, they do not have their spiritual eyes opened up.
1:20:26
So, they feel this strong feeling and they're confused.
1:20:33
They they know it's wrong, but it's like something's overtaking them.
1:20:38
And so they do a bad thing. They sin. So many people don't have their
1:20:44
spiritual eyes open up to know how real the devil is in our feelings and our
1:20:49
emotions. How we h how what you think and feel comes from the devil. Many times
1:20:56
it literally comes sent from the devil to try to influence you and pull you a certain direction and make you do
1:21:01
something bad. So many people don't know that. So of
1:21:07
course they're not going to be equipped to walk in victory over the devil's scheme on their life. Of course they're
1:21:14
going to sin. They're going to do a bad thing. Of course their eyes aren't opened up yet. What do
1:21:21
you expect? We also have to have so much grace for
1:21:27
people because many people do not have the the the the
1:21:32
past that you had. If you had a bad past, if you had
1:21:40
parents who were abusive, if you went through trauma and abuse growing up,
1:21:46
bullying, really hard things, then generally
1:21:51
you'll probably be more apt to have compassion for people, empathy for people. But those of
1:21:58
you that didn't have that as your past, those of you that had more grace upon
1:22:04
your life growing up than others, you have to make more of an intention to
1:22:10
have compassion for people.
1:22:16
You have to renew your mind about how the devil has been at work in
1:22:21
people's lives. and that's shaped them and that's made them who they are today. Not that they choose to be like this,
1:22:28
that they want to be like this. Amen. I know my my my parents I had the most
1:22:33
amazing childhood. I couldn't ask for a better childhood. I couldn't ask for a better parents. They love Jesus and they
1:22:39
were Christlike. They were so p they are they were and are so pure.
1:22:47
And I know that that is such a big reason why I didn't veer off. Though I in high school and college, I lived
1:22:55
lukewarm in some areas of my life, but I didn't go far from God's will.
1:23:02
And I know that it's because of this grace of my upbringing.
1:23:10
So, you know, I have to I remember these people who have who who do evil things that maybe I didn't do such evil things.
1:23:18
Their past was probably different. The enemy there was probably a lot of
1:23:24
open doors out of their control that they didn't open up themselves that led for the enemy to be able to influence
1:23:31
them so much more than the e the devil was able to influence me.
1:23:36
So, of course they're behaving this way. Of course they're sinning like this.
1:23:45
They need to encounter God's power and his love for their eyes to open up
1:23:52
to be able to choose Jesus and then to be able to continually choose Jesus to be equipped to have victory over the
1:23:59
devil and not let the devil influence them anymore.
1:24:06
Yeah. So, I'm sharing how to love people.
1:24:14
You have to put on your new self and renew your mind to the spiritual realm, to the spiritual reality.
1:24:21
If someone lashes out at you, if someone isn't as kind to you, they pro they
1:24:27
could have had a bad day. It could have been a strategic attack of the devil towards them on that day.
1:24:34
Remember that. Renew your mind of that. And then you'll be able to love them
1:24:41
rather than giving them what they deserve and lashing back eye for eye.
1:24:46
You have to renew your mind and see in the spiritual realm.
1:24:52
To love people means to love everybody. When God says
1:24:57
if if you love me, feed my lambs. When Jesus says this and when God says when Jesus says the second commandment is
1:25:03
equally as great as the first. Love people as yourself. Love your neighbor as
1:25:09
yourself. This is what your neighbor means. This is what the lambs mean. This is the
1:25:14
meaning of the people you should love. Everybody. Those who are nice to you, your friends,
1:25:22
your church family, and your enemies. those who treat you
1:25:28
wrongly and strangers.
1:25:36
We're called to love everybody and and and and out of the people we're called to love, most of them we'll never
1:25:43
meet. They are strangers. But we are called to love them. Not only
1:25:50
love our friends, not only love those we know, but everybody.
1:26:00
How do we love everybody? By serving God.
1:26:08
Feeding the lambs. He's speaking this to Peter. Preach.
1:26:13
That was that was Peter's specific calling as an apostle was to preach and walk in signs, wonders, and miracles
1:26:21
and to spiritually feed regularly his congregation, his disciples,
1:26:28
the members of his church, his disciples.
1:26:34
But feeding the sheep, it it looks different for everybody. It can be summarized as this.
1:26:41
serving God, doing the work of God, contributing to the work of God.
1:26:48
Amen. Like for example, you might not call be
1:26:53
called like what like as an apostle what Peter was called to. You may not be called to be preaching sermons,
1:27:02
but you know there's there's we have an editing team here at FFold Church and they are working so hard every day. I
1:27:10
see them with my own eyes. I'm communicating with them hours each day
1:27:17
to to to to edit these videos with excellence, the sermons and short clips of the
1:27:24
messages so that so many more people may be fed
1:27:30
than the 300 than the hundreds that are here and the those watching online. So that so many more are fed. So those
1:27:37
that are editing and those of you that are sharing the clips on your social media page, what
1:27:44
are you doing? What are they doing? Feeding the sheep.
1:27:53
Though we we we and we need excellence for God's kingdom. That's how more
1:27:58
people are reached. Because when we put out junk, who wants
1:28:05
to watch that? This is how we be the light of the
1:28:10
world. Being the light means to means to be of
1:28:15
excellence and a high standard. It means to be aware of the standard of
1:28:22
the world in today's time. So, we got to make sure we got a camera that's clear.
1:28:30
We got to make sure we're doing things right so that it's not losing quality when we post it. You know, we got to
1:28:35
care about these things so that more people will look at the video and not look away because they
1:28:42
judge the book by its cover. People do judge books by cover. We have to make sure our cover is looking good,
1:28:48
right? We got to do everything we can to help
1:28:54
people stay focused there. People are be pulled left and right in this world. So many things they can watch, so many
1:29:00
videos they can watch, so many things they can be doing. In the age of social media, in the age of the internet, of
1:29:06
now AI, I mean there's so many more things that we can spend our times doing, our life doing.
1:29:13
So we have to like raise the standard up in this area even to make sure things
1:29:20
have excellence to attract the most amount of people to grab their attention. Amen. Amen.
1:29:31
But so so even to be here in this place, it's a place of excellence. It's a place of more excellence than we when we than
1:29:38
we were in the past. And it matters. It's drawing more people to come see. And not just that, but to help people
1:29:44
see this is this is a place I can receive from here. This is a place I can grow here.
1:29:53
You know, there's seasons for everything. But there's some people that in their
1:29:58
mind they they know they want to be part of a church, but it needs to look like a church.
1:30:05
If we just stay in the grass forever, we're missing people who aren't coming.
1:30:11
They're seeing it as an event, but not as a church, a place they can grow, a place that they could be equipped, a
1:30:18
place they can have covering. Amen. So these things matter. like having a a a venue like this to worship
1:30:27
God and to preach the word that will go to millions. It matters.
1:30:37
Hallelujah. But it it costs about $15,000 to be here
1:30:43
every week to be in this venue to pay for the live streaming and camera costs
1:30:50
and all these things that go into it, the lighting, the audio, the we have someone doing the sound so
1:30:56
that the live stream sounds good in a different room. So those of you that give, you are
1:31:04
feeding the lambs. It's not just me feeding the lambs,
1:31:11
preaching the word. It's everything that makes the preaching of the word and the
1:31:16
ministry of Jesus go forth.
1:31:21
That's feeding the lambs. Feeding the most amount of lambs.
1:31:27
Amen. Hallelujah.
1:31:38
Um,
1:31:45
Acts 12 uh 13:22. But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, I
1:31:53
have found David, son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.
1:32:06
So we have another definition here of what loving God looks like.
1:32:13
David was a man after his own heart. Meaning he really loved God.
1:32:19
Wasn't just religiously loving God with words but no actions but
1:32:25
like his heart was after God's. He was really loving God.
1:32:31
But this scripture gives us a definition, another definition of what more meaning
1:32:37
of what loving God means. It says, "He will do everything I want
1:32:44
him to do. He's a man after my own heart." This is what it means to be a man after my own heart. In other words,
1:32:50
he will do everything I want him to do. So to love God is to obey God.
1:33:00
It says in 2 John 1:6, "And this is love that we walk in obedience to his
1:33:07
commands." This is real love. This is real love for God that you walk in obedience to his
1:33:16
commands. So we have the definition of loving God.
1:33:22
Now, loving people and obeying him. I like to say that God's love language,
1:33:29
the way we show love to him the most is by obeying him.
1:33:35
His love language is obedience.
1:33:42
So, I want to share with you now three main areas of
1:33:48
obedience to God of like like defining what obedience to God looks like.
1:33:54
Number one, spending time with God
1:34:00
in the word, in prayer, talking with God daily,
1:34:07
worshiping him, having intimacy with him. That's the first aspect of obedience to
1:34:15
God. The second aspect of obedience to God is
1:34:22
being spiritually mature. That is a choice.
1:34:28
How to be spiritually mature is to be a true disciple.
1:34:36
Not a churchgoer, not a Christian by name, but a disciple.
1:34:42
A disciple is a learner, is a student, humble, childlike student.
1:34:50
So to be a disciple is to be planted at the church where God's calling you to be
1:34:56
planted. be a spiritual son or daughter under the spiritual father or mother, God's calling you to be planted like how
1:35:01
Timothy and other disciples were were planted under Apostle Paul, like how
1:35:06
Elisha was planted under Elijah and being a disciple of the teachings
1:35:16
under your spiritual leader or leaders,
1:35:21
taking the teachings to heart, applying those teachings, applying the principles The principles are to equip you to be
1:35:28
spiritually mature. The principles, the teaching that is released, the teaching, the equipping that's
1:35:34
released is to help you overcome the devil's schemes, how to have victory over the devil.
1:35:39
It opens up your spiritual eyes so that you can become spiritually mature. Because God wants to see you grow. He
1:35:46
doesn't want to see you be a baby. The devil is so tiny and dinky. He's
1:35:52
under our feet. But we have to be disciples to learn how
1:35:58
to overcome him who is smaller or he won't seem smaller. He will seem bigger than what you can handle.
1:36:06
He will seem more powerful than you as a Christian.
1:36:12
But when you become a true disciple and then God can open up your spiritual eyes, you you come with a childlike
1:36:17
heart to hear the teachings where you are planted and you apply the principles in your life. You become this spiritual
1:36:23
giant, a giant of faith. Eyes that are so open in the spiritual
1:36:29
realm, understanding how the spiritual realm works, understanding the schemes of the devil, and knowing how to conquer
1:36:36
the devil's schemes, how to have victory every time. So God wants to see you grow. It's not
1:36:44
hard to do. You have to be obedient to be a disciple. And so he wants to see you grow because
1:36:50
if you don't grow then you're not fulfilling your calling on this earth. You are not leading others to Jesus or
1:36:57
at least in the capacity that you are called to if you don't grow.
1:37:02
So that's why being spiritually mature you need to see this as obedience to God and love to God.
1:37:10
That's why even when I pray I am careful what I say. I don't want to disappoint
1:37:16
God. I know better. I don't want to complain when I know that God is good.
1:37:22
He is in control. His timing is different than mine but better. And he allows everything to work for our good.
1:37:30
And we got to go through refining fire. It's for our good. So if there's refining fire uncomfortable times right
1:37:36
now, I'm in a valley right now. It's for my good. It's needed to fulfill the promise.
1:37:42
To see the promise fulfilled. It's needed to walk in my calling. So, it's spiritually foolish to complain to
1:37:49
God one word. So, I don't complain to God. The closest I've gotten to complaining to God in the
1:37:56
past um eight years when my eyes open up like I
1:38:01
described to you for example, one of the big ways my eyes open up as I shared with you going to my spiritual father's church the the closest I've come to
1:38:08
complaining which I don't I don't I don't see as complaining is go Jesus
1:38:14
like great no I don't want this I don't want to wait longer really God is how I
1:38:21
felt in my heart but it's just Jesus Yes, that's the closest I got to complaining
1:38:27
truthfully. Hallelujah. And I don't consider it complaining, but I was shocked myself after that. It's
1:38:33
like, whoa. But I I immediately said, "Thank you, Lord. I trust you.
1:38:38
I trust you. Your ways are best. Just give me the grace to handle this. Be give me the grace to be patient, Lord.
1:38:44
Help me. I need your strength. I need your strength to have contentment
1:38:49
here." But because because I I've grasped this
1:38:54
to obey God is to be spiritually mature. To not be a baby, to not be a victim,
1:39:03
to not play dumb when God in his grace has revealed you the truth.
1:39:10
God is good. God is faithful. God's ways are best. He knows better
1:39:16
than us. Get this in you. There's no need to complain.
1:39:23
No need to. It doesn't do anything but hinder your growth. It doesn't do anything but open up the door to the
1:39:30
devil as he hears you speaking on his frequency of negativity in the spiritual realm.
1:39:37
Get this in your mind. How to show love to God, how to be obedient to God is to
1:39:43
grow up. Choose to be spiritually mature. Choose to walk in the truth God revealed
1:39:49
to you. Choose to be a revival warrior.
1:39:56
Choose to put on your armor of God. Pick up the shield of faith. Take up the
1:40:03
sword of the spirit. Action words here. It's an action.
1:40:10
It's an action. It's a choice to put on the armor of God. It's a choice to obey God, to reject the devil, to renew your
1:40:17
mind to the truth. To speak only words of life. It's a
1:40:22
choice. Connect this in your head that this is obedience to God. This is showing God
1:40:28
love. This is what God equates as love is being spiritually mature.
1:40:35
Amen. So the third main area of obedience to God
1:40:44
is loving people. So number one, your relationship with
1:40:49
God, spending time with God is obedience. Number two, being spiritually mature. And number three, loving people.
1:40:58
Only three that you got to think about, but you should renew your mind with these three every day. I want to love
1:41:03
God today. How do I love God? Spend time with him. Be spiritually mature.
1:41:10
Make that choice to to renew your mind and walk in the truth and walk in authority over the
1:41:17
devil and make the choice to praise God in every circumstance and thank him. Amen.
1:41:23
And number three, love people. This should be in your mind every day.
1:41:30
This should be your intention every day. There will be opportunities to do all three of these things every single day.
1:41:40
And if you don't interact with people on one day, because that can happen. Maybe you work from home. Maybe you live at home. How do you love people? Do the
1:41:48
work of God. That's that's doing the work of God is just as important as showing love to someone one-on-one.
1:41:55
Just as important. How h how do I do the work of God? Use
1:42:01
your social media. Share the good news. Share the videos. And there's tons of
1:42:07
videos you can share. You can love people every single day.
1:42:15
Hallelujah. With ease, quickly.
1:42:20
Praise God.
1:42:28
When you make this intention to love people every day, loving people out of obedience. I know I have to love people
1:42:33
today. So, how can I love people today? As you make that intention, the holy the
1:42:39
Holy Spirit will reveal to you you'll hear his voice guiding you of how to love people.
1:42:45
Amen. Of how to serve him. Um, and you you you need to I I this is
1:42:52
also very important. And another way that important way to love people is to renew your mind with this importance of
1:42:59
loving people that loving people and serving God. Loving people by serving
1:43:04
God, serving God in his work is the most urgent pressing matter in
1:43:10
the entire world. In the entire world because you do not know
1:43:15
whose day is their last day on this earth. Come on. There how many people are in this world?
1:43:22
I don't even know. Billions, right? Billions. How many?
1:43:28
Eight billion. Now, we could we can Google this later.
1:43:34
They probably have the statistics. Not just No, not that. But that, too. But we can Google later. How many people pass
1:43:40
away today? They have the statistics. I don't know them right now. I didn't think to look it up.
1:43:48
Somebody knows. 7,000 an hour. Thank you.
1:43:53
7,000 an hour. 7,000 people per an hour.
1:43:59
So, we are here and there's going to be almost 20,000
1:44:04
people that will pass away while we are here. And where are they going to go? Heaven or hell?
1:44:14
And we all play a part on this earth. We all have a chance to help lead people
1:44:20
to heaven, to Jesus. You are that important.
1:44:26
What you do is that important, is that valuable.
1:44:32
And so, we don't know who out there in those 20,000 in just a
1:44:40
few hours that we're here will pass away. But we absolutely could reach them.
1:44:47
those people right now. Like right now, even if if it's time for them to go right now, if this is just God's time
1:44:52
for them, right now they could they could receive Jesus right now through the screen. And I pray you will receive Jesus right
1:44:59
now. If this is you, give your life to him now. Give your life to him. Surrender to him.
1:45:07
Just say, "I choose you, Jesus. I give my life to you, Jesus. I surrender to you, Jesus." And you'll become saved.
1:45:14
Hallelujah. But when you think about like the the impact that we have here at Fivefold
1:45:21
Church, it's a big impact. It's not just me that has an impact. There are about two there are about two million
1:45:27
followers and subscribers amidst all the social media pages. Almost 1 million on my YouTube page alone. And that's just
1:45:34
people who have chosen to hit the button follow subscribe. But there are millions out there. I
1:45:40
don't know the exact number millions. There could be billions. I don't know who that a video of five of church will
1:45:47
show up on their page.
1:45:52
And so it's actually wild to think about if if millions and millions are being
1:45:58
reached through this work of God and it's new people each day that have never
1:46:03
seen it before. Some of those people their last day on this earth might be tomorrow.
1:46:09
today might be two days later
1:46:17
and and and Jesus could save them through us
1:46:22
just in time do you see the urgency
1:46:31
that we have a heart for souls because it's through us that God reaches
1:46:37
people that's the main way that people become become saved. Every one of you, I believe every one of
1:46:43
you, God used at least one person to be where they were a vessel of God.
1:46:49
Is that true for anybody that at least one person was a vessel of God that led
1:46:55
you was a seed planted that led you to believe and give your life to Jesus? Raise your hand if that's you
1:47:01
in the in the comments. Write that's me. Yes, it's everybody. Yeah,
1:47:07
everybody. Whether you realize it or not, it's been everybody. Maybe you don't even remember. Maybe
1:47:12
you're like, "No, that's not me." Well, you probably flipped past the channel one day, someone preaching on TV just
1:47:18
for a second, and God planted a seed through it. Somebody you didn't know was a Christian
1:47:23
showed you the love of God, and it it planted a seed you don't even know,
1:47:29
but there was a light in them that led you ultimately to Jesus.
1:47:36
This is eternity. We're talking about eternity. People will go to heaven or hell.
1:47:46
And we have the choice to lead people to heaven or hell. We have the choice. We can literally
1:47:53
lead people to Jesus. Lead people to an eternity in heaven
1:47:59
by loving them. By simply loving them. By loving them. by serving God.
1:48:09
Not just life after death, but so many are in hell on earth right now.
1:48:16
God doesn't want them to be bound by the devil anymore, oppressed by demons anymore, sick. He wants to heal them and
1:48:23
deliver them. They can receive Jesus's power upon their life right now.
1:48:29
right now. If you if we would love people,
1:48:35
have a heart for these souls, serve God so he can expand his work and
1:48:42
reach more people. Amen. So, you need to renew your mind. This is something you should be renewing
1:48:48
your mind every day. And renew your mind more when you're having a day where you're feeling selfish. You need to
1:48:54
renew your mind how serious and urgent this is. to save people,
1:49:02
to be a vessel of God that can lead them into salvation and freedom and healing.
1:49:12
As you're doing the work of God, as you're serving in whatever way, renew your mind. As I'm doing this, more
1:49:18
people will be saved. More people will be saved. Absolutely.
1:49:24
100%. Because I am doing this. because I am doing this work of God. More people will be saved. Will come into the
1:49:29
kingdom. We'll we'll go to heaven when they die. We'll no longer be living in torment on this earth. Amen.
1:49:35
Hallelujah. That's powerful. So many of you have been missing this
1:49:41
revelation and you're wondering why it feels so hard to serve God. Just renew your mind.
1:49:48
This will give you great compassion and motivation and zeal to serve God, to
1:49:53
love people. Amen. Hallelujah. Exodus 4:1.
1:50:04
But Moses protested again. What if they won't believe me or listen to me? What if they say, okay, so some context
1:50:11
before I go on with this scripture. What God has just spoken to Moses. I'm calling you to be a mouthpiece of me.
1:50:17
I'm calling you to lead my children out of Egypt, out of bondage, and take them
1:50:23
to the promised land. And so Moses is now saying to God, "What if they won't
1:50:28
believe me or listen to me? What if they say the Lord never appeared to you?" Then the Lord asked him, "What is that
1:50:34
in your hand?" "A shepherd's staff," Moses replied. "Throw it down on the
1:50:40
ground," the Lord told him. So Moses threw down the staff and it turned into a snake. Moses jumped back. Then the
1:50:46
Lord told him, "Reach out and grab its tail." So Moses reached out and grabbed it and turned back and it turned back
1:50:52
into a shepherd's staff in his hand. perform this sign. The Lord told him, "Then they will believe that the Lord
1:50:57
your the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob really has appeared to you." Then
1:51:02
the Lord said to Moses, "Now put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand inside the cloak and he took it out again. His hand was white as snow
1:51:10
and with a severe skin disease. "Now put your hand back into your cloak," the Lord said. So Moses put his hand back in
1:51:16
and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body. Verse 10. But Moses pleaded with the Lord, "Oh
1:51:21
Lord, I'm not very good with words. I never have been and I'm not now even though you have spoken to me. I get tongue-tied and my words get tangled.
1:51:27
Then the Lord asked Moses, "Who makes a person's mouth? Who decides whether people speak or do not speak? Hear or do
1:51:32
not hear? See or do not see? It is not I, the Lord. Now go. I will be with you as you speak and I will I will instruct
1:51:40
you in what to say." Hallelujah. So beginning with a beginning with the
1:51:48
the first part of the scripture. Um, so Moses is basically saying like, "How can
1:51:54
I do what you've called me to do on this earth? How can I be this mouthpiece of you and lead
1:52:00
your people? How can I lead your people into freedom in salvation? How can I do
1:52:06
how me? What can I do? I'm just little old me
1:52:13
and I can't even talk well." But God says, "What is in your hand? And
1:52:20
there was a shepherd in his hand. I mean sorry there was a shepherd staff in his hand. Now he was a shepherd.
1:52:27
God had given him the ability gifting to be a shepherd.
1:52:33
And so that same ability, that same provision of the staff that he
1:52:40
had in his hand is what God asked him to use in obedience to God.
1:52:49
to to throw down and God did miracles, signs upon what was in his hand.
1:52:57
So he was a shepherd. This was an ability God gave him as we
1:53:02
all have different abilities. And so that shepherd staff represents the ability that Moses was given by God.
1:53:10
Something God had put in his hands. And and he used it in OB. He offered it
1:53:15
to God. He offered this to God. And when he offered it to God, doing what God had asked him to do, it became supernatural.
1:53:23
It became miraculous. So using the staff how he wanted to do
1:53:29
it, peaceful, chill life as a shepherd, no persecution,
1:53:35
no resistance, nothing miraculous.
1:53:41
But that same ability using for God's kingdom to love people, to serve him in
1:53:46
his work became miraculous. This is how it is in the kingdom. for
1:53:53
everything that God has given you, every ability, every seed God's given you,
1:54:00
every gifting. When you can use these things in the world, you can use these things for your own selfish gain and
1:54:07
nothing supernatural will happen. You use those same exact things now for the kingdom of God and God does miracles
1:54:14
upon them. God leads people into salvation, leads them to be set free and
1:54:20
healed through these things he's given you when you use them in obedience to God.
1:54:26
Hallelujah. I want to give you some examples of this.
1:54:33
Um, so skills, let's talk about skills. I had edited one video in my life
1:54:42
at the time of when I first received a calling from God to be an apostle. I figured out iMovie on my own. I made a
1:54:48
little like traveling video. Super basic. I was a very extremely amateur editor. Just taught myself the most
1:54:54
basic editing skills. Fast forward to like a a couple years or so after
1:55:00
receiving the prophecy over my life and the prophecy that revival is now. My spiritual father prophesied to me and he
1:55:07
said, "The way you're going to see this word come to pass and revival break out is by is by one minute videos. I see
1:55:16
people being drawn to one minute videos. So you need to put out one minute videos and keep going like how the Israelites
1:55:22
went around the walls of Jericho until God makes the walls come down. Don't give up. Don't stop short." So this was
1:55:30
a moment that God was saying, "You have a staff in your hand. You have the ability
1:55:37
very amateur but it's something you have a brain that
1:55:42
you can teach yourself also you know new skills so use what's in your hand and so
1:55:49
I did so I started editing myself our church was very tiny did not have anyone else who could edit I started editing I
1:55:56
started putting out videos for years these videos would not increase in views following did not increase they had like
1:56:02
just a tiny handful of views. But the the day and a half before my 30th
1:56:09
birthday, um it was December 2020, God gave me this vision to put a montage
1:56:15
video of how he had moved in power the past year. I put out this 59 second video on Tik Tok and it went super
1:56:22
viral. It reached 1 million views a day and a half later on my 30th birthday and there was thousands of comments where
1:56:28
people testified of miracles they received while watching the video. people testifying they were healed while
1:56:33
watching. They had COVID symptoms and they went away. They had pain, it went away, they had anxiety, they felt
1:56:39
something left them and now they feel peace, etc. Atheists saying, "I felt power touch me when I watched this."
1:56:46
And that video was the beginnings of the walls of Jericho coming down. That video
1:56:52
w be is was the beginning of this revival breaking out to where we are now.
1:56:58
So, it came from God saying to me, "Use what's in your hand." That was my
1:57:04
shepherd's staff. I had the prophetic direction. You just like Moses was given the prophetic direction specifically to
1:57:10
do that sign with what's in his hand to throw it down and God would make it a sign. So, I threw down the editing
1:57:18
skills, bare minimum editing skills, and I kept going and God breathed upon it in
1:57:23
his perfect timing. and signs and wonders and miracles happened through that obedience.
1:57:30
If I edited videos on my own in the world, that wouldn't have happened. But doing it for God's kingdom, loving
1:57:36
people made so many miracles happen led to a revival breaking out. Glory to God.
1:57:44
So, what about your abilities? What about your giftings, your weaknesses that are just abilities? I taught more
1:57:50
on this on your divine assignment from a couple weeks ago, so you can watch that video more. But what are your abilities
1:57:57
that God is asking you to use? And he'll do miracles through them. He'll lead many people into salvation and be set
1:58:04
free through them. Let God have them. Start using them.
1:58:09
Amen. Hallelujah. Um, okay. Now I want to talk about, so
1:58:16
this is abilities. Now I want to talk about influence.
1:58:22
You all have influence. Even if it's five people, 10 people, that's great influence.
1:58:28
Some of you have much more. Some of you out in the world watching now have a huge influence. God has entrusted you
1:58:33
with many people, many followers, thousands of followers, millions of followers. And God is not asking you. God is not
1:58:41
that God did not give you that for you to hoard and use for your own gain to use for you to have a good reputation.
1:58:48
But he gave you the influence for his kingdom. [Applause]
1:58:55
Fivefold church started with about 20 people in the first year. We decreased each year for four years from 15 to 20
1:59:01
to 15 to 10 to 5 till 2 when COVID hit. And then CO hit. There was John Tall and
1:59:08
I. Many many times it's just John Tall and I. Then there would be a couple people that would stumble in the park. There'd be five. There'd be 10. There'd
1:59:14
be 20. There'd be five. There'd be three. There'd be two. There'd be F. It varied each week. And um when that
1:59:22
video went viral, people started trickling in more week by week because word started to spread. And then the
1:59:29
first deliverance took place because of that video going viral. This woman saw another video in Massachusetts. She flew
1:59:36
to LA to encounter Jesus at 5F and God delivered her from a demon. And that video went viral. That led to people
1:59:42
flocking in. It led to videos going so viral. Suddenly there was all these um people, these ministers who operated in
1:59:49
deliverance. I never even saw anybody operate in deliverance until my spiritual father. In real deliverance, I
1:59:54
saw someone I thought was deliverance, but real deliverance until my spiritual father.
2:00:00
And so all of a sudden, there's these people who operate in deliverance have deliverance ministries in America I didn't even know about they're reaching
2:00:06
out to me saying we're we support you cheering me on. I was shocked and one of them just well
2:00:13
before I share that we started growing like we got to like 20some people when
2:00:20
um that woman came that was the first demon casted out first deliverance that
2:00:26
Jesus did. We were 20some. Then we grew each week. We had like 30 the next week,
2:00:32
then like 40ome the next week, then like 50 something. So about two months passes, we grew to 80. We grew to 80
2:00:40
people. That was the most we've ever had. And just months prior, there was
2:00:45
one person in the amphitheater in the park and they left in the middle of the sermon. And now we've grown to 80. And
2:00:52
then one of the the deliverance ministers that wrote reached out in support, he invited me to be on his
2:00:58
podcast and he had many followers. And um so I did the interview on the
2:01:05
podcast and then after the at the end of the podcast he said to everyone watching,
2:01:11
you all should go go to this service. Go to a service on Sunday. This is revival.
2:01:17
You all should go and encounter God's power and be a part of this. You all should go. If those of you that are in
2:01:24
Southern California or beyond. So, he used his influence
2:01:30
to love people, to serve God. Amen. Amen. And I was so shocked
2:01:39
at the power of influence because that week, that Sunday,
2:01:47
300 people showed up and the amphitheater was overflowing.
2:01:55
And I know a big part of that was because there was this shepherd staff being used
2:02:03
by this man of giving what God had given him to to love people to really love
2:02:09
people. Not for selfish gain. Not like we're competing, wanting to hoard people to yourself, but really loving people.
2:02:18
Can you stand up if you came here because of that video?
2:02:25
Where's Myra? Is Myra, too, I think. There's some people who are here today.
2:02:33
That's how they discovered and they've been planted ever since. And they've been delivered and transformed. Glory to
2:02:38
God. And there's been so many people online who that's their story, too. But
2:02:44
from there, we just kept growing. From there, hundreds came. Before that day, it wasn't hund even 100. From that day
2:02:52
it was hundreds always every Sunday in person and then expanding online so much. But I shared to you the power of
2:02:59
influence that God has given it. It shocked me when someone will actually
2:03:05
use because it's a choice how you use your influence. But if you will love people with your
2:03:11
influence really love people. If you see that people need freedom and
2:03:16
you see freedom happening somewhere, tell your tell the people you influence,
2:03:22
your followers about where they can be free. That's loving people. That's loving God.
2:03:30
Amen. You have your own influences on social media. You should be using it completely
2:03:36
for God. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:03:43
Uh, another way that we can be loving people through our our obedience, this
2:03:48
is another staff in your hand that God will ask you to use is sharing your testimony.
2:03:55
Um, I believe that every one of you who have
2:04:00
shared a testimony, I believe that between one and thousands
2:04:07
of people have come into salvation, been set free,
2:04:14
were transformed by God's power because of your testimony.
2:04:20
Because every single week, every single week, people are testifying here of
2:04:26
miracles they've received. And many of them it's because of videos they saw, testimonies shared. Others actually
2:04:32
share. I had faith because I heard this person's testimony. I came position
2:04:37
myself where God's power is because I heard this testimony. So that's why I say I believe with all my heart that
2:04:43
every single one of you who have shared your testimony, especially if you've shared it on social media, if you've allowed 5 Church to share it, for
2:04:49
example, you've reached way more than one person. But it's not that not not just that
2:04:54
you've reached them. I mean, I'm telling you, you contributed to between one and
2:05:00
thousands of people, maybe millions, some of you, you've contributed to one to thousands or millions being saved,
2:05:07
healed, set free. equipped to be who God called them to
2:05:13
be. Isn't that powerful? Your testimony is your staff.
2:05:20
Your testimony is your staff. God is doing such wonders through your testimony. Keep sharing.
2:05:26
Keep spreading the flyers. Keep sharing the books. I'm so proud of all of you revival warriors here and around the
2:05:32
world. I'm seeing you share the flyers. share the unlock your deliverance books to people all over the place. Going out
2:05:39
and talking to people, handing flyers to them. This is loving people. This is
2:05:45
loving God. And God is using every single seed planted. I'm telling you.
2:05:50
I'm telling you, some of those people that you met personally, you handed them a fire, you shared your testimony, you
2:05:56
gave them a book, and other people you didn't see, but you left it somewhere. I'm telling you that many are saved,
2:06:01
healed, and delivered. They will be because of that act of obedience. I know with all my heart. So keep going
2:06:09
with fire and compassion for God's people. Amen.
2:06:18
And the last staff I will mention now staff that God is calling you to to use
2:06:23
and he'll do miracles through is
2:06:29
by serving in the work of God and by sewing sewing financially.
2:06:35
Um when we were small, when our church was small, the people would the people coming to the church, they would give.
2:06:40
And my parents, I would ask my parents if they could give every week for
2:06:46
uh threeish years. My parents gave. They gave more than anyone every single week
2:06:54
for three years because there wasn't enough coming in.
2:07:00
And I thank I'm so grateful to them. But like if because they were used by God in this way, the people that were there at
2:07:07
that church, including Jean Tall, Jean Tal's parents too, those sheep were able to be fed. They
2:07:14
were able to be touched. And what God was doing was able to grow to a point where God was ready for it to go viral
2:07:22
and revival to break out. because my parents and those at the
2:07:27
church at that time faithfully gave the work of God could keep going forth and
2:07:33
blossom to this re global revival we are seeing now. How powerful those seeds are in
2:07:41
those small beginnings. How powerful those seeds from those the people at the church at that time and my
2:07:46
parents. How powerful those seeds were. They were laying the bricks of found the
2:07:52
foundation of this global revival. Amen. We wouldn't be there without those seeds, without those bricks.
2:08:01
And then um about four years later, revival broke out. And okay, so first of
2:08:07
all, I want to say I counted up. I think there has been about 156 Sundays
2:08:13
services at 5F Church before revival broke out. Around there. 156. We'll say around
2:08:20
there. And so through that, my parents and those people that were giving at the time, our small group of the
2:08:27
congregation, that was a lot of Sundays they were sewing.
2:08:33
But look at the power of that. Look what it led to. Amen.
2:08:38
Now, ever since then, that's been now it's been four years since revival has broke out. And I counted there has been
2:08:44
about 208 Sundays, Sunday services where many of you and
2:08:50
some in the past and those of you watching online have swed faithfully and
2:08:55
served and have made the work of God possible for all of those Sundays. And
2:09:01
all of those Sundays, it was revival. God healed and delivered and equipped his people every single Sunday.
2:09:09
So those that that that staff in your hand of sewing and serving, God did many
2:09:16
wonders upon them every single Sunday. Hallelujah.
2:09:22
And there's been about
2:09:28
150 Revival is now events and conferences
2:09:34
ever since 2021. About 150. Wow. Wow. around the world. And at every
2:09:41
single one of them, so many people have been delivered, healed, given their lives to Jesus, been set on fire for
2:09:48
Jesus, received impartation like the testimony we shared, and now they're spreading revival. Victor, that first
2:09:54
guy, the the the gentleman we saw in there from Sweden, he didn't even know Jesus. He came to a revival is now
2:10:00
event. He met Jesus there. Jesus delivered him there of of depression and
2:10:05
other things, addiction, and set him on fire. Now he's walking in his calling
2:10:11
and receive impartation of anointing and is spreading revival in Sweden and beyond.
2:10:17
Look at how impactful and powerful just one revival is now event.
2:10:28
And about 140ish around 140 of the 150
2:10:34
events they were completely sponsored by a
2:10:40
person by about 140 different people. Some of them are here now like in Redlands.
2:10:47
Some of them is our five family from around the world. They paid for the entire event. They paid for the travel.
2:10:55
They pay for everything that is all the many different things that go into these events. There's so many different costs.
2:11:02
And so I didn't do the exact math, but I counted and I realized that last year and this year is when 5F Church started
2:11:08
to host their own events. By and large, we did a couple in the past years, just a couple. One, a couple were like in
2:11:13
parks, but before then it every single one. And and it it was people paying for
2:11:21
it all because they were loving people. They were wanting to see people healed
2:11:26
and delivered in their city, in their nation, and saved.
2:11:34
That's 140 people each giving thousands,
2:11:40
thousands each, so that these events could take place
2:11:46
and many people could encounter Jesus. I just want to share how powerful that
2:11:53
is. How powerful that is. Isn't that powerful? Do you see how
2:12:00
that's loving people?
2:12:06
I think most people mo most people who are planted now, most people who are planted,
2:12:12
they came to either 5F church in person or an event. And that was it was because people loved
2:12:21
them, loved strangers. [Music] Many people there's been there's 5F
2:12:27
church family they have funded entire revival now events like last year some of the revivals now events last year
2:12:33
they were funded completely by people who were planted who they in a different city that
2:12:39
they're not they don't even live in in a different nation.
2:12:45
This is the love God is calling you to have for his people, for people you don't even know.
2:12:53
God will do miracles, signs, and wonders upon what you use in your hand. Amen.
2:12:59
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:13:05
Thank you, Jesus. So, I uh uh Philippians 4:8, it says, "And now, dear
2:13:11
brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true and honorable and right and pure and lovely and admirable. Think about things that
2:13:17
are excellent and worthy of praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me. Everything you heard me and saw me doing, then the God
2:13:23
of peace will be with you. Jesus is uh Paul is saying here, everything you
2:13:29
heard from me and saw me doing, loving people, serving them, being about the father's business, put into practice.
2:13:36
And in the scripture, it's saying to meditate on good things, pure things.
2:13:43
Some of the things you need to be meditating on is loving people.
2:13:48
You need to be meditating on the salvation of souls. For people to be free,
2:13:55
meditate. That's how you'll be able to love people more and serve God in a
2:14:01
higher way that he's calling you to. Meditate. renew your mind of God's heart for his
2:14:09

2:19:33
Hallelujah. I want to encourage you to stand up right now.
2:19:39
God is releasing an impartation upon you all right now of more of his heart for
2:19:46
his people. More of a heart for his people.
2:19:51
You know, this is so prophetic because as I was preparing for this message and as God started to show me
2:19:57
what he was going to do today, releasing impartation in your hearts to love people, all of a
2:20:04
sudden I was reminded of a testimony that was shared last week by a our small group leader in Florida
2:20:11
by Ruth Dearis. She said that she didn't really know how to love people well. But
2:20:18
she said after the rise and shine or flourish conference, all of a sudden she
2:20:24
had this heart for people she didn't have before. It was supernatural. The anointing touched her, transformed
2:20:31
her. Impartation came upon her to have this heart. And so then God shared with
2:20:36
me this was prophesying what he was going to do today. This is going to happen for all of you
2:20:43
right now. Like what she testified, your heart is going to grow for God's people. Your heart is going to grow for
2:20:50
every single person on this earth from today. I I encourage you right now to just take a moment with God and ask him
2:20:56
for that cuz he doesn't forcefully do that. If you want that, if you want your heart to grow for his people, if you
2:21:03
want to see people as he sees, tell him that and surrender to him and and and surrender your selfish ambitions, the
2:21:11
things that are keeping you from putting people first and loving your neighbor as
2:21:16
yourself. Surrender these things.
2:21:21
[Music]
2:21:27
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. I speak right now that
2:21:34
everything that's been holding you back from loving people must come out of you
2:21:41

2:21:47

2:21:59

2:22:38

2:23:12
realities of the devil's influence upon people. May your eyes open up more to see the
2:23:17
spiritual truth. May your eyes open up more to see people with love, to have compassion for them, to have
2:23:23
understanding for them. May your eyes open up more to to to want
2:23:29

2:24:20
love for you. How much he loves you. How deeply he loves you. Because that is how you'll be able to love others is when
