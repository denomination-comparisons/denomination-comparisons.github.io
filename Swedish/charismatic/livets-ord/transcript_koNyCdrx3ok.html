[Transcription: Whsiper Medium - English]

 Good morning and welcome back, or maybe for the first time, to the Europe Conference 2025 in Uppsala.
 The conference has been going on for a few days and everything is in full swing.
 When I walked here in the morning I reflected on the fact that Uppsala was quite a holiday-sleeper,
 but that is not to say about the conference area.
 Here it is full of morning bread in the church and soon the first morning worship service will also begin.
 Earlier I have had Anders, of course, here in the studio, but now he has moved on to other tasks.
 Here is Elin Johansson, welcome, you have been in the studio but not seen.
 I have been so excited about the meetings and looking forward to what the day and the morning will hold.
 Is there something special that you have taken with you? You get an impact from every meeting, of course.
 I think it was very good, first of all, the power in the simple prayer,
 and then the favorite meeting so far for me was yesterday, Brandy Korano.
 Even when I got myself in order in the morning in the room, I started the worship service from yesterday.
 That's good, that's how you work, you need to rehearse.
 I can only agree with that, it was very nice.
 She did the difficult simple and at the same time became very challenging.
 Yes, it was a challenging prayer that I think everyone has something that distracts.
 We will get to interview her after the worship service,
 and I think we can look deeper into who she and her husband are, but also a little about the worship service yesterday.
 Exactly, we look forward to that and we will get to listen to Brandys husband this morning, John Korano.
 It's probably the first time I know that he is preaching in Sweden.
 It will be fun to see, often it is so in a couple that you complete each other.
 Brandy is pure and sharp energy and a lot of joy there, so now we really look forward to listening to John.
 But we have a lot of other things happening during the day, Elin, would you like to coach us a little through the schedule?
 Yes, we will broadcast the morning meetings and evening meetings,
 and tonight we have Ankit Sayuan from India who will come here and preach.
 We look forward to that. But if you are in the area, you will get a little more of the conference,
 because there will be a little seminar and today at 13.00 Brandy Korano will come,
 who preached last night, to hold a women's seminar.
 And then at 14.30 there will be different seminars.
 If you are in the area, you have so much more that you can come and just listen in and get in.
 And that is the seminar every day here too. And then we broadcast the morning and evening.
 Exactly. And without Elin mentioned, there is a series of activities during the day.
 The morning meeting is children's meeting, youth meeting, it is a JG meeting for those who are in the middle,
 children and youth. And there is also a large conference area, there are food trucks here.
 You can say that you will not miss anything if you come here.
 No, I was very positively surprised when I came here. It was really ... you could choose from everything.
 It is so much to see and to take in and so many wonderful people here to talk to.
 Now we do not have to advertise here, but I have eaten a very good falafel last night.
 You can recommend it.
 I can recommend it and probably a lot of others too.
 But we also want to say to you who are online, we do this because we want you to get part of as much as possible
 and maybe get some extra bonus content. And therefore we are a little bit before and after the food services here from the studio.
 We also want to encourage you to just listen to yourself. There is a series of social media you can connect to.
 If you have a prayer book and so on and just think, oh, I would so much like to be remembered in prayer,
 then it is very good to email here to Liveets Ord, bonbon.liveetsord.se.
 And then there are prayer people here who take part in your prayer book.
 And then you can expect that God will do what only He can do in your life.
 But now we hear the music, start here behind the fire, so that we will probably get the tygans to be quiet for a while.
 Yes, exactly. And you can follow these broadcasts via Facebook and via telemplay and play.kanal10.se.
 So there you can be with and follow these days and please tell someone too.
 And that Liveets Ord has the Europe conference going on and there you will be signaled when you follow the meetings.
 And if you have the opportunity, please come here too.
 I agree. Be so well-informed now, then I hope we will see you at the end of the meeting.
 We thank you, Lord. We thank you that we can lift up your name, your name is Jesus.
 Your name that is above all other names. Thank you, Jesus.

 We sing in praise of the Lord.
 We are the Lord.
 Wonderful. And the God we serve and pray to,
 He is mighty to do.
 We have sung in that we have proclaimed the name Jesus.
 And we have received so many angelic prayers.
 Let us lift these up. They are people in cancer.
 They are people who are dying, who are not free.
 Let us pray that they meet the Jesus Christ.
 Shall we do that? Stretch out your hands, stretch out your heart.
 And we pray. Lord, we thank you for coming into your face this morning.
 We are gathered in your name. And we know that you are here with us, Lord.
 And now we lift up these precious people who are represented in these good things.
 And we speak life about them. We speak medicine in your wonderful name.
 In the name of Jesus.
 We ask you, Lord, to move with this father of the family who has been in cancer.
 God, meet him in the name of Jesus.
 Heal him. Heal him in the name of Jesus.
 We ask for this mother who is dying.
 God, stretch out your hand. Move with her.
 Rejoice in her.
 Oh, the journey is new, Lord.
 Oh, the journey is new, Lord.
 We ask you for that.
 God, we thank you that you can do miracles.
 We thank you for doing this, Lord.
 Oh, Jesus Christ.
 Oh, we ask you, Lord, that you should pray, that you should be free, that you should rejoice.
 That you should be free of all these precious people.
 We thank you for that.
 God, embrace them in your love.
 Come near them right now in this moment.
 We ask you for that.
 We thank you from these knees.
 We believe in you already now.
 And many wonderful thanksgiving items.
 About your goodness, about your love, about your greatness.
 How you heal and restore and heal people.
 We thank you and we praise you for that.
 In Jesus Christ's name.
 And everyone say Amen.
 Amen. Wonderful.
 Before you sit down, turn to someone next to you and want to sign them.
 And then you are welcome to sit down.
 I hope you have had a good sleep and that you are ready for a new day.
 I am Sebastian Asklund, one of the pastors here, in the Word of Life.
 And we are so happy that every one of you who is here and every one of you who follows us online.
 I just want to encourage you to download the app, the European Conference is called that.
 There you have good control of the whole scheme.
 And there you will be able to see that for example, that we sell food out here and where the food tracks are.
 And that at 13 o'clock we have her seminar with Brandy Carano.
 And then at 14.30 o'clock there is a seminar with the theme, activate your gifts.
 And then a lot of other things happen.
 Wonderful. So download the app if you haven't already.
 Then you will be fully aware of everything that happens.
 Now I hand over to Pastor Simon Alstrand.
 I am so happy to be here with you.
 I have not been better than this, but I have totally won the lottery today.
 I feel that I have won everything possible with a lot of zeros on the lottery today.
 Do you know why?
 Because I will be able to pick up the collection of the day.
 And that is the easiest, best collection. I am so happy about that.
 Everything in this collection is just so right.
 And it is just so we.
 And you will notice that soon.
 Can you say North Macedonia?
 Okay, say it so you mean it.
 North Macedonia.
 So here.
 We are happy to have formulated something that looks like this.
 And this my friends is dynamite.
 We call this BTC.
 Sounds easy?
 Okay, that sounds stronger.
 It means Bible Training Course.
 And it is basically about eight subjects.
 About eight.
 Let's say eight and a half.
 Which is fifty hours of teaching.
 Faith teaching.
 Encouraging Bible teaching.
 Which we have created a manual of.
 Do you know why?
 We have created a manual.
 So that anyone or many more.
 Will be able to go out and teach the Word of God.
 And this is what we will do now.
 In this wonderful country.
 North Macedonia.
 It is like this.
 Three people from year course two.
 Will go out right now to the fall.
 Together with two missionaries that already have in the region.
 Will go around now.
 Right now in the fall.
 After the European conference.
 And we will show you this material in North Macedonia.
 Isn't it wonderful?
 And just like that.
 So, so, so, so.
 God's Word.
 Okay, let it come.
 And I love this.
 And we love this.
 To come to the apology expression.
 With a little, I can't say weird places.
 Because it would be the task towards North Macedonia.
 But you understand.
 We love to be there.
 To travel.
 New people.
 Believing.
 And we often work through Bible schools.
 So what we will do is send out these five people now.
 Who will hammer out this teaching.
 And we aim at 20 places to start with.
 Isn't that good?
 Because what we want to do is to.
 In the spring.
 In January we aim at.
 To start a full-time Bible school in North Macedonia.
 I love this.
 And we love this.
 Because we love to be a proud people of God.
 We love to preach the Bible.
 We believe that God's Word is alive and effective.
 But we also love to be at some special places.
 Where the Gospel has not yet been completely broken through.
 So that's why I say.
 This is just so right.
 It's so right in every way.
 There is so much we and we look forward to.
 To do this.
 But you also know where I am going.
 In the spring.
 I heard you Torger.
 I heard you in your ear.
 We are going to take up a collection of this.
 And we want to take up a volunteer collection.
 Because we just want to do this.
 And go all in on this.
 To preach the Word in this region.
 So we are going to take up today's collection.
 Simply to this work in North Macedonia.
 Where we want the Bible teaching to break through.
 And we want to see in Jesus name.
 New communities.
 And we want to see the Bible teaching to be broken through.
 And we want to see in Jesus name.
 New communities in this region.
 Right?
 Can we believe in God?
 Can you and your Bible believe in God?
 Come on.
 I think we should do something beautiful in this region.
 And that a whole gang should work.
 To start with these five people.
 Can we not just pray for this.
 And then we are going to take up the collection.
 Father we thank you.
 We thank you for the courage.
 To get to get in this way.
 In this region.
 And just teach your Word.
 And preach your Word.
 Father we thank you.
 Because we know that we are not special.
 But your Word is powerful.
 Your Word is alive and effective.
 And can transform people's lives.
 So Father we thank you for these BTC courses.
 That we are going to start with.
 And we thank you for this Bible school.
 That will grow in this region.
 We thank you for it to bear.
 And we thank you for this rich and existing fruit.
 That fruit that is in your name.
 We thank you for it.
 Jesus name. Amen.
 Friends you can join us today.
 And then you can give us information.
 Behind my back.
 You can give us a swish.
 It goes super good.
 Or a whip like you in Norway.
 We have a lot of Norwegians here.
 Or you can give us a donation.
 If you want to.
 But then you do the work of God.
 And then at the end.
 Through these two exits.
 There are meeting points.
 That can receive donations.
 But be very happy to join us.
 Through swish and whip.
 If you are with us online.
 You can also be part of this.
 Give via swish via whip.
 But also via the instructions.
 If you press on give a donation.
 You will find more information.
 But God bless you.
 Let us do this together.
 I don't believe in money.
 I believe in new meetings.
 And fruit that exists.
 Can we do that? Amen.
 There is a lot happening in the world right now.
 I mean.
 It's dark out there.
 So much uncertainty.
 It's just becoming more and more obvious.
 We can't put our trust in this world.
 Not everyone can.
 But we can.
 And we can't just leave it.
 We can't just leave it.
 We can't just leave it.
 We can't just leave it.
 We can't just leave it.
 We can't just leave it.
 We can't put our trust in this world.
 Not in systems.
 Not in leaders.
 Not in trends that change overnight.
 Because everything is shaken.
 So the hope for this world.
 Must be a people who build their lives upon the only thing that will remain the same forever.
 The word of God.
 Moses, David, Esther, Paul.
 They were called for their time.
 I mean.
 This is my time.
 Our time.
 Right now.
 Is our moment to grow.
 Now.
 Is our moment to learn.
 Now is.
 Now is the time to go out.
 I truly believe.
 Jesus holds this world in his hands.
 And his hands.
 They are you and me.
 They are you and me.
 Solid.
 Strong hands.
 Hands that bring peace in the storm.
 Love where there is hate.
 And light where there is darkness.
 A people built on the word of God.
 God invested his son just to know me.
 So why wouldn't I invest a year to know him?
 For myself.
 And for the world.
 It is worth to invest a year in growing in the relationship with God.
 My name is T. Hamre.
 I work at the Bible school.
 And with me I have Torgjus.
 Who is one of the favorite teachers at the Bible school.
 And we are here because we believe.
 That you should go to the Bible school.
 If you haven't already.
 Then it is something that is worth to invest.
 It is both a year.
 Where you get to learn a lot of new people.
 From all over the world.
 You get to grow in your gifts.
 And you get to go on a lot of exciting adventures.
 But it is also an investment.
 That we can do.
 And that is why we are here.
 Because we believe.
 That you should go to the Bible school.
 But it is also an investment.
 That is worth to invest.
 And that is worth to carry out.
 I went to the Bible school.
 For like nine years.
 It was a little more years.
 Than you went to the Bible school.
 How is that?
 I don't mean that you are old.
 You are about the same age as the one who was.
 But how has that changed your life?
 How has that changed your life?
 The Bible school is about.
 Education.
 To train teachers.
 I got a problem here.
 When I was preparing to talk about the Bible school.
 Because I felt that I got a prophetic message.
 That I had to share.
 And that became a real distraction.
 In what I am going to say now.
 So I have to take that first.
 But the holy one says.
 So clearly. He is a witness.
 And he has said that our Bible school.
 The word of life.
 The body of Christ.
 Is on the way to a freedom.
 That we have never seen before.
 And just like the pastor John.
 Went before Jesus.
 So that people could receive Jesus.
 So prepare a holy one.
 So that we can receive.
 Everything he has to give.
 And the Bible school is of course.
 A tool in this.
 But that means that we have to receive.
 From the spirit.
 From his presence.
 Aggressive.
 That is one of my words.
 Aggressive.
 Take him in.
 So that we don't miss.
 What we are on our way to.
 We are on our way to see.
 Christ in body.
 In the fullness of Jesus service.
 In that love.
 In that power.
 And in that presence.
 Amen.
 I have a thank you message.
 In tongues.
 That I will give.
 And hopefully mean.
 And a prophetic word.
 And then I will tell you more about the Bible school.
 But can we do so that we just all.
 Blunt.
 I have never sung in tongues.
 Any songs.
 Is.
 You really DEAL.
 My man.
 We were the lucky.
 Happy.
 Supposing.
 So raza.
 A loving a lot.
 Fear my so.
 I'm not sad.
 Watching at the cargo.
 Halper.
 remained.
 Son.
 It's individual, it's to the Bible schools, it's to the meeting, it's to the Christian body.
 Everyone who accepts.
 I bow to you Jesus. We bow to you Jesus Christ. You are exalted. We offer you, we honor you.
 You are the creator of heaven and earth. You are the highest. You are the greatest.
 We exalt you Jesus. You are the greatest. You are the greatest. You are the greatest.
 You are the greatest. We exalt you Jesus. We honor you Jesus. We honor you Jesus.
 It was a thank you speech and here comes the prophecy.
 So the Lord says, it's time to come near me. It's time to not go away anymore.
 It's time to come into my presence. It's time to rise up to me and meet me.
 It's time to rise up so that I can come in. I still see that I stand by the door and knock.
 And it's about you. It's about your gatherings. It's about your families. It's about your jobs.
 So open up. So open up. But you say, what have we closed you out of here? We want you. What have we closed you out of?
 The idea that you walk in your own strength. The idea that you walk in your own strength. You close me out.
 But if you want to open up, I will come into your garden, your soul, your gathering, your gatherings with strength.
 I will walk in your garden so that the trees will bloom, the ground will bloom.
 It will bear fruit because you open up to me. So don't say it's not for me.
 Don't say that you don't dare. Open up. Say yes, Lord. Yes, Lord, I open up for you. Yes, Lord, we open up for you.
 So that you can get your will. So that you can get your way. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Amen.
 Amen. Amen.
 When I came to the Bible School 32 years ago, I was so hungry to become a disciple.
 And as I usually say, to become a Christian for real.
 And the Bible School has been a fantastic gift to me.
 Even though I remember so well when I went to the first grade, it was also super hard.
 Because I came under this strong conviction, under God's word.
 And it was so challenging that a lot of the year I had a fight with such darkness in my soul.
 I was completely determined, I am Norwegian, I was completely determined that I should only be one year in this country.
 A maximum of one year in Sweden.
 At the end of the Bible School, I experienced that the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said,
 You must go second, so that you can start to get into what you have heard during the first year.
 Yes, sir.
 And that is really the witness point about my life and what the Bible School means to me.
 Because that is what always comes back.
 That the Bible School is not for one year or two years, but it is for a life in teaching and in following Jesus.
 To be trained, to be trained, but that is not done in one year.
 It is all life. All life.
 And that is what he always witnesses to me.
 If you can take me in your work, in the service you are in, in the family you are in,
 you will see that it is all that you heard at the Bible School that time.
 But it is a process and it is a whole life.
 I think there are people here, and people who listen, who the Holy Spirit tries to capture your attention.
 He challenges you to take a step in faith.
 Dare, even if not everything is in place, maybe with work and housing, it may look difficult.
 But ask this question when Jesus says, follow me, so I will make you a fisherman and ask him how can I follow you?
 If he points at the Bible School, then dare, dare to take that step.
 I think there are many who have gone to the Bible School who did it without any expectations for it,
 neither economically nor otherwise.
 But it has been done.
 It has been done.
 I just challenge and I also do a lot to our own young people here in the congregation in the church.
 I also do a lot to our own young people here in the congregation.
 Come and go to the Bible School.
 We have received the witness offering again from our own young people that they are shocked.

 How many were here yesterday and were blessed by Brandy Corranus during the show?
 That was so, so good!
 And we are so happy that we also have her husband, John Corranus with us.
 Together they lead the International Church of Barcelona.
 They have such growth there and we are so happy.
 They are really friends to us.
 Good morning!
 Good morning!
 Good morning!
 Before you see the turn to someone near you,
 tell them hello in whatever language you learned first.
 And you may be seated.
 Man, it's so good to be here.
 Brandy has been with you many times.
 I think this is number five or six maybe.
 I snuck with her last time.
 Just to worship, to be present.
 But thanks for the invitation to come and share.
 It's been a beautiful time so far.
 Beautiful time in worship.
 Powerful messages.
 Brandy, thank you for your message last night.
 I don't just say that because she is my wife.
 Or because I get to be her husband.
 It was a prophetic word at just the right time.
 I know there's going to be more messages tonight than tomorrow and this weekend.
 Moments of prayer.
 Where the Holy Spirit is inviting us to trust him.
 I want you to do me a favor.
 I want you to take notes.
 If you have pen and paper,
 Well done.
 If you don't have pen and paper,
 Or don't know what that means,
 Get out your phone,
 Or write it on your friend's arm.
 Here's what we know.
 If we do not write down what we hear,
 We're not going to remember.
 And if we don't remember,
 We cannot put it into practice.
 And what I don't want to do,
 Is talk about the things of God,
 And forget about it when we walk out the door.
 I want you to wrestle with it this week.
 I want you to be bothered by it this week.
 I want us to be changed this week.
 I love worship.
 But I am not a singer.
 My daughter is a singer.
 She writes worship and sings.
 I sing very loud,
 But not very good.
 If you were sitting near me,
 I'm sorry about that.
 Because I do what the Bible says.
 I make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
 I make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
 I know that I've been redeemed.
 I know that I've been redeemed.
 I have friends at our church
 I have friends at our church
 that lead worship.
 And I said, I'm so glad
 that the music is so loud
 so you can't hear me.
 And they said, oh, we hear you.
 I was recently at a very small church
 in a very country setting.
 In a very country setting.
 Rural setting.
 In the country.
 And I sang the same way I sing here.
 And afterwards someone said to me,
 will you stay and join the choir?
 Will you stay and join the choir?
 So, will you stay and join our choir?
 All that means is I'm loud.
 It just means that I have a high voice.
 I'm not an artist.
 But I love art.
 In my office I have some art.
 In our home we have some art.
 Brandy has decided that we love art.
 Brandy has decided that we love art.
 And so, gentlemen, this is yes.
 Up and now, ready, go.
 We love art.
 But I don't understand art.
 I don't know that you're supposed to understand art.
 But we have art.
 I went several years ago with a friend of mine
 to an art gala.
 I don't know how to say gala in Swedish.
 But when we sing songs in Swedish,
 I sing as loud as I can.
 But I have no idea what I'm saying.
 Except, thank Jesus.
 But I don't know about art.
 But my friend said, come with me to my art party.
 And I said, will there be food?
 And he said, there will be fika.
 Well, he didn't know fika, but there was food.
 And I went with him.
 My plate full of food.
 And we would walk from art to art to art.
 And he would say, John.
 What do you think?
 And I would say, mmm.
 What do you think?
 And he would say, it speaks to me.
 And I said, it speaks to me too.
 When I said, it speaks to me too.
 I'm just not sure what it's saying yet.
 We went through the whole night.
 At the end of it, he said to me,
 my studio is not far.
 Do you want to see more of my art?
 To which the right response was yes.
 And so we went.
 We got to his studio,
 and I saw many works of art.
 Some were still in progress.
 Some were finished.
 But I noticed in the corner,
 there was one that seemed hidden.
 It had a sheet, a blanket over it.
 And I said, what's that?
 It's a sheet.
 And I said, what's that?
 And I said, what's that?
 Because I'm always curious.
 And he said, well that one needs some work.
 And I went over and I picked it up.
 I set it on the easel,
 like Brandy had here last night.
 And I uncovered it.
 It was beautiful,
 but it was broken.
 It was dirty.
 And it had a big hole right in the middle of it.
 And I said, oh what a shame!
 It's broken.
 It's filthy.
 This one needs to be thrown away.
 And he said, you think so?
 And I said, I don't know art.
 But I know this one is not good.
 And he said, you have a little more time.
 And I said, yeah I'm full.
 I eat lots of food.
 I eat lots of food.
 He put on his apron,
 and he set the art on his table.
 And he set the art on his table.
 He took needle and thread,
 and began to sew the canvas.
 He began to repair the hole in the middle of it.
 He then took plaster,
 and began to cover where the hole had been.
 He then took sandpaper,
 and he began to sand the entire work of art.
 Making it smooth again.
 He then placed it on the easel.
 And he began to cover it with sandpaper.
 And he began to cover it with sandpaper.
 He then placed it on the easel.
 And he took white paint,
 dipped his brush in the paint,
 and began to make the canvas white again.
 And he said, John, what you think has no future
 will be my greatest work of art yet.
 Because I'm making this new,
 and I have a plan.
 My friend, with every move of his sewing,
 with every brush stroke that he put on that canvas,
 the Holy Spirit spoke to me.
 And he said, John, I make all things new.
 In the hands of the master artist,
 I make all things new.
 I don't know how you've come here today.
 Maybe you've been carrying something that's too heavy.
 Maybe you feel as though there's a wound or a hole
 in your heart or in your soul.
 Maybe there's a problem in your life that seems too big.
 But here's what I know.
 You have a problem in your life that seems too big.
 But here's what I know.
 You are not here by accident.
 You and I were not here
 just because there's a conference.
 Though that's kind of why we're here.
 You're not here because a friend invited you.
 You're not here because you had nothing better to do.
 Even if all those things are true.
 You are here because the master artist knows you.
 Because he has a plan for you.
 Because he's not done with you.
 And because in your life and mine,
 in his hands, he wants to do something new today.
 Will you let him?
 In Barcelona,
 I pray this prayer every single week.
 God, we come to you with open hands and open hearts.
 Open hands is a symbol of I'm letting go.
 Of control.
 Of my plans.
 Of my strength.
 Of my thoughts.
 And I'm ready to receive what you have for me.
 So here's what I want you to do.
 If you're comfortable,
 open your hands in front of you.
 If you're not comfortable,
 open your hands in front of you.
 Jesus,
 we come to you right now.
 Not because we have it all figured out.
 But because we do not.
 We come to you,
 not having all the answers,
 but we come to you today
 in a posture of humble surrender.
 Saying we need you.
 We know that you are the master artist.
 We know that you have a plan.
 And we want you to do it in us today.
 For those of us that have known you,
 make us uncomfortable.
 Make us uncomfortable.
 Take us to deeper waters.
 For those of us that are new to the family,
 remind us
 that we are your sons and daughters.
 And for those that are here today,
 we're joining online.
 Wondering if you're real.
 If there is truth to all of this,
 I pray that you would do something in heart and soul.
 That is undeniable.
 May we know we've been with you.
 And would you give us the courage to trust you.
 Open hands.
 And open hearts.
 In Jesus' name we pray.
 Amen.
 Today as we're jumping into Scripture,
 we're going to 1 Samuel chapter 14.
 And I've titled the message today.
 Let's go!
 Let's go!
 See, there was an invitation from Jesus.
 Come and follow me.
 That invitation has never changed.
 As we look to 1 Samuel 14,
 there will be an invitation from Jesus.
 Come and follow me.
 There will be an invitation from Jonathan.
 Let's go!
 And here's what I know to be true today.
 There is an invitation of the Holy Spirit
 for you and for me
 that echoes the same words
 through the generations.
 Let's go!
 We jump into 1 Samuel 14.
 We see that Saul is the first king
 that Israel has ever had.
 And he's admired by the people at first.
 He's tall.
 He's good looking.
 He's charismatic.
 Like Pastor David.
 He's a good looking man.
 He's a good looking man.
 People are drawn to him.
 But unlike your pastor,
 he had some problems.
 He didn't realize to surrender.
 He didn't realize
 to let go
 and to trust.
 And there's this army of the people
 called the Philistines
 that come against Israel
 and they come to attack them.
 And God speaks to the prophet.
 God gives word to his king, Saul.
 And he says,
 Come out to battle.
 I am with you.
 How many of us would love to know
 that God said, step out.
 That God said, step out.
 I'm with you.
 It would bring so much comfort, right?
 I have so many conversations
 where people say, I just wish I knew
 that God was saying go.
 That he was saying now.
 That he was saying, I've got you.
 Friends, he has not changed.
 And today he's saying, let's go.
 But Saul
 heard this message
 and decided to do something different.
 Saul
 does not go into battle.
 Instead he says that he goes
 with his army.
 He sits under a tree
 How many of you love good shade under a tree?
 And he falls asleep.
 Now listen, in Spain we have siesta.
 You don't have siesta
 because you're doing your seventh fika.
 But in Spain we still have siesta.
 But in Spain we still have siesta.
 But in Spain we still have siesta.
 Saul is taking a siesta.
 He's taking his nap.
 There's a call of God.
 I'm calling you out.
 There's an invitation of God.
 Let's go, I'm with you.
 And his response
 is to sleep.
 If I'm honest with you today
 many times we are no different than Saul.
 We've received a call.
 God has spoken.
 He has said I am with you.
 He's given the invitation.
 Let's go!
 And we fall asleep.
 We sit down
 in a place that is comfortable
 and we do not move
 and we mask it with spirituality.
 I'm just waiting on the Lord.
 Now wait.
 There are moments to wait on the Lord.
 There are moments to be still
 and know He is God.
 There are moments when the most
 spiritual thing we can do
 is rest in Him.
 And often that is not us.
 Saul was supposed to be in the battle.
 He was sleeping under the tree.
 And Jonathan, his son
 is watching this.
 God's with us.
 Army's with us.
 We're ready to go.
 And when dad's asleep
 the king's asleep
 the army's asleep.
 But Jonathan has this holy unrest.
 A dissatisfaction.
 This is not right.
 This cannot be.
 God said let's go.
 And he said let's go.
 And one man
 heard him
 his armor bearer
 and said I am with you.
 Let's do it.
 So the two of them go across the field.
 They go before where the army
 is encamped.
 And I can just see this playing out, right?
 His armor bearer is like
 do you know what you're doing?
 Of course, Jonathan's response is no.
 And he says here's what we're going to do.
 We know God said go
 so we're going to go right in front of the enemy.
 And we're going to stand there.
 And if they say stay
 we will stay.
 And if they say come up here
 we'll go up.
 Because we know God will be with us.
 Perhaps he'll meet us there.
 Many people read this from Jonathan's perspective.
 I love this armor bearer.
 Because he says
 I'm with you heart and soul.
 I would have been like what?
 This is not good strategy.
 I've seen a lot of movies.
 This is not how they win the battle.
 This is how they die in early death.
 And no one remembers them.
 This is a bad plan.
 But Jonathan knows God said let's go.
 And the armor bearer says
 I trust your faith.
 I trust your faith.
 I trust your faith.
 I trust God's word.
 And I'm going to step out with you.
 Let's do it.
 Today we're talking about activating our purpose.
 And the invitation.
 Let's go.
 So we're going to look at three things quickly.
 That will help us follow this invitation. Let's go.
 Write these down.
 Letμο tο theTeam
 Let's go to the right places.
 Let's go with the right people.
 And let's go with the perhaps.
 Let's go to the right places.
 Let's go with the right people.
 Let's go with the perhaps.
 Number one.
 To the right places.
 Have you ever been in the wrong place?
 At the wrong time.
 Have you ever been in the wrong place at the wrong time?
 If you do.
 Or if you have.
 You know what that feels like.
 There have been many times in my life I've been in the right place at the right time.
 And the girl said yes.
 And the girl said yes.
 And the girl said yes.
 There have been many times.
 When I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 And I knew it in the moment.
 And the Holy Spirit said, what are you doing here?
 And the Holy Spirit said, what are you doing here?
 Times when I felt it in my soul.
 Times when I was attacked in my body.
 But I knew that I was not in the right place.
 But I knew that I was not in the right place.
 As we follow this invitation of the Holy Spirit.
 Let's go.
 We've got to go to the right places.
 Now sometimes the right places are actually places.
 And sometimes they are postures.
 And sometimes they are postures.
 Sometimes you know you should not be where your feet are taking you.
 Sometimes you know you should not be where your feet are taking you.
 In my experience.
 In my experience.
 There's always a moment.
 When we live with open hands and an open heart.
 That the Holy Spirit says stop.
 Don't go.
 This is not my plan.
 Turn back. Close your eyes.
 Turn it off.
 And we have a decision to make.
 Go to the wrong place.
 Or trust the voice of God.
 Friends there have been so many times.
 That I've made the right decision.
 And there have been too many times.
 When I say that's just me.
 I'll keep going.
 I just keep going.
 And I'm in the wrong place.
 Sometimes when Brandy will say are you sure?
 Sometimes it's yes.
 Sometimes it's no.
 Where is your path taking you today?
 Where is your path taking you today?
 This invitation is to go to the right places.
 To live with the right posture of trust and faith.
 To live with the right posture of trust and faith.
 To live with the right posture of trust and faith.
 Saul knew the right place.
 Saul knew the right place.
 And when he got to the right place.
 He did the wrong thing.
 He went and sat under a tree.
 And fell asleep.
 I submit to you today.
 That many of us.
 Are asleep under a tree.
 That we've been invited.
 To step out in faith.
 To activate our purpose.
 To go.
 And then we get so close.
 But we sit down.
 And we fall asleep under a tree.
 And they say to me John.
 I'm not doing anything wrong.
 I'm not living in sin.
 I'm not doing anything wrong.
 I would submit to us today.
 That it is entirely possible.
 To be doing nothing wrong.
 But to be doing nothing great.
 It's entirely possible.
 Not to be living a life of full on sin.
 But to not be doing anything great.
 But to not be doing anything great.
 And we fool ourselves.
 But really we're asleep under a tree.
 Often that comes.
 In the form of comfort.
 God has blessed us.
 We've seen some success.
 We've seen the beauty of His favor and His goodness.
 But then we get comfortable.
 We sit down in the shade of that tree.
 And we no longer advance when He calls us to advance.
 One of the greatest tools of the enemy.
 Doesn't have to be to get you to sin.
 It's not that we're not going to sin.
 It's that we're not going to sin.
 It's that we're not going to sin.
 It doesn't have to be to get you to sin.
 He just lulls you to a place of comfort.
 Where you fall asleep under the tree.
 Where you fall asleep under the tree.
 And you're doing nothing really wrong.
 But you're doing nothing great.
 But you're doing nothing great.
 Purpose cannot live where comfort reigns.
 Purpose cannot live where comfort reigns.
 Purpose will not live where comfort reigns.
 Purpose will not live where comfort reigns.
 Let's go.
 Let's go to the right places.
 With open hands and open hearts of surrender.
 That say where you lead me I will follow.
 That say where you lead me I will follow.
 Saul was the right man.
 At the right time.
 That went to the wrong place.
 And because of that God used someone else.
 Go to the right place.
 Go to the right place.
 The second thing we see is that we go with the right people.
 Jonathan sees his father sitting there asleep.
 Jonathan sees his father sitting there asleep.
 And he is bothered.
 And he is bothered.
 And he is bothered.
 And he looks at his armor bearer.
 Who is not there because he wants to be.
 It is his job.
 It is his mandate.
 It is his responsibility.
 But he still could have run.
 But he still could have run.
 And Jonathan looks at him and says.
 God has called us.
 Let's go start this fight.
 I would have said.
 You're insane.
 Have you asked your dad?
 Let's find the priest.
 And do an offering.
 Let's ask GPD.
 Let's just make sure that we make sure that we make sure.
 Before we go.
 But he doesn't say that.
 He says whatever you have in heart and soul.
 I am with you.
 He was the right people.
 Have you ever been around someone.
 That had a bad attitude.
 That everything that came out of their mouth.
 That everything that came out of their mouth.
 Was all the reasons why it would not work.
 Was all the reasons why it would not work.
 It would have made sense.
 It would have made sense.
 For his armor bearer to say.
 This doesn't make sense.
 There's not enough of us.
 There's an army over there.
 Let's make a new plan.
 But he understood the moment he was in.
 He understood. God had already said let's go.
 And he said I am with you heart and soul.
 And he said I am with you heart and soul.
 Where God leads you.
 I'm with you.
 Let's do it. Let's go.
 I'm one of eight children.
 I have six sisters.
 Prayers appreciated.
 Because what that means.
 Is I had seven mothers growing up.
 I remember when I was about six years old.
 I got home from school.
 My mom was a great mom.
 And she said go change.
 Go put your backpacks away.
 I'll make you a snack.
 And come back.
 I ran down the hall.
 I kicked off my fake Converse.
 Because with eight kids we were very poor.
 It flew through my room.
 It hit my dresser.
 Fell on the floor.
 I kicked off my second shoe.
 Baby blue in color.
 I still remember it.
 It flew through my room.
 And straight through my bedroom window.
 The window was closed.
 All I heard was crash.
 And glass falling everywhere.
 Now my mom was from Texas in the United States.
 My father was in Texas.
 And he was in Texas.
 And here's what I knew in this moment.
 She's gonna kill me.
 This is the day I see Jesus.
 So I did the only thing that made sense.
 I ran into my room.
 I dove under my bed.
 I pulled the curtain.
 I ran up the stairs.
 I ran up the stairs.
 I dove under my bed.
 I pulled all my toys around me.
 And I hid.
 And I remember one of my sisters.
 Came to find me.
 John, what's taking you so long?
 And she walked in my room.
 Saw the broken window.
 And replied.
 At that point if you have eight brothers and sisters.
 At that point if you have eight brothers and sisters.
 They all come running.
 So a big group of people came to my room.
 My mama came in.
 And I'm hiding as far as I can in the corner.
 And I'm hiding as far as I can in the corner.
 The same sister looked under the bed.
 Where's John?
 She didn't see me.
 She's a little blind.
 They looked out the window.
 Did he fall?
 Then they went downstairs because they couldn't find me.
 And they began to search.
 Now this was Naples, Italy.
 In the 1980s.
 So they're knocking on the trunk of cars.
 And John, are you in there?
 John, are you in there?
 One hour passes.
 And no one finds me.
 And I fell asleep.
 I was tired.
 I was tired.
 It takes a lot of energy to hide.
 They're freaking out.
 They're freaking out.
 My mother is terrified.
 And my oldest sister
 goes back to the room to look one more time.
 She looks under the bed again.
 And somehow she sees me.
 I wake up
 being pulled out from under the bed.
 I'm awakened by
 I found him.
 And again I knew.
 This is it.
 I had a good rest.
 Before I see Jesus.
 But Lord, into your hands I commit my spirit.
 I thought my mom would kill me.
 I had a crowd
 surrounding this execution.
 My mother sat on the edge of the bed.
 My sibling is wondering how will he die.
 And she threw her arms around me.
 And she said, I'm so glad you're safe.
 I'm so glad you're okay.
 You're back where you belong.
 They were my people.
 They didn't let me stay.
 They didn't let me die.
 They were my people.
 They didn't let me stay lost.
 They didn't let me stay asleep.
 They didn't let me stay hidden.
 They pulled me out.
 They woke me up.
 They drew me close.
 And they said, we're so glad you're home.
 Be with the right people.
 Go with the right people.
 If the people in your life
 are discouraging you from God's call
 from God's invitation
 from stepping out in faith
 from trusting the one who is and was and is to come
 from trusting the one who is and was and is to come
 from trusting the one who is and was and is to come
 may I submit to you
 may I submit to you
 they might not be the right people.
 They might not be the right people for the season God has you in
 and for where he is calling you.
 and for where he is calling you.
 Let's go to the right places.
 Let's go with the right people.
 That does not mean
 that they have to lie to you.
 Brandy is a master realist.
 Brandy is a master realist.
 And I am a master dreamer.
 What Brandy does not try to do
 She does not try to tell me
 we shouldn't dream.
 Sometimes she says, wow that's going to be complicated.
 You might not understand all the work you will take.
 You might not understand all the work you will take.
 But I am with you heart and soul.
 But I am with you heart and soul.
 It might look dangerous up ahead.
 Have you counted the cost?
 But I am with you heart and soul.
 Those that should go with us
 will be with us heart and soul.
 And Jonathan and his armor bearer
 And Jonathan and his armor bearer
 go to that moment.
 And they are the right people for the right moment.
 The right people
 don't just agree with your dream.
 They walk with you through the battle.
 They walk with you through the battle.
 They won't just settle.
 They'll fight with you.
 They'll believe with you.
 And then number three.
 Let's go!
 Go with the perhaps.
 Verse 13 it says that Jonathan
 and his armor bearer they go to the cliff.
 And the enemy says come on up!
 And the enemy says come on up!
 We're going to teach you a lesson.
 Jonathan turns to his armor bearer
 and says yes!
 Let's do this, God's with us.
 Perhaps God will meet us at the top.
 And it says he climbs the cliff
 and the Bible says using his hands and his feet.
 Now this is not by accident.
 If it says he's climbing with his hands and feet
 If it says he's climbing with his hands and feet
 Guess where his sword is?
 Not in his hands.
 Not in his hands.
 Maybe he was on his side.
 I think he was on his back.
 But he's climbing hands and feet.
 Control of what will happen
 is out of his hands.
 Control of what will happen.
 Control of what will happen
 is out of his hands.
 If he had tried to climb
 with two feet and one hand and one sword
 he would have fallen to his death.
 He would have fallen to his death.
 This was complete reliance.
 This was full trust in God.
 You said go.
 Perhaps you will meet us like this.
 I would love to tell you
 that you will know exactly what to do
 in the moment you're supposed to do it.
 And God will send you a PDF
 with a strategic plan
 and a budget
 and a timeline.
 And you'll go, that makes sense.
 So thank you Jesus.
 But can I be honest with you?
 He's not going to do it.
 Because that would put it back in our hands.
 Control in our hands.
 And the invitation
 is to step into the perhaps.
 Here's how faith works.
 I think so.
 I trust you.
 And then he comes near to us.
 The Bible says that when we draw near to him
 he what?
 Draws near to us.
 There have been so many times in my life
 when I sense the calling of God.
 The leading of God.
 And I step towards him
 and we don't keep going that direction.
 So many times I step in faith, I trust you.
 And I sense the sweet spirit of God.
 Going, aww, that's cute.
 We're actually going this way.
 But it takes that first step of faith
 and surrender
 for him to redirect our paths.
 And we don't keep going that direction.
 Jonathan didn't just have a thought.
 He didn't just post a good idea on social media.
 Jonathan climbed.
 He climbed.
 Faith is not passive.
 It climbs.
 It counts the cost.
 It moves forward.
 But I want you to understand this.
 God does not bless
 what you are thinking about.
 God does not bless
 what you are thinking about.
 He will bless
 and he will meet you
 when you take a step towards him.
 When you take a step towards him.
 Let's go
 in the right direction.
 So what happens?
 Jonathan climbs.
 His armor bearer behind him.
 And he says, get to the top of the hill.
 Jonathan takes out his sword
 and begins to fight.
 And the Bible says, in that moment
 God shook the earth.
 The earth trembled.
 Guess what it did not do when Saul was asleep.
 Guess what it did not do
 when they were standing still.
 But Jonathan steps into the perhaps.
 But Jonathan steps into the perhaps.
 The spirit of God shakes the earth.
 And the enemy army begins to fight themselves.
 And the enemy army begins to fight themselves.
 Jonathan fights in what he can do.
 But the Holy Spirit meets him in the perhaps.
 But the Holy Spirit meets him in the perhaps.
 And it says the army begins to run.
 And it says the army begins to run.
 They begin to win.
 And Saul wakes up.
 And he goes, what? What's happening?
 What's this fight? What's this battle?
 Who's not here?
 And the generals look.
 Everyone's where they're supposed to be.
 Except for Jonathan, your son
 and his armor bearer.
 It was the catalyst
 that propelled the army into battle.
 It was the catalyst
 that propelled the army into battle.
 The spark
 that actually won the battle God had already promised.
 See, when you step into the perhaps
 See, when you step into the perhaps
 maybe it's an obedience of what God's told you.
 But it will also call to and inspire those who are asleep.
 But it will also call to and inspire those who are asleep.
 To wake up
 and to step into the battle where he has called them as well.
 Let's go!
 Let's go to the right places.
 Let's go
 with the right people.
 And let's go with the perhaps.
 I want to invite the band to come.
 In just a moment we're going to pray.
 And I want you to be so raw and honest with God.
 And I want you to be so raw and honest with God.
 Because he already knows what's going on in your heart and in your mind.
 Because he already knows what's going on in your heart and in your mind.
 He already knows where he's called you.
 And he already knows where you've been asleep.
 But this is an invitation to a new day.
 But here's what I want you to know.
 You don't have to go alone.
 He is with you.
 Recently I was in Barcelona.
 And in Barcelona the summers are very hot.
 It's hot here right now.
 But it still feels good.
 In Barcelona, in the summer,
 it's like someone left the door to hell wide open.
 And the heat just comes in.
 And the heat just comes in.
 And all we can do is pray for autumn.
 The fall.
 And we have a bug in Barcelona.
 That I don't think you have here.
 That I don't think you have here.
 In English it's called a cockroach.
 You've seen it in movies.
 It is the most disgusting thing you've ever seen in your life.
 They are fast.
 And they are nasty.
 And one night John John, our eight year old,
 came in and said, Dad,
 I need to go to my room.
 Now we live in an apartment in downtown Barcelona.
 With a very long hall that goes all the way down.
 And I said, women, go to your room.
 And he said, I'm afraid.
 And he said, I'm afraid, I don't want to go.
 And I said, why don't you want to go?
 He said, Dad, there are monsters in the dark.
 And I said, you can go home.
 And I said, that's crazy.
 There's no such thing as monsters.
 And he said, I think there is.
 And I said, look, how about this.
 I'll go with you.
 And I will prove to you
 that there are no monsters in the dark.
 We had left some of the windows open.
 And in the summer with the windows open,
 sometimes things in a city sneak into your house.
 And I took him by the hand.
 And we're walking down the hall.
 And I was explaining to him why it's going to be okay.
 You're overreacting.
 There's no such thing as monsters.
 And right as we passed the door to our kitchen,
 where the window had been open,
 the biggest cockroach I've ever seen in my life
 ran right in front of us.
 Stopped and stared at us.
 And John John replied,
 And I replied,
 And he looks at me,
 the most serious face he could.
 And he said, see,
 I told you there are monsters in the dark.
 We did what must be done.
 We took care of the cockroach.
 We went forward.
 And I looked at him and I said, John John,
 You're right.
 There are some monsters in the dark.
 But I'll be with you the rest of the way.
 Take my hand.
 Let's go!
 I'm not here today.
 To tell you there's no monsters in the dark.
 There are some monsters in the dark.
 But what I'm here to tell you
 is that you have a loving father
 that is inviting you today
 to take him by the hand
 to accept his invitation. Let's go!
 To the right places,
 with the right people,
 and to give you safe passage wherever it is he leads you.
 And in faith,
 to experience where he's leading you.
 You have an invitation.
 Let's go!
 The right place,
 the right people,
 with the perhaps.
 Close your eyes for just a minute.
 In just a moment I'm going to give an invitation to respond.
 What does it look like to respond?
 Maybe it's to forgive someone.
 Maybe that perhaps is to start a ministry.
 Maybe it's to start a business or a family.
 Maybe it means going to the mission field.
 Maybe it means serving here.
 Maybe it means staying faithful
 in your plan to serve.
 Maybe it means serving here.
 Maybe it means staying faithful where you're planted.
 Maybe it's confessing a sin.
 Maybe it's saying yes to your call.
 Whatever it is,
 he's inviting you today.
 But before we talk about that,
 I never want to preach
 without giving the opportunity to know Jesus.
 Maybe you're here today
 or joining us online.
 And you would say, John,
 I'm not a follower of Jesus.
 Maybe you got invited by a friend.
 But you've never made the decision
 to accept Christ into your life.
 The Bible says that Jesus came
 at just the right time.
 At the culmination of the ages
 when time was in,
 He stepped into human history
 and lived a perfect life.
 Died on the cross.
 And He paid the price for your sins and mine.
 Your past and mine.
 And the Bible says He lives and intercedes on our behalf.
 He fights for you.
 He fights for me.
 And today maybe you say, John,
 I've never accepted Christ.
 But I want that forgiveness of sin.
 Of the past.
 I want that hope.
 It does not mean you have all the answers.
 I know you have more questions than answers.
 But what it means today
 is that you're going to take that first step
 and then beyond that
 you have friends here that want to walk with you
 and help with the questions that will come.
 But if that's you, I want to pray with you right now.
 Or maybe today
 you say, John, I could really use a fresh start.
 A second chance.
 A do-over.
 A new beginning.
 Maybe some people still think you live like you should.
 But if you're honest today
 it's been a long time since you actually live for Christ.
 And maybe today
 you would say
 I could really use a fresh start.
 If that's you, I have really good news.
 Jesus is here.
 His arms open wide.
 To welcome you home.
 To welcome you back to the family.
 Here's what I want you to do.
 Every head bowed, every eye closed.
 A private moment with you, me and Jesus.
 If that's you.
 And you say, John, I want to ask Christ into my life.
 For the first time.
 Or John, I need a fresh start today.
 Right where you are.
 I just want you to raise your hand and wave at me.
 I need a fresh start.
 I need a new beginning.
 Christ in my life.
 Yeah, I see you.
 Who else? I need a fresh start, John.
 I see you, my friend.
 Christ in my life, yes, I see you.
 Who else? Yes, I see you too.
 I need that fresh start.
 I want that new beginning.
 Anybody else want to pray?
 Yeah, I see you too.
 Anyone else? I want a fresh start.
 Alright.
 Here's what we're going to do.
 We're going to pray this prayer of faith.
 Because you're not alone.
 You've got a family.
 I'm going to pray in English.
 He's going to pray in Swedish.
 Repeat it with us now.
 This is the prayer and the desire of your heart.
 Lord Jesus, I need you.
 Come into my life.
 I accept you.
 As the son of God.
 Give me a fresh start.
 Give me hope.
 And a bright future.
 Life.
 Here and eternal.
 My friends, the Bible says if you ask Christ to come in.
 That he does.
 The old is gone.
 The new is come.
 You're a new creation in Christ Jesus.
 So if you meant that and prayed it with all your heart.
 Congratulations.
 Welcome home.
 You're going to get a fresh start today.
 I want to encourage you.
 In just a moment.
 Find one of the pastors.
 Because they want to help and walk with you for the journey ahead.
 You are not alone.
 Welcome home.
 Now I want everyone to stand your feet.
 And I want to make an invitation to come and pray.
 So I want the prayer team to come and get ready.
 But as we begin this day.
 With the invitation let's go.
 With the invitation let's go.
 I know there are several people in this room.
 Joining online.
 Maybe you're here today.
 And you would say you've been in the wrong place.
 Or had the wrong posture.
 Today there's an invitation.
 To move from comfort, from sleep.
 And to step into the place God is calling you.
 And to step into the place God is calling you.
 Maybe you've been with the wrong people.
 There's an invitation today.
 To trust him where he's leading you with the right people.
 And most of us today.
 There's an invitation.
 Let's go.
 To step out in faith.
 Into the perhaps.
 And holding his hand.
 And being led by the Spirit of God.
 Trust in faith.
 Where he's leading us.
 If there's a dream. If there's a hope.
 If there's a future. If there's a season.
 Where he's inviting you into the perhaps.
 Or would you take a step of faith.
 Come right now.
 That step of faith.
 Into the perhaps.
 And have someone believe with you right now.
 So Lord right now.
 We thank you for your invitation.
 We thank you for your calling.
 We come to you today.
 With open hands and an open heart.
 We thank you that you still call the Jonathans.
 You still awaken the restless.
 You put fire inside of us.
 Right now we say yes.
 We say yes to your will.
 We say yes to your direction.
 We say yes to the perhaps.
 Meet us in this moment.
 And as we take a step towards you.
 Take a step towards us.
 And in faith.
 So we will see you in the perhaps.
 And do what you have in heart to do.
 We take this step saying we trust you.
 Perhaps. Meet us here now.
 In Jesus name. Amen.
 If God's giving you perhaps.
 Take a step of faith.
 And we're going to sing this song of worship and surrender.
 Amen.
 I have decided.
 To follow Jesus.
 No turning back.
 No turning back.
 And the orchestra.
 I have decided.
 To follow Jesus.
 No turning back.
 I have decided.
 To follow Jesus.
 No turning back.
 No turning back.
 I have decided.
 We're back in the studio after a challenging message.
 But also very encouraging.
 We've listened to John Carano from Barcelona.
 I think you've been touched.
 I think you've been touched by this message.
 I just want to encourage you.
 Give a response.
 It's easy when you're sitting in the sofa.
 Or in front of the screen.
 You think this was good.
 But when you respond to what you've heard.
 That's when God will work.
 Now we have the great joy and have with us.
 I have a friend in the studio.
 And I think she also touched our hearts.
 She has been six times in Sweden.
 I will try to translate.
 She has been six times in Sweden.
 She is half Swedish.
 You can translate.
 We are so blessed that you have come to Sweden.
 We are so blessed that you have come to Sweden.
 This year as well.
 Can you tell us a little bit about what you and your husband John
 are doing in Barcelona?
 What church are you pastoring?
 The question to Brandy is...
 First of all we are signalling you to come here.
 Tell us a little bit about the work in Barcelona.
 My husband and I are pastors
 in the International Church of Barcelona.
 We've been there now for 15 years.
 At the church for 11 years.
 We went from a small group of English speaking people
 to a much larger group of 95 plus people
 to a much larger group of 95 plus nationalities.
 Much larger group, but over 95 different nationalities.
 And we are so grateful for what God is doing in our midst.
 And we are so grateful for what God is doing in our midst.
 We are actually shocked by what God is doing in our midst.
 He is pouring out His Spirit on all flesh.
 And we get to be a very small part of what He is doing
 in this beautiful Europe.
 And we get to be a small part of what God is doing in Europe.
 Yesterday in the meeting you shared about
 how you have groups all over Barcelona
 with different languages.
 Can you just tell me what kind of project
 or what is that...what is it?
 Yesterday you told us about all the groups
 that are out there all over Barcelona.
 Can you just elaborate a little bit about that?
 Yes, so what we are realising...
 People are all over Catalunya.
 They need to be known.
 Someone needs to know when they are not at church.
 I want to know everyone.
 I cannot know everyone.
 So what we have encouraged is a front line of pastoral care.
 So what we have encouraged is a front line of pastoral care.
 A front line of community.
 A front line of community.
 And these groups are literally spreading
 all throughout Catalunya right now.
 If they make it to Sunday, wonderful.
 If they make it to Sunday, wonderful.
 But we really believe that the work is done
 of discipleship Monday through Saturday.
 And then our Sunday is the celebration of that.
 And then our Sunday is the celebration of that.
 That's where we worship Jesus together.
 So right now we have 14 languages.
 We need many more languages.
 And we are seeing an explosion of discipleship and growth.
 And we are seeing an explosion of discipleship and growth.
 People are getting saved in coffee shops.
 People are getting saved in the park.
 In the random office building.
 In the living room.
 We are seeing an explosion of discipleship.
 We are seeing an explosion of discipleship.
 We are so grateful for it.
 You mentioned yesterday that when you came to Europe
 for 15 years ago, you felt like a dark person.
 Do you feel that something has happened
 in these 15 years? How would you describe an change?
 Absolutely.
 The people that told us not to get our hopes up.
 The people that told us not to have too high hopes.
 The people that told us not to have too high hopes.
 They were not trying to discourage us.
 They were trying to encourage us.
 But they were saying it's hard.
 It's dark.
 Don't have high expectations that won't be met.
 Just keep doing what you can do.
 And of course we took that differently.
 It's a new day.
 Those same people that told me those words 15 years ago
 reached out to me last week.
 And they said we cannot believe
 what is happening in Europe.
 They were speaking off of their experience.
 And that experience is changing.
 Because God is sovereignly moving.
 What he said was true.
 It is no longer true.
 We are in a new season.
 Isaiah 43.19.
 I'm doing a new thing.
 Even now it's springing up.
 He's making a way in the desert and a stream in the wasteland.
 And we're not the only ones seeing it.
 Our friends all over Europe are telling us similar stories.
 Which makes me so excited.
 It's nothing we're doing.
 The pressure's off.
 God is doing something sovereign
 and we're a part of it in these last days.
 God is doing something sovereign and we're a part of it.
 Amen.
 Can you just explain a little bit if there are some viewers
 that didn't watch it yet?
 Just give a little taste.
 The theme for the conference is
 Activate Your Purpose.
 You describe the difference between
 having potential and actually
 leading to a purpose.
 Can you just go through it a little bit?
 There is a purpose for each one of his children.
 But if we don't move past potential
 we will not accomplish that purpose.
 Our good intentions are not sufficient.
 Our good intentions are not sufficient.
 It's walking the path of faith that makes a difference.
 I don't want to dream.
 I want to be transformed.
 And there are steps we have to take.
 So I shared three obstacles that I have to continue to overcome.
 And I shared three obstacles that I have to continue to overcome.
 You all have them.
 For me they are doubt
 and they are distractions and I mentioned discouragement.
 There are doubts, distractions and there is murder.
 But there are so many more.
 And as we overcome those
 we move towards our God-given purpose.
 But we have to actively resist those obstacles.
 But we have to actively resist those obstacles.
 Or we will shrink back and not move forward.
 Otherwise we will go back and not get where we were.
 Amen.
 You also said that
 we should not believe the lie that
 the best is in the past.
 A lot of our viewers
 are in the older age category.
 are in the older age category.
 There are some people who look back
 and say that God could use them back in the day.
 and say that God could use them back in the day.
 But what now?
 Do you have anything encouraging to say to these viewers
 that they are grandmothers, grandfathers
 retired?
 They have a calling for their lives right now.
 Yesterday you mentioned that the best is always ahead.
 Many of our viewers are in the older age category
 and can feel that they have done their best
 and their time has been.
 Do you have anything encouraging to say to those
 who might experience it that way?
 Absolutely.
 I think that every season in life is different.
 There are seasons that are more physically active.
 There is strength in our bodies that may not be there later.
 Which is why you have to know the season you are in.
 This is our season to push.
 We have the God given strength to push.
 But even at this age
 I am looking behind me.
 Who is walking with us?
 Who are we raising up?
 To anyone who is listening right now.
 Particularly our older listeners.
 We need you.
 We need you more than ever.
 We need your wisdom.
 We need your experience.
 We need your prayer.
 Spiritual parenting is more necessary now I believe than ever.
 So maybe your best days
 or more visible days might be behind you.
 I believe these can be your most effective days.
 I believe these can be your most effective days.
 And the legacy that you are leading
 is something that each of us needs.
 So don't shrink back.
 No matter what season you are in
 until you see Jesus face to face
 there is good work to be done.
 That's a great word.
 It's the truth.
 Thank you so much for taking your time here
 and you are going to have a seminar for the women.
 So people can still come if it's 1 PM.
 Exactly.
 Brandy is going straight ahead
 and has a seminar for women.
 If you are nearby,
 you should come here.
 We are grateful for this little chat
 with Brandy.
 Before time runs out
 we want to mention that we are back from the studio
 for tonight's meeting.
 Tonight it's a treat.
 I don't know if you've heard Ankit Sajwan.
 I've seen him on social media before the conference
 and I thought wow!
 And then I see that he is coming here.
 We want to encourage you to do everything you can
 to come here.
 It's going to happen before the evening meeting
 with different seminars.
 Otherwise you are very welcome back to the studio.
 We start the meeting at 7 PM
 and Carl Gustav Severin will be with us
 for tonight's meeting.
 It's worth watching.
 Before we end I want to remind you
 that it's very nice if you want to hear from us.
 You may have a response
 or questions from where you are.
 You may have needs and want to be encouraged.
 You are very welcome to hear from us.
 You can contact us on the channels
 or on the live stream.
 You are very welcome to respond.
 Especially if you have a request
 there is an email address
 that I want to raise in every broadcast.
 bon.
 At www.livetsord.se
 With this we thank you, Emilie.
 And I hope to see you again tonight.
 Have a nice afternoon.
