[Transcription: Whsiper Medium - English]

 Good evening and welcome back to the Europe Conference 2025.
 It's a fantastic atmosphere behind us and we can feel it, right Elin?
 Absolutely. If you just walk around the venue you can see how people meet each other.
 It's not just a conference, it would be fantastic.
 Just the meetings, but there is so much more.
 There are people who come together, who meet each other.
 Now at lunch I meet new people I haven't met before.
 I got to hear their stories and how they are involved in different jobs.
 There is so much more.
 I think it's a bit of an exclamation with the conference.
 The meetings are why we are here.
 We are here to meet God, we are here to hear from heaven.
 And you get so much bonus.
 It's our purpose to sit here before and after the services.
 We want to give you a chance to be here.
 You get a bit of everything from us.
 Because we believe that God is a extra cloud over you.
 You might complain, and you can do it in a way that you can't be here.
 But you should know that God is with you.
 God wants to meet you.
 Words that are being uttered and the prayers that are being prayed.
 You are included in that.
 We hope that you can feel that you are here and that you are at home.
 You are very welcome.
 Another person who is welcome is the man on the right side of the fire.
 Carl Gustav Severin.
 Thank you so much.
 What a pleasure to have you here in the studio.
 Thank you for having me.
 You are the lead critic here.
 Yes, first on Tuesday evening.
 I liked your message.
 I usually like it, so I have no problem with what you are saying.
 But it was easy to remember.
 And these short prayers, that we don't always have to be
 so many words and so nice words.
 But a call to the Lord in all simplicity.
 It gives results.
 And when you use these simple things like a glove,
 it puts a picture in people's minds, so they remember this.
 It works for me.
 I often get these pictures, pictures of this glove.
 You can almost see the slide out.
 You come to a conference, you feel completely out of service.
 And then his hand comes into the glove.
 And then something happens to this glove.
 His hand is in us.
 It was wonderful to see everyone who came for healing.
 I've heard today that you have been healed.
 Yes, it is so.
 It was very nice.
 Then I have to say to you who are here too.
 I would very much like to hear if you have a witness brother.
 God has spoken to you, God has met you.
 You may have received healing, medicine.
 Can't you hear of you?
 It would be so nice for us to work here and get some feedback,
 get some response.
 So you can hear of you.
 There are many channels to do it now.
 Look down on channel 10 or you look at TLA,
 but you can look at the words of life.
 Stream, but never neglected.
 So you will find a way to contact us there.
 Write a parade and let us know what God does in your life.
 Carl Gustav, this is not the first conference for you.
 No, actually I have been here in antiquity soon.
 I have been here in all conferences since the beginning.
 This is up in the sports hall.
 I have heard a pedicant who has been here for a thousand years.
 But really so many years.
 Then it is not really.
 But this is the highlight for us in life.
 To come to the summer conference, or as it is now called the European conference.
 It started with a few people in Sweden,
 but now when we have gone out in the world and enriched,
 people have become older, and then Chamois has started.
 And now they also come here and unite with us.
 And that is why it is here, as you said,
 it is not just a meeting, but a family party.
 To come home and for me it is,
 this week will not be anything else for me than to be here.
 And now I see my children here, and grandchildren here,
 and help to work.
 We are happy as a family to be here.
 Yes, it is something beautiful with that.
 There are also a lot of things happening for all ages here.
 You who are with us online, you will get tomorrow and evening.
 But if you have the opportunity to come here,
 we would like to encourage you to do so,
 because a lot is happening during the day too.
 It happened for children and for young people.
 Today, for example, Brandy Carano had a meeting for all women.
 And yes, it is best to be here.
 But if you do not have the opportunity,
 you have chosen the next best.
 Exactly.
 Carl Gustav, you mentioned here that you have the work
 out in Europe and in the world, and that they come here.
 Can you just mention something, the word of life,
 everyone knows the principle of what the word of life is,
 but you may not know how big it is,
 but how much mission work you actually have.
 It is a great work, if you look at it like that.
 It started when we went into Russia,
 then Ukraine, the old Soviet Union, Eastern Europe.
 PO was also with us, has been with us all the way.
 And then India opened.
 Tonight we will have an Indian speaker.
 And for us it is fantastic to hear an Indian speaker who comes here,
 who God has raised up, who was a message to all of India today.
 The speaker on TV to all the people of India.
 I was just in Vietnam and celebrated the 20th anniversary
 when we got there, which was fantastic.
 It started with us being in Russia,
 and then there are 100 Vietnamese sitting there.
 I wonder what you are doing here.
 We are elite students who are here, we are going to be communists,
 and then we will get an education at the university,
 which is the strongest that exists.
 And they become the oldest, and go home to Vietnam
 and start gatherings.
 And today we are 260 people in the gathering.
 For me, the mission is not to bear fruit,
 but to plant trees that bear fruit.
 It is not us who are the fruit, but we are the fruit.
 And then it is the leaders who start up their work.
 It has been great for us.
 I am a bit curious to ask Brandy a question.
 She saw a change in the tension from the fact that they started the work there
 and moved there 15 years ago until today.
 You have traveled for many years in Europe and the world.
 But if we focus on Europe, have you seen any change in the public opinion?
 Is there something that is happening in Europe from the time you started traveling?
 It might have been in the waves.
 Yes, absolutely.
 If we go back to Europe, there is a big difference today.
 There is a big openness.
 P.O. and I were in Bulgaria last year and got to experience the openness that happened there.
 It is a change.
 When the entire communist bloc fell, the Berlin Wall fell,
 it was unthinkable.
 Someone said that the Berlin Wall would fall in five years and was accused of being a false prophet.
 But it fell and I was there myself.
 I have a part of the Berlin Wall at home.
 It was unthinkable.
 That Russia would fall, Lenin's statue would fall, we would enter with the Gospel.
 Today we have over 400 gatherings in Russia.
 In Moscow, over 70 people are born every weekend.
 Despite the war and everything that has happened,
 there is a wake up call in all countries.
 I would say that in Sweden as well.
 I don't think we should ask for more wake up calls.
 There is wake up call in our country as well.
 People become more and more loved.
 People meet God.
 I don't think it is good to always shoot up wake up calls.
 I have the feeling that you are talking about the last conference you did.
 Yes, that's right.
 That now is wake up call.
 We shouldn't just think that the four months of the sea time
 is now the sea is the wake up call.
 I feel that, even in Sweden.
 What we see in Sweden and also in these countries.
 For me, who has been in the army for over 70 years and I have received 500 awards in over 50 years,
 it has never been more fun, it has never been more exciting to be with you now.
 I am a pensioner, but I have gone down all the time, so I try to work further.
 I am like an old hunting dog, I can't hunt every day, but we want to be there to hunt.
 And we think it is good to see all the young people who are coming up now.
 The young generation who take responsibility is happy with this.
 Totally.
 We are incredibly grateful that you want to keep going Carl Gustav.
 God has given you as a gift to Christ in body worldwide.
 But that we get to be part of this, that we get to be part of it,
 that is a great gift.
 I think about what we are talking about, you have probably heard about it,
 and maybe you who are with me have also heard about the million month
 that has recently been ended, where many Christians all over Europe have focused on
 evangelization, man to man, primarily in larger cities across Europe.
 And where you have reached quite a few, tens of thousands of people with the Gospel.
 I think it is between 7 and 8 thousand who have said their yes to Jesus.
 That is about 10% of those who have spoken with him.
 Just randomly out on the street, they have said after hearing the Gospel,
 yes, I want that.
 And I think that is an incredibly clear sign that God is a father on our continent.
 It is really exciting.
 Yes, really. It is very fun to hear that.
 When I was young, when I came to my first field, as we said at that time, 1973,
 I was 20 years old, I thought that everyone would be a field in this city.
 I was so expectant, I knew it would be a thorn, but it did not happen.
 When we came to the next one, it did not happen.
 I have been doing this for many years now.
 But now I have come to the conclusion that I cannot be part of changing the whole world,
 but I can change the whole world for one person.
 Can I give the Gospel to one person who needs Jesus?
 If all of us did that, we would say that we had a great awakening.
 There are many today who I do not think are at all negative to the Gospel,
 but on the contrary, very, very positive.
 So it is a time of joy.
 If we continue on the mission track, what do you think,
 we have a survey here, we work in India, there are many Vietnamese you mentioned,
 but do you see any new fields that have been sown on the way in?
 In Asia, India is a giant country.
 We have China, which is a little tougher now, but I have a lot of faith in China.
 We have Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, many new doors that we are starting to get now in Asia.
 We have one of our missionaries who will move out to Vietnam now.
 Therefore, we are putting the next summit in Thailand.
 That is where most people live today.
 Exactly.
 If I were God, I would put my hand on that area.
 But at the same time, we did something very special.
 We took our first collect here yesterday to Kosovo.
 I have never been to Kosovo before. It is a country that almost everyone has forgotten.
 There are only 24 collections in the whole country.
 These are the places I feel like we want to go to.
 We want to go to those un-Nordic people.
 And there have been great terrorists born in that country.
 In the ISIS wars, they have been born there.
 Let us believe that new godsmen and goddesses will be born in little Kosovo.
 Sometimes I think it is too small, it was a big project.
 But everything we have seen here in this collection has always started small.
 And that is how it is in the Kingdom of God. It is a mustard seed that counts.
 We heard earlier about the BTC, the Bible Training Course.
 Which you want to start with now in North Macedonia.
 And it has often been the way that the Word of Life has started.
 You have started with Bible teaching, you have come in in some way.
 And from there it has grown.
 When we were in Moscow, we were 17 people in an apartment.
 And we thought, this big city, how will it go?
 And then we opened the Bible and it says, I have a lot of people in this city.
 And I thought it was such a wonderful word that God gave.
 And today there are thousands of people who are relatives.
 And in Kiev, Ukraine and other places.
 I was in Armenia two weeks ago.
 A collection that started with the earth's creed.
 We were in the same studio once.
 People died, 100,000 people died.
 And we got to go there and pray the Gospel for the people.
 Today the collection has 10,000 members.
 And they live in other countries.
 We have Georgia here today, and Azerbaijan.
 Countries that have been in war with each other.
 But in the middle of the war, the Gospel comes forward.
 I don't think we should be afraid of the public when it's war and darkness.
 On the contrary, it should inspire our mission interest.
 Now we should raise our eyes, now we should look up and see the lake.
 And dare to enter these dark places.
 Amen.
 That's what we associate the Word of Life with a lot.
 When others come back, the Word of Life comes forward.
 It's wonderful to hear that this thought is still the bearing thought.
 We can think of the Word of Life four times a year.
 What can it be? 42 years?
 With the years you can be a little comfortable, you can be a little careful.
 You can think that we have done enough.
 But as a collection, or as a group, of course.
 As long as we live on this earth, God has something for us.
 He wants us to move forward strongly.
 It's encouraging to hear about this.
 We want to continue and we want to unite with other Christians.
 I think there will be a corporate anointing over Christianity in Sweden.
 Together, we will be happy and we will work together.
 Thank you very much for taking the time to watch this.
 Thank you. It's nice to be here.
 We will continue. This is like a real evening of mission.
 We will now hear about Hankit Seywan.
 After that, we will meet two employees from the Word of Life who work with missions.
 There is a lot of Indians.
 Yes, it will be an Indian theme tonight.
 Someone who has been in India and has shared the Bible center.
 We will have Tia Hamri who has lived in India and has helped with the work there.
 We will have Redjett Manahed who works with Indian Children.
 It will be exciting here after the meeting.
 Now we will go into the meeting and listen to what God will give us through Hankit Seywan.
 God bless you.
 King Jesus, King is King and Lord is Lord. Thank you Lord.
 Let us sing Wandering into the Night.
 I'm slowly drifting above that wall
 And just when I run on the road
 And just when I ran on the road
 I met a man I didn't know
 And he told me that I was not alone
 I need you to go. He picked me up
 He picked me up, He turned me around
 He placed my feet on solid ground
 I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
 He puts me healed by heart
 He changed my day
 Forever free I'm not the same
 I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
 I thank God
 Come here.
 I cannot deny
 I cannot deny what I see
 Got no choice but to believe my clouds are burning
 My gosh yes
 My gosh yes they win
 So so long to my
 So so long to my old friends
 Burden and bitterness
 You can just keep it moving
 You will be well by me
 From now till I walk the streets of gold
 I sing of how you saved my soul
 The wayward son has found his way back home
 He picked me up, He turned me around
 He placed my feet on solid ground
 I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
 He puts me healed by heart
 He changed my day
 Forever free I'm not the same
 I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
 I thank God
 Hey hey
 I thank the Jesus
 For with this He's born
 Okay I need the other two now.

 Att utbilda Guds m√§nniskor
 Med sitt ord av faith
 Och att √•terf√§lla dem till v√§rlden
 F√∂r att pr√§glera Gospels
 V√•r mandat √§r att bygga en epistolisk kyrka
 Movement som kan n√• utg√•ende
 Fram v√•ra n√§rm√§n
 Till de enda av v√§rlden
 Nu kallar vi p√• att fokusera p√• tv√•
 M√•nga omr√•den
 Europa
 Och Asien
 Detta √§r platsen d√§r Guds vill att vi invester
 Bygga
 S√§nda m√§nniskor
 Och se att hans kringdom √∂ppnas
 H√§r i Europa idag ser vi hur Guds
 Uppfattar en ny generation av misioner
 Vi tror p√• nya kyrkor
 I Portugal, i Spanien, i Rumania och i Balkans
 M√•nga misioner, kyrkor och bibliska skolor
 Och kyrkor och planer
 Detta √§r riktigt v√•rt h√•rdbete
 I Europa idag
 H√§r i Asien
 Vi √§r i en ny s√§song av jobbet
 Vi har en stark presens i Vietnam och Indien
 Men nu leder Guds oss att fokusera p√•
 Alla mellan
 Land som Myanmar, Thailand, Laos och Cambodia
 Are places where we want to see revival
 Where missionaries, Bible schools
 And new church plants can grow
 When you become a monthly giver for missions
 You are part of building the next generation of missions
 We believe thousands of lives will be transformed
 By our work in the coming years
 But we need you
 We are called to pray, to give and go together
 I'm a Christian

 Om jag minns r√§tt, det var ungef√§r den tiden
 Och jag b√∂rjade inte med en stor summa
 Utan det var starka, h√§rliga, fantastiska 20 kronor i m√•naden
 20 kronor i m√•naden
 Och om det bara hade varit jag som hade gett de 20 kronorna
 D√• hade inte vi kommit s√• j√§ttel√•ngt
 Men lyckligtvis s√• √§r det m√•nga som kan vara med och bidra tillsammans

 Ge till att m√§nniskor tr√•dde runtomkring i Europa och Asien
 F√• utrusta s√• att de √§r redo att vara ljus i den m√∂rka v√§rlden de lever i
 Bidra till att vi f√•r g√• ut med evangelet
 S√• att m√§nniskor som lever i det m√∂rkret f√•r uppt√§cka vem Jesus Christus √§r
 √Ñr du glad att du k√§nner Jesus Christus?
 √Ñr du glad att du √§r fr√§ls?
 Vill du att andra m√§nniskor ska f√• uppleva det m√∂tet med Christus?
 Ja!
 Vad? D√• √§r det inga problem va?
 Eller? Visst vill du be om att bidra till det h√§r?

 Awesome, let's give a hand for T√©a, come on
 Hallelujah
 Now if you want to hear more about being a missionspartner
 We have our stand just outside here
 If you go out from the main door on the left side you can find more information
 My name is Willem M√§nnister
 And I work here as a missionscoordinator
 And we also have an opportunity now to give for missions
 I just want to ask
 Have you ever heard about the missions concept called 1040 window?
 It's an old concept from the 90's, 1040 window
 That wants to emphasize the area in the world that needs the gospel the most
 Where the most un-rich people groups are
 I actually have it as a picture here
 So here we have
 Yes, 10...
 Come on, 1040 window here
 So if you want to do pioneering missions
 This is the area
 But now in the recent years
 There is a new missions concept called the circle of significance
 That wants to emphasize the main area within the 1040 window
 Here we have the circle of significance
 You can zoom it in
 Now this is not a very big area geographically
 It's only about 15% of the world
 But my dear friend, listen to this
 50% of the world population lives inside this circle
 Every second person on this earth lives inside this circle
 I want to give you some numbers, is it okay?
 I want to give you some numbers, is it okay?
 99% of all Hindus and 98% of all Buddhists live here
 50% of all Muslims in the world live in this circle
 Actually there are more Muslims inside this circle than the Middle East and the Gulf countries combined
 There are actually double more Muslims inside than in the Middle East
 70% of all the un-rich people groups are inside this circle
 But only we have 4.2% Christians in this circle
 So this is not rocket science
 If we ask the question where should we focus with missions?
 If we want to do pioneering missions?
 Where should we go?
 This is something that we have felt in our missions leadership
 This is the direction we want to go
 How God is leading us towards this direction
 And we want to invest in this region
 We want to coordinate the work
 We want to send people
 And as we have been praying, who we should send to coordinate this work?
 Now I try to be very Scandinavian humble here
 When we have been praying who we should send
 We have decided to send me
 So now me and my wife
 We have been living in Afghanistan and in India for many years
 But now we as a family we are moving
 And I actually have my family here, can you stand up please?
 So here is my beautiful wife Johanna
 We have been married 20 years
 So here is my beautiful wife Johanna
 We have been married 26 years
 And here is Noah and Emmie
 And we as a family we are now moving in two weeks
 To Hanoi Vietnam
 Amen
 Can you put the Hanoi into the map?
 Look at this map
 Hanoi geographically is back in the middle of this circle
 So if you want to do missions that is a very good place to start
 And what we want to do
 Is really to raise up a new generation of Asian missionaries
 Get an Asian missions movement going
 Because it might be difficult for us to send 100 missionaries from here to Asia
 But we can raise up 1000 Asian missionaries for Asia
 We need to just get going Hallelujah
 Now we have a strong work in India
 We are going to have mission schools in India this year
 We are going to have mission schools in India this year
 We have strong work in Vietnam
 We are going to do mission schools over there
 We want to do mission schools in Myanmar
 In Laos
 We have leader training in Thailand and Cambodia
 Philippines is opening up
 I know it's a lot of countries now but in October
 I will go for the first time to Japan
 Can you say Japan?
 There is a church movement of 110 churches
 And they want to connect with us and with our missions work
 I will go and meet with the leaders and have conference and preachings
 My point saying is my dear friends
 Asia is opening up for us
 Is that Asia is opening up for us
 Hallelujah and I just want to proclaim it
 We have about 350 plus churches in Asia today
 I believe that we will see 1000 churches in Asia
 Not because we like the number
 But because I believe
 That God wants to get tens of thousands of people saved
 That God wants to get tens of thousands of people saved
 And he is doing that through his church
 So we need to start the churches
 Hallelujah
 Come again in the meeting, hallelujah
 Now we need two things
 Actually we need 2000 things
 Two important things
 First of all wisdom
 Wisdom
 I believe that the Word of Life has an apostolic mission calling
 We need that apostolic anointing to flow
 So that we go through the right doors
 Right people, right contacts, right countries
 Please pray for Word of Life missions
 Pray for us Amen
 Secondly
 We need finances
 What I was just explaining here
 It costs about 700,000 for us
 But now if we are about 3000 people here
 It's approximately 250 crowns per person
 250 it's not that bad
 Amen
 Say to your wife, yes she is talking to you
 Say to your wife, yes she is talking to you
 And I just want to invite you
 To be a part of what God is doing in Asia right now
 Can we take up an offering tonight
 A pioneering, visionary, first steps offering
 For our work in Asia
 Amen
 Let's pray
 Heavenly Father
 We thank you that Asia is opening up for us
 But Lord we don't want to miss your heart beat for Asia
 Help us to hear
 Help us to see
 Where your heart beat is
 So that we can do what you want us to do in the name of Jesus
 Amen
 Amen
 You can give in many different ways
 You can give in many different ways
 You can give in many different ways
 You can give in many different ways
 There is of course swish and vips
 And it will appear on the screens
 Instructions on how you give in those ways
 You can give a balloon
 And if you lift up your hand
 The missionaries will come
 The meeting world will come
 With the leaves
 On these leaves you can give in
 Like Thea talked about
 I want to give monthly
 For the long-term
 You can also give in on these leaves
 Or at our home in Monten when ever
 And of course if you are with us online
 You are very welcome to be part of this as well
 As God does
 Just go to our website and give a gift
 Then you can be part of it
 Thank you for your gift
 Thank you
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen
 The sun was darkened in the heaven's thunder
 And for a moment death had thought it conquered
 But it wasn't over till you said it's over
 Your word is greater still
 The perfect sacrifice your body broken
 As you restored to us what sin has stolen
 Once and for all you tore the veil wide open
 Your power is strongest still
 Oh praise, oh praise
 To the name above all names
 Jesus, you reign
 You're the name above all names
 Yes you are
 You turned the grave into a new beginning
 Our God has risen, you're alive and breathing
 There's nothing that could stand against your victory
 Your name is higher still
 Oh praise, oh praise
 To the name above all names
 Jesus, you reign
 You're the name above all names
 Yes you are
 Your name is higher
 Your name is higher
 Across still the steps
 The blood still flows
 The work is finished
 And hell still knows
 That the grave is still empty
 The stone is still rolled
 And you're still high and lifted up
 You're still seated on the throne
 Across still the steps
 The blood still flows
 The blood still flows
 And hell still knows
 That the grave is still empty
 The stone is still rolled
 And you're still high and lifted up
 You're still seated on the throne
 Oh praise, oh praise
 To the name above all names
 Jesus, you reign
 You're the name above all names
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 Every voice will proclaim
 There is no hiding
 Hallelujah
 H-U-H-U-H
 H-U-H-E-W-A-S-I-C
 There is no hiding
 Hallelujah
 Every voice will proclaim
 There is no hiding
 Hallelujah
 H-U-H-E-W-A-S-I-C
 Oh praise, oh praise
 To the name above all names
 Jesus, you reign
 You're the name above all names
 The name above all names
 The name above all names
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 Wonderful
 It's as good as we turn around a little bit in the sky, it will be very high I can tell you
 Wonderful, you can sit down, I have the great joy to present tonight's speaker
 Who flew in from the world's largest country, who is actually inside this circus that William Henningstut talks about here
 And that is no new acquaintance, but a good friend to the meeting, a good friend to us who has been here at the conference before, and that is Pastor Ankit Saiwan
 From Family of the Lord Jesus Church in Delhi
 And with him is also a good friend of ours, Nehemia Abraham, who is also a pastor
 And it's so wonderful that they can come here and talk a little with Pastor Ankit before the meeting, he tells us about what enormous breakthroughs they can see in India right now
 Now we are not in India, but we believe in breakthroughs here too, right?
 Amen, but I think it will be very, very high-spirited tonight
 And I think Jesus will move among many, many people tonight
 So let us just open our hearts, let us set our expectations on Jesus, he loves us, he will do wonderful things tonight
 But before we let Pastor Ankit go on stage, we will also take a look, or take a little glimpse from India, so we will understand a little more, I think
 Then we will see on the screens
 And Christians are persecuted for their faith
 We are witnessing the greatest outpouring of the Holy Spirit in this nation
 This is not the time to shrink back, it is time to move forward
 This is the time for revival, from the north to the south, from the east to the west
 Multitudes, as far as the eyes can see, are gathering to worship the name of Jesus
 In villages and cities, in homes and highways, something is happening
 Jesus is appearing to Muslims, to Hindus, to Sikhs, telling them that he is the God of all flesh
 Flesh
 Medically verified miracles are becoming headlines

 Before we go into the word of God, could you stand for a moment
 Amen
 before we go into God's word here.
 Amen. Before we go into the word, let's just praise the Lord for some time.
 Let's just praise the Lord right now.
 Without instruments.
 Without singing a song.
 You are the instrument of worship.
 Can we lift up our hands?
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 We praise you Lord Jesus.
 We glorify you Lord Jesus.
 We magnify you Lord Jesus.
 We honor you Lord Jesus.
 Thank God for victory.
 Thank God for victory.
 Come on give him some praise.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you Lord for open heaven.
 Thank you Lord for victory.
 Thank you Father for everything that you are about to do in this place.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 So many people's lives will be set on fire.
 So many people's lives will be set on fire.
 We give you praise.
 We give you glory.
 We give you honor Jesus.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Hallelujah.
 Oh there is tremendous anointing in this place.
 There is such a smudging on this place.
 Amen.
 And I want you to sit with expectation.
 I want you to have high expectations tonight.
 Amen.
 Not just expect a nice sermon.
 Not just expect a good service.
 I have not come here to give you a nice sermon.
 I have not come here to preach something good.
 So you should go home.
 In the kingdom when a church gets a breakthrough.
 In the kingdom of God when a assembly gets a breakthrough.
 One time the Lord told me we can share our victories.
 One time the Lord told me we can share our victories.
 The Lord told me that sometimes we can share our victories.
 We can impart the grace that is working.
 We can impart the grace that is working.
 I want to receive the grace that is in this place.
 And to impart the grace that is happening in India.
 We can share each other.
 I can give what I have received.
 And I can get what you have.
 Amen.
 I believe God is bringing us back to the gospel.
 I believe the Lord is bringing us back to the gospel.
 Of power.
 The power of the gospel.
 Amen.
 For the kingdom of God is not just talking.
 For the kingdom of God is not just talking.
 It is the power of God.
 The power of God.
 The kingdom of God is not just talking.
 It is the power of God.
 Amen.
 Hallelujah.
 You can be seated.
 Amen.
 Expectation is the breeding ground for manifestation.
 Expectation is where miracles grow.
 Expectation is where miracles grow.
 So I want you to expect today.
 I want you to expect today.
 Because the Spirit of the Lord is still speaking to the churches.
 Because the Spirit of the Lord is still speaking to the churches.
 This is why we have several meetings today.
 Amen.
 You know in Psalms 11.3 it says
 If the foundations be destroyed
 What can the righteous do?
 Devil is coming after the foundation
 Devil is coming after the foundation
 of the righteous.
 And God is calling us back to our foundations.
 And God is calling us back to our foundations.
 And God is calling us back to our foundations.
 It's simple Christianity
 This simple Christianity but powerful Christianity.
 I told you, I was born in a Hindu family.
 I remember that I had demons all my life.
 I have seen the darkness.
 Then I became a priest.
 Then I came to a church.
 And I met someone.
 And they said, what kind of congregation do you belong to?
 What does that mean?
 Are you a Baptist?
 Are you a Lutheran?
 Are you a Pentecostal?
 Are you Catholic?
 Are you a charismatic?
 Are you a Seventh-day Adventist?
 And I was so confused.
 Because I had no idea who I was.
 But you know what? In John 10.27 Jesus said, my sheep hears my voice.
 But in John 10.27 it says, my sheep hears my voice.
 So I went to my room and I asked the Lord.
 I said, Lord, what's my denomination?
 You tell me, am I a Pentecostal?
 Am I a charismatic?
 Am I a Baptist?
 And Jesus said, you are my son.
 That's your denomination.
 And I told him to tell you, we are sons and daughters of the most high God.
 And that is our denomination.
 And I said, Lord, what is Christianity?
 And I asked the Lord, what is Christianity?
 And this is what he told me.
 He said, the union of God and man is Christianity.
 He said, Christianity is the unity between man and God.
 It is when God descended in man and man ascended in God and a new creation was born.
 It is when God became man and man.
 It is when God became man and man came to God and we became a unity.
 And it is high time that the church knows who she is.
 And the meetings must begin to understand who they really are.
 Because if we don't know who we are, we can never live up to our full potential.
 So we can never live in accordance with our full potential.
 So as I was telling you, today I want to talk about coming back to our foundations.
 So today I am going to talk about coming to the foundation.
 And it is very simple.
 The message is simple.
 But it is the simple that carries the power.
 Paul tells the Corinthian church, I am afraid as Satan by his cunning craftiness,
 I am afraid that he might not take you away from the simplicity that is in Christ.
 He was afraid that the devil would take the Corinthians away from the simple Gospel.
 So the first foundation I want to talk about is coming back to the word of God.
 Coming back to the word of God.
 Mark 16.26, the disciples went everywhere preaching the word.
 In Mark 16.26, the disciples went everywhere preaching the word of God.
 And the Lord was there and confirmed it by making a sign in front of the people.
 If the Holy Spirit does not prove what we preach, we preach some other God, the Gospel.
 Can I speak the truth in this place?
 If you get offended, I leave the day after tomorrow.
 I have my wife who loves me, Jesus loves me and that is okay with me.
 Amen.
 Christianity is not about intellectual messages, it is the kingdom of power.
 Christianity is not only about intellectual messages, it is about God's power.
 Jesus did not come to show what he can do, but what we can do, what a human can do, through God.
 The one who believes in me should do greater deeds than these.
 It is our standard, Jesus is our mirror.
 We need to come back to this pure Gospel.
 The pure Gospel in our heart.
 If the foundations are destroyed.
 It is the same thing happening in India, we started seeing that so many young people were in the church, but they were growing up in a wordless Christianity.
 Because there is only one thing that Satan is afraid of.
 And that is the sword of the Spirit, that is the living word of God.
 Romans 1.17 says, for in the Gospel righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, for as it is written, just shall live by faith.
 Come on, can you turn to your neighbour and say, just shall live by faith?
 Just will not just go to a faith conference.
 I said just will not just go to a faith conference, just will live by faith.
 Just will dwell in faith.
 God is calling us back to become the people of faith.
 Hebrews 11.2 says, by faith elders obtain a good testimony.
 In the Hebrew letter it says that the elders received a testimony from the Lord.
 In the Hebrew letter it says that without faith it is impossible to please God.
 It does not say that it is difficult to please God.
 But how many people here want to please God?
 It does not happen without faith.
 And many try to please God by their fasts and their giving.
 But if you are fasting without faith, if you are praying without faith, if you are giving without faith, if you are opening the Bible without faith, if you go to church without faith, it is a dead religious tradition.
 And faith is not a magic formula, it is not mysterious.
 It is simple.
 You don't have to strive for faith.
 You don't have to earn faith.
 You receive faith.
 Romans 10.17 says, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.
 If you want to be a believer, you just need to hear the word of God.
 Because the faith that you live with is directly proportional to the word that is hidden in your heart.
 Because the faith that you live with is directly connected to the word of God that is in you.
 And in Hebrews 11 he talks about the heroes of faith.
 And it says, by faith, Abraham, by faith, Moses, and on and on and on.
 And for 20 times the Bible says by faith.
 If all the heroes, they did it by faith, guess how you will receive it.
 And it says, by faith, Abraham, by faith, Moses, and on and on and on.
 And for 20 times the Bible says by faith.
 If all the heroes, they did it by faith, guess how you and I will receive it.
 By faith it is not rocket science.
 Amen.
 You know, when I got saved, and I saw I was going to church,
 my heart broke because I saw the majority of Christians living in defeat.
 They were as depressed as people in the world.
 They were talking like people of the world.
 They were living like people of the world.
 Apart from Christianies, do you know what a Christianies is?
 People in China speak Chinese.
 People in Vietnam speak Vietnamese.
 People in the church speak Christianies.
 They speak Christianies.
 So when a person comes to the church, God is good.
 All the time.
 And all the time.
 God is good.
 Hallelujah.
 When I went to church first time, somebody said hallelujah.
 I said what, Luja?
 And the first time I was in the church, someone said hallelujah.
 So I turned to the person next to me, I said, what does it mean?
 So I turned to a person and said, what does it mean?
 And he said, I have no idea.
 Everybody says it.
 You also say it.
 The letter I got to know it means praise the Lord.
 But what I'm saying is, we will go and we will fit in the model of religious Christianity and not even know it.
 We are speaking Christianies.
 But we have satisfied ourselves.
 With religious things that have no power.
 With religious things that have no power.
 Paul says in the end days there will be people who have godliness without power and run away from such people.
 And Paul says that in the end there will be people who have evangelism without power and run away from such people.
 You know, in the bible.
 In God's word.
 In Mark 4, 11, Jesus is telling a parable.
 In Mark 4, 11, Jesus is telling a parable.
 And the disciples don't get it.
 So they come to Jesus.
 And Jesus says to you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven.
 To those who are outside, all these things come in the form of parables or stories.
 You will understand the secret of God's kingdom, but to what they are doing they will give you a parable.
 That means when you read the bible.
 That means when you read the bible.
 There are stories.
 And there are mysteries.
 Stories would inform you.
 Stories would inform you.
 But mysteries will transform you.
 Mysteries, they transform you.
 And we have so many Christians that are informed but not transformed.
 And we have so many Christians that are informed but not transformed.
 Because the only way you can know the mystery of the word of God is through the spirit of God.
 Because the only way you can understand God's mystery is through God's power.
 Because the bible says that the things of the spirit are foolishness to the natural man because they are spiritually deserved.
 Because it says that the word of God must be treated in a different way.
 Amen.
 So I asked the Lord, I said Lord I see so many people and there is no difference apart from they say praise the Lord and hallelujah.
 And I asked the Lord, there are so many people who just sing these songs and they say hallelujah and praise the Lord and so on.
 Why is it that we are not able to appropriate the victory that you have bought for every born again son and daughter?
 And he took me to Matthew, Mark 4.
 Can I speak the truth in this place?
 Are you sure?
 We will have inner healing session after preaching.
 You know there are so many people who have not understood that prayer is not a substitute to everything in the kingdom.
 What do I mean by that?
 There are so many people praying for a harvest when they have not sown a seed.
 So many people are praying for a harvest even though they have not sown a seed.
 Luke 8.11 says the word of God is the seed of God.
 In the beginning was the word with God and the word was God.
 And in him was life.
 In the word of God there is life.
 There are so many people who are trying to find God in a goose bump.
 There are so many people trying to find God in a feeling.
 God is not in a goose bump.
 You can feel goose bump.
 But it is your feeling that should follow your faith.
 Not your faith should follow your feeling.
 The Bible never says feel God, it says trust God.
 The word of God does not say feel God, it says trust God.
 You feel him or you don't feel him.
 But we are trying to feel God.
 But we are trying to feel God.
 I had seen the depth of darkness.
 I was mentally sick because of demons messed up my brain.
 And now when I got saved and I began to grow in the kingdom and Lord began to teach me.
 I saw how there are so many Christians they are missing the victorious life.
 Because they are always looking for the spectacular outside.
 But can I tell you, God is in his word.
 I said God is in his word.
 God is not in a feeling.
 God is not in what you feel.
 God is in his word.
 And the Lord began to teach me.
 The word is the seed.
 To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom.
 Jesus told Peter, I give you the keys.
 Matthew 7, 7 Jesus asked and you will receive knock and the door shall be opened.
 There is Matthew 7 that we shall ask and if we knock the door shall be opened.
 And so many people knock on the door.
 Can I tell you?
 That when you have the key you open the door and go in yourself.
 There is a clear message that we not only knock but he has given you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
 It is not about God chooses somebody and decides that they will be awesome and somebody will be average.
 One time the Lord told me, he said my son I have given you the pen of my spirit.
 You can write as glorious story as you want to write.
 It's not God who decides.
 You decide.
 He has given you his spirit.
 He has given you his spirit.
 Do you know you are walking as intimate with God as you want to walk with him right now?
 You know you are walking so close to God as you want.
 He took me back to the word.
 There was a time when Elijah is suicidal now.
 And when Elijah is sitting on the edge of the cave.
 He lifts his hand, my ministry is over.
 And the Bible says then comes fire.
 But God was not in the fire.
 And then comes earthquake.
 And the God is not in earthquake.
 And then comes whirlwind.
 And the God is not in whirlwind.
 And then comes the still small voice of God.
 And God was in that voice.
 Amen.
 See, when Hindu priest in our house used to come,
 there was lot of theatrics.
 They used to bring a bag.
 In the bag was a skull.
 And some colors and rice and squirrels tail.
 And they did like this.
 And people see that.
 Something is happening.
 Something is happening.
 And now when I got saved and you pray for people.
 In Jesus name.
 And they look at you like this.
 What?
 That's it?
 What is it?
 I was expecting like a thunder.
 A thunder.
 I was expecting.
 Oscar or?
 We need to go back to the word of God.
 We need to go to God's word.
 All the miracles that you are seeing.
 Now we are seeing spectacular things.
 All the miracles that you saw here on the screens.
 We saw spectacular things.
 But it was not how it started.
 It started with us trusting the written word of God.
 We trusted the written word.
 Just standing on the written word of God.
 We stood on the written word of God.
 And we put it in our mouths.
 Can I tell you a revival is coming and it is going to hit Europe as well.
 Can I tell you?
 There will be miracles.
 There will be signs around this.
 You will have creative miracles.
 Body organs that have been surgically reborn.
 Jesus is going to create them.
 Organs that have been taken away.
 Undeniable signs and wonders are going to happen through the hands of his people.
 Through his people.
 People that people cannot deny.
 That is why we need to go back to the word.
 I have put my words in your mouth.
 So that I can plant the heavens.
 So that I can plant the heavens.
 Taking the word of God and putting it in our mouths.
 You know when the Lord began to teach me this thing and I began to practice it.
 I got healed of that mental disorder.
 We were buried in debts.
 I just went to the word.
 You have to come to a place where you say what does the word say about myself.
 And I am going to make the written word my anchoring.
 And I am going to make the word of God my anchoring in life.
 And I am going to stand on that written word.
 And I am going to meditate on it.
 And I will speak it.
 And I will declare it.
 Until every mountain is approved from my life.
 Until every mountain has moved from my life.
 But you know we want somebody else to do heavy lifting for us.
 But you know we want somebody else to do heavy lifting for us.
 Oh pastor can you pray for me?
 I am going to eat chips and drink coke.
 I am going to eat chips and drink coke.
 Can I tell you something?
 You cannot live with someone else's faith all your life.
 You have to come to a place where you have to develop your own faith.
 You have to come to a place where you have to develop your own faith.
 You have to come to a place where you develop your own personal faith.
 I said you have to come to a place where you have to develop your own faith.
 You have to come to a place where you develop your own personal faith.
 Because this is the victory that overcomes the world and even our faith.
 It is our faith.
 If you walk in faith you will live an overcoming life.
 Then you will live a victorious life.
 I can tell you stories after stories of people whom doctors had said medical science...
 I can tell you stories after stories where doctors have said...
 For those of you who are misinformed that India doesn't have good hospitals, India has the best hospitals right now.
 And you who have got information that India shouldn't have good hospitals, we have the best hospitals.
 The best doctors.
 The best doctors in the whole world.
 We don't have to wait one month.
 If anybody wants a surgery, they can go to the hospital and get it done in half an hour.
 If anybody wants a surgery, they can go to the hospital and get it done in half an hour.
 You can ask the people here.
 But medical science, those people...
 But these people and medical...
 There is this guy who came to me and he had HIV AIDS.
 There was a person who came to me and he had HIV AIDS.
 Now he is in last stage, very sick.
 And on the last stage, very very sick.
 And he had gone to a church and somebody prayed for him.
 And he had come to a church.
 And then went to another church and nothing happened.
 He had gone to different churches and when they had prayed for him
 And he thought ok, but God doesn't want to curse me so I will just wait until he dies.
 He came to our meeting.
 He said, pray for me.
 And I said, I won't pray for you.
 Because it was clear to me that he had gone to every pastor in our town.
 So I said, I won't pray for you.
 But I can be your partner.
 I can teach you how to be healed from this sickness.
 You need to stand on the promise of God and proclaim the miracle and healing in faith.
 2 Peter 1.4 says that God has given us exceeding great and precious promises.
 God has given us exceeding great and precious promises.
 God has given us exceeding great and precious promises.
 Can you imagine if God calls something exceeding great and precious how precious and great that has to be?
 That through these promises you might become partakers of divine nature.
 You can escape the corruption that is in the world.
 I have not come here to tell you fake stories.
 I am telling you what is happening in a church where we decided to just anchor ourselves on the word of God and not give up.
 Even if we don't feel anything, see anything, but we stand and we'll keep declaring.
 The promised land in the Old Testament are the promises in the New Testament.
 So many people think that the land of Canaan represents heaven. No it does not. There are no giants in heaven.
 But they had to possess the promised land. In the same way you have to possess the promises that are in the word.
 Do you know there are 8000 promises for you?
 8000 promises.
 You know when me and my wife we were buried under debts and getting calls from bank and bank people harassing us.
 And I would go in my prayer closet and cry before God.
 Change my situation Lord. When will you move on my behalf?
 Lord I was trying my best to convince him to move on my behalf.
 Fasting, praying, crying, begging, pleading, rubbing my nose on the floor, prostrating.
 Doing something so that he gets convinced to move on my behalf.
 And one day in the middle of me crying and pleading I hear God's voice and he said stop trying to convince me.
 He said I am already convinced for your welfare. It's your heart that does not believe my written word.
 Are you getting what I'm saying?
 We think prayer is God please.
 God is not a sensitive girlfriend.
 Ok no offense our boyfriend.
 Ok no offense our boyfriend.
 We think prayer is to convince God.
 But prayer is to partner with the Father to make his will on earth.
 But pastor how should I know God's will?
 Through God's word. It is his will.
 God's word is his will.
 You already know God's will.
 What you need to do is through these precious promises you can become partakers of divine nature.
 We don't believe in this confession business.
 We don't believe in this confession business.
 We tried it and it didn't work.
 How many people here have tried to play guitar?
 Come on guys.
 If you tried playing guitar.
 Come on show me your hand like this.
 There is no tax in lifting your hand.
 There is no tax in lifting your hand.
 Now how many people gave up and you cannot play guitar today?
 That means guitar is a scam.
 That means guitar is a scam.
 That means guitar is a scam.
 Guitar is a scam.
 That means playing guitar is a scam.
 This confession business doesn't work.
 This confession business doesn't work.
 This guitar you cannot play guitar.
 You cannot play guitar.
 It's not a scam. You gave up too soon.
 It's not a scam. You gave up too early.
 Confessing the word of God is not a scam. You gave up too soon.
 It's not a scam. You gave up too early.
 We confess without quivering.
 The people who play guitar today are the ones who kept at it.
 They kept at it. Even when the fingers were paining.
 They kept at it. And when time came and breakthrough came and today they can play guitar.
 And now they can play guitar.
 In the same way there are people in the midst of their trials, in the midst of their sicknesses, in the midst of their problems, they put God's word in their mouth and they kept declaring it.
 They kept declaring it. And when time came and they were able to uproot their mountains.
 Then they needed them and they couldn't get their mountains away.
 You can breathe.
 You can breathe.
 Some are sitting there like this.
 Faith doesn't work by sight.
 The faith doesn't work by sight.
 He has told me that the culture of the kingdom of God will take over the European culture.
 So I hold on to that promise.
 Come on church, you need to get excited.
 Come on, you need to be happy for this living word of God.
 The word of God in our mouth is the answer to everything that comes against you.
 You know what I was thinking.
 Why would the Holy Spirit lead Jesus to be tempted by devil?
 Why would the Holy Spirit lead Jesus to be tempted by devil?
 Because so many people have built theologies around it that God takes us.
 No.
 Oh, so Holy Spirit led me to be tempted.
 You don't need a Holy Spirit to be tempted.
 You don't need a Holy Spirit to be tempted by your own desires.
 But for Jesus, because he was so one with the Father,
 but Jesus was so one with the Father,
 that a holy man needed to lead him to be tempted.
 So that he can show you how to defeat the devil.
 So that he can show you how to defeat the devil.
 Do you understand what I'm saying today?
 Think about this.
 Jesus goes to River Jordan, heavens open up,
 and think about this now. Jesus goes to Jordan,
 he is duped and the Holy Spirit comes over him who is a devil,
 and the earth is open,
 spectacular experience,
 the Holy Spirit comes over him,
 and he hears God's voice.
 You are my beloved Son,
 in whom I am well pleased.
 And then he is tempted,
 and the devil comes,
 and says,
 if you are the Son of God,
 my question is,
 why didn't Jesus
 refer to the encounter?
 Why didn't Jesus tell the devil,
 devil didn't you hear,
 my Father said, I am his beloved Son.
 But Jesus did not defeat the devil with an encounter.
 You know why?
 Because you and me otherwise,
 if he would have defeated the devil by encounter,
 he would have done it through this experience.
 The only way you and me could have defeated the devil,
 the only way we could have done it,
 is that we would have needed a similar experience.
 But he was setting an example for us.
 He was teaching us how every born again child of God,
 can utterly ground devil in their lives.
 He can only push down the devil in his lies.
 Jesus is the living word.
 Jesus is the living word.
 But the living word,
 pointed to the written word,
 and said it is written.
 I said the living word pointed to the written word.
 If Jesus had to point to the written word,
 how much we need to go back to the written word?
 Do you understand?
 And I am telling you, spiritual warfare is easy!
 Its easy!
 You dont have to climb high mountain.
 You dont have to scream at the devil.
 You dont have to spit at the devil.
 You don't have to pour oil on devil.
 Jesus didn't do any of that.
 He is our example.
 You know how he defeated the devil?
 He said, it is written.
 It is written.
 And guess what?
 The devil did not come against the authority of the written word.
 So many people.
 The devil is losing your lives.
 Because your mouth is shut.
 You need to tell him what is written.
 When was the last time you read the bible to the devil?
 When was the last time you tell him, you stand here.
 I am going to tell you what is written.
 The devil is written.
 Jesus said, behold I give you my power and authority to travel upon serpents and scorpions and draw back all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means harm them.
 We are always looking for a mystical encounter.
 Spiritual warfare is easy.
 Speak the word of God.
 Speak what is written.
 So this guy Amarjit, who is on the verge of dying, he took the healing scriptures.
 He was wounded for our transgression.
 He was bruised for our iniquities.
 That justice meant that our peace was upon him.
 And by his wounds we are healed.
 And you know guess what, we need to personalize the bible.
 We need to take the scripture and make it for you.
 And he began to take it and meditate it and speak it and declare it.
 Guess what happened.
 Nothing.
 Nothing.
 Do you remember this guitar example?
 When you feel it is not happening, remember this guitar example.
 He went to the doctor and got a scan of his whole body.
 And he still has HIV virus in his body.
 And he became so discouraged.
 He came to me.
 He said to me, I did what I tried but it didn't work.
 I said no.
 Keep at it.
 Hold fast the confession of your faith.
 He went back.
 Took the scripture.
 Took the promise.
 Think about it, isn't it so easy?
 We want a complicated Christianity.
 We think I'll be healed when an angel comes in my room and tells me I'm healed.
 We need to be healed when an angel comes in my room and tells me I'm healed.
 And it says that the righteous do not say who will ascend for me and go to heaven.
 They don't say who will go to heaven.
 Who will descend into the abyss?
 That is to bring Christ up.
 But what does it say?
 The word is near you.
 The word is near you.
 In your mouth and in your heart.
 In your mouth and in your heart.
 If you want the word to go into your heart, it has to go into your mouth first.
 And he went back.
 Second time went to the doctor.
 Doctor scanned him.
 The results were the same.
 But by this time, because he was meditating on the scripture, faith is the assurance.
 He got this assurance.
 No.
 Healing belongs to me.
 Because Jesus Christ has paid the price.
 You know, I love a prayer of Moravian saints.
 One of their prayer was, may the lamb of God receive the full reward of his suffering.
 May the lamb of God receive the full reward of his suffering.
 May the lamb of God receive the full reward of his suffering.
 He was wounded so that we can be healed.
 So when you get healed, it's a gift to Jesus.
 He received a reward for his suffering.
 Every time a child of God gets healed, it's a reward to his suffering.
 Every time a child of God gets healed, it's a gift to Jesus.
 He went back to the word.
 He kept speaking it.
 He went to the doctor.
 They scanned his body.
 They said, we don't find any HIV virus.
 You are absolutely healed.
 You are healed.
 But guess what?
 Sometimes we think prayer is like rubbing the lamp of Aladdin.
 But many times we think it's rubbing the lamp of Aladdin.
 If it works, if it doesn't work, it's not the will of God.
 If it works, it works.
 If it doesn't work, it's not the will of God.
 Do you know what Paul says?
 And that's what he actually says.
 He says, don't be stupid.
 You know what the will of God is.
 How do I know the will of God?
 How do I know the will of God?
 How do I know the will of God?
 The word of God is the will of God.
 Can you say this after me?
 Say the word of God.
 Oh Lord Jesus, send me back to India.
 You know, I say this in my church.
 It was easier for God to part the Red Sea rather than him to part some lips in the church.
 Can I speak a little louder in the congregation?
 Especially Scandinavian lips.
 Especially the Scandinavian lips.
 If your mouth is closed in the congregation, you don't speak out.
 If your mouth is shut, you lose by default.
 So you automatically lose.
 Because the word of God is the sword of the spirit.
 The sword has to come out of your mouth.
 If you want to live a victorious life, you will have to put the word of God in your mouth.
 And you have to come out of every victimhood.
 You are not a victim.
 You cannot be a victim and a victor together.
 You are a victim.
 You have to decide.
 I will not be a victim.
 You know, when I was mentally sick, all my friends left me.
 I was pursuing electronics and communication engineering.
 I was at the bottom of my life.
 But then when I got saved, God began to draw me back to the word.
 Me and my best friend, we came together in the kingdom.
 And Lord began to draw me to the word.
 And he began to draw me to the word.
 And he began to find me after prophecies.
 Prophecies are awesome.
 But prophecies are never a substitute for the word.
 So he would see which prophet is in the town who can give me a nice word.
 And he ran and he went to one prophet and got a word.
 Some prophets say, thus says the Lord.
 Can I tell you?
 If somebody says thus says the Lord, doesn't mean thus says the Lord.
 You need to judge every prophecy.
 You have to get an automobile business.
 You have to get an automobile business.
 With all his money he bought some cars.
 The business went down.
 That went down.
 Today, he has left faith and doesn't believe in Jesus.
 You know why?
 Because he wanted to be led by prophets.
 In the New Testament, it's unbiblical to be led by the prophets.
 In the New Covenant, we are called to be led by the Holy Spirit.
 Prophets are there to confirm what God has already told you.
 Prophets are there to confirm what God has already told you.
 I went to Africa as a missionary for two months.
 And a prophet had prophesied over me.
 He said, if you go, it is not the will of God for you to go.
 And if you go, you can die.
 I went to my room and I said, Lord, you told me to go.
 If you don't want me to go, I will not go.
 But the Lord told me, no, go, I am sending you.
 So I went.
 We had the most amazing trip.
 I came back.
 I went to meet this guy.
 He was very offended.
 Because I did not obey the prophetic word.
 So he is prophesying over me.
 The Lord is showing me.
 You are in ICU.
 With tubes all over your body.
 You are at the end of your life.
 Can I tell you?
 That's not prophetic, that's pathetic.
 That's not prophetic, that's pathetic.
 Thank God I had the word of God in my heart.
 Thank God I had the word of God in my heart.
 I said, thank you so much, sir.
 I came out of his house.
 I said, it is written, a thousand shall fall at my side.
 A thousand shall fall at my side.
 Ten thousand at my right hand.
 But it shall not come near me.
 No weapon found against me shall prosper.
 And every tongue that rises in judgment against it, I condemn it.
 And it's been more than a decade.
 And I'm not in ICU.
 And I'll not be in ICU.
 And I'll not be in ICU.
 You know why?
 Because I honor the word of the living God.
 Because I honor the word of the living God.
 And my friend, same friend, he went to the same guy.
 He went to the same guy.
 And he said, oh I'm seeing your bones are breaking.
 I see your bones are breaking.
 And the next day he was riding his bike.
 And he fell and his bones broke.
 And he fell and his leg broke.
 And he came to me and he said, why did it get fulfilled with me and not with you?
 And he said, why did it become fulfilled with me but not with you?
 I told him because you are stupid.
 I said, because you are stupid.
 You will gulp everything that is told to you.
 You swallow everything that someone says to you.
 The bible says, test every prophecy.
 But the word of God says, test every prophecy.
 Test every prophecy.
 A prophecy in the new covenant is to edify, to exalt, to exalt.
 A prophecy in the new covenant is to test it and not bind us in fear.
 Hallelujah.
 We need to come back to the word of God.
 We need to come back to the word of God.
 We need to come back to the word.
 Back to the word of God.
 Just, you know, can I tell you something?
 Can I tell you something?
 Can I tell you something?
 Speaking the word of God in your room is the most important thing.
 The word of God in your room is the most supernatural thing you can do.
 You might not feel anything.
 You know, I told you.
 You know, we have built this ministry without any support.
 Just by trusting the word of God.
 And in that time in India, pastor William knows it, pastor Christian knows it.
 It was considered impossible that you can have a thriving church.
 And people said that it was impossible to build a congregation without it coming from the west and giving money.
 But guess what?
 The Jesus in America and the Jesus in Sweden is the Jesus in India.
 Jesus in USA, Jesus in Sweden, Jesus in India.
 Amen.
 And that was the time we decided.
 We are going to look to the Lord.
 So we keep doing these pastors meeting now.
 The last meeting that we did, 30,000 pastors came together to be trained.
 And I told them one thing.
 I said we need to restore Psalm 23 in India.
 Psalm 23 is not the American is my shepherd, it is the Lord is my shepherd.
 It's not the Americans are my shepherd, it's the Lord is my shepherd.
 We need to go back to the place where we look to the Lord.
 We need to go to the place where we look to the Lord.
 Amen.
 I am telling you if you will become those people who will go to the word of God, you will have victory in every area of your life.
 If you become a person who goes to the word of God, you will be a person who has victory in every area of your life.
 Amen.
 And it's taking the word of God.
 So when we started the ministry.
 So when we started our congregation.
 So I had loans, big loans.
 And one day I read it in Ephesians 1.3.
 I had read it so many times.
 It was like the Holy Spirit breathed upon Ephesians.
 Blessed be God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
 And when I read that, I could not read further.
 The Bible says I am blessed.
 The word says I am blessed.
 I don't feel blessed at all.
 My bank doesn't feel blessed.
 My bank account doesn't feel blessed.
 My pocket doesn't feel blessed.
 But the word says I am blessed.
 So I told my wife.
 I believe this scripture with my head, it is not in my heart.
 This word was not designed for your head.
 This word was not designed for your head.
 That's why if you try to do PhD, that's pull head damage.
 If you try to get a doctor's treatment, you just get a headache.
 And that's why people have swollen heads and shrunk hearts.
 That's why people have swollen heads and shrunk hearts.
 This word was designed for your heart.
 This word is written for your heart.
 Amen.
 So I told my wife, I said I will put this word in my heart.
 I told my wife, I will put this word in my heart.
 How does it go in your heart?
 It is in your mouth.
 And in your heart.
 Say it in my mouth.
 And in my heart.
 Can you say that again?
 In my mouth.
 And in my heart.
 What do you want to put in your heart?
 Because Luke 6.45 says that.
 Because Luke 6.45 says out of the abundance of heart, mouth speaks.
 Because in Luke 6 it says, what the mouth is full of, it speaks.
 It says out of the abundance of heart, a man brings forth good things.
 And through his heart, a man carries good things.
 So I put this scripture in my heart.
 I didn't beg God, I didn't plead. Now I'm not trying to convince him.
 I'm not trying to convince him.
 I'm not trying to convince him.
 You know why?
 Because he says I am blessed.
 But my heart doesn't believe.
 So now I'm not trying to convince God.
 I'm trying to convince my heart.
 So I took the scripture and I began to meditate on it.
 Blessed be the God and father of my Lord, my Lord Jesus Christ.
 Who has blessed me with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus.
 Me and my wife, we didn't even have money to eat food.
 And we didn't even have money to buy food.
 But we paid for it in my room.
 Meditate on it.
 I thought about it, I spoke about it.
 That's what God told Joshua.
 Think about this.
 Moses was a man of encounters.
 Moses was a person who wanted to experience God.
 I love encounters with the Lord.
 And I love that we get to meet the Lord.
 But it's the word that leads us to encounter.
 But it's the word that leads us to encounter with God.
 And Moses is not able to enter the promised land.
 And now there's Joshua.
 And now God wants Joshua to possess the land.
 God doesn't give Joshua another encounter.
 You know what God gives him?
 God tells him in Joshua 1.8.
 This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night.
 This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night.
 So that you may observe to do all things that are written in it.
 For then you will make your way prosperous.
 Joshua, I will not make your way prosperous.
 When you meditate my word, you will make your way prosperous.
 It's not an event.
 Your way will be prosperous.
 And then you will have good success.
 And Joshua began to meditate the word of God day and night.
 Now think about this.
 Joshua is the only man in the Bible.
 Joshua is the only person who had the authority and who commanded celestial beings.
 He commanded the planets.
 He said, sun, be there where you are.
 Moon, be there where you are.
 And the Bible says they obeyed him.
 Joshua is the only one who has the authority to speak to the planets.
 He said the moon stands still, the sun stands still, and they obeyed him.
 If Joshua can command planets by meditating the word, don't you think you can come out of cancer?
 Joshua, if Joshua can command planets by speaking the word of God, how much do you risk?
 You can have victory over cancer.
 You can have victory over depression.
 And victory over everything that comes to you.
 This book of the law shall not depart out from your mouth.
 This law book shall not be separate from your mouth.
 Moses stands before the reti.
 He says, oh God, what should we do?
 Moses stands in front of the red sea and says, Lord, what shall we do?
 God says, Moses, why are you crying to me?
 And God says, Moses, why are you crying to me?
 Hey Moses, can you see the rod in your hand?
 Can you see the rod in your hand?
 The rod represents authority.
 You have a rod in your hand.
 Hey Moses, stretch the rod to the red ocean.
 Use the rod against the sea.
 We need to stop begging.
 We need to stop begging.
 And stand in a rightful place as a son and daughter of Almighty God.
 And stand in a rightful place as a son and daughter of Almighty God.
 With the sword of the living God coming out of our mouth.
 Amen.
 And I began to meditate the word.
 The written word will always lead you to the living word.
 Let me tell you a secret.
 How many people here want to have encounters with God?
 How many here want to have encounters with God?
 Come on, not a trick question.
 If you want to have an encounter, come and show me your hand.
 Every scripture is a door to encounter.
 Every scripture is a door to encounter.
 Every scripture becomes a portal.
 When you stay at it and meditate it.
 It's like a road when you stand and meditate and think about it.
 Because I meditated Ephesians 1, 3, 4 months.
 So you have been thinking about this for a month.
 When I was meditating, I heard the voice of the Lord in my heart.
 And he said, my son, I make a covenant with you today.
 As long as you live, you will never see lack in your life.
 And it's been more than 12 years.
 I do not know what lack is.
 Not because of anything that I have done.
 But because I got the Word.
 I got the Word.
 I got the Word and it will be real for me.
 Amen.
 I'm telling you, and today what we are doing in India.
 What we do in India and what is happening.
 Recently the meeting that we went, 500,000 people showed up.
 And at a meeting that we had, a campaign that we had, 500,000 people came.
 It's a state which has anti-conversion law.
 Where police will put you behind bars if you preach the gospel.
 But you know what we began to do in our room?
 We began to speak the Word.
 Whatever you bind on earth, will be bound in heaven.
 Whatever you lose on earth, shall be lost in heaven.
 We are not powerless people.
 We are people of authority.
 And now India has opened up.
 Different states, all the pastors are coming together and they are calling us.
 700,000 people.
 One million people.
 In the states, where it is illegal to preach.
 They are illegally, to publicize.
 So the pastors will be so free-minded.
 People will be healed.
 Once my son told me.
 My word, it comes out of you like a seed.
 But it comes out of you like a two-edged sword.
 So many times you see somebody you say, oh man.
 Look at this man of God.
 I have come to Sweden to tell you, it's not about the man of God, it's about the word of God.
 You become the man of God who has the word of God in your mouth.
 Fill your heart with the word.
 Shall we start the preaching?
 Pastor Wille tell me.
 That you don't have much time.
 I see spears flying towards me.
 In India we started to have these prayer meetings online.
 On Fridays we gather people to pray at night.
 From late evening to early morning.
 Once the pastor told me, a praying church is a victorious church.
 To make the long message short.
 The two basic choices.
 That you put the word of God in your mouth.
 And the second.
 I know there is a lot of controversy around it.
 That it doesn't work.
 But it works very well for us.
 And that is to pray in the Holy Spirit.
 You can take these two things.
 Just proclaim the word of God in your mouth.
 And then you pray in the Holy Spirit.
 Then I will tell you.
 You will be a threat to the devil.
 We start to have these marathons where we pray in the spirit.
 We want to revive their hearts.
 Because the prayer in tongues is a gate to the supernatural.
 Can I say it again?
 That's why the devil hates it.
 These people are saying gibberish.
 It doesn't work.
 They are wasting their time.
 I tell people now it's too late.
 It's too late for us.
 Because look what is happening in India.
 When a church goes back to the raw word of God.
 And takes time to pray in the Holy Spirit.
 A nation that was shut for the Gospel.
 God has opened the curtain now.
 From the top of India to the bottom of India.
 We are singing the revival of the Holy Spirit.
 Jude says the world is going to become worse and worse.
 But you beloved, can you turn to your neighbor and say you beloved?
 The world is going to get worse and worse.
 And David encouraged himself in the Lord.
 And David was happy in the Lord.
 You didn't get the joke.
 That's probably my fault.
 That's probably my fault. I'm sorry.
 You know when I come to Europe I have to constantly encourage myself in the Lord.
 Like David encouraged himself in the Lord.
 Come on turn to your neighbor and say but you beloved.
 Build yourself up.
 Praying in the Holy Ghost.
 It's not God who decides how much built up you can be.
 You decide.
 But you beloved.
 Build yourself up.
 Praying in the Holy Spirit.
 Hallelujah.
 There are so many people.
 You were baptized but you don't pray in tongues anymore.
 And because you don't.
 God has sent a man from India.
 To remind you.
 How beautiful that gift is.
 How beautiful that gift is.
 Don't despise praying in the Holy Spirit.
 I said don't despise praying in the Holy Spirit.
 You know one time I was praying in the Holy Ghost.
 Me and three people.
 And suddenly the Lord put this in my heart.
 How many people here want to walk in the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit?
 It's for you.
 It's not just for a few chosen, frozen men of God.
 It is for every born again, spiritual child of God.
 Come on.
 The Bible says earnestly desire spiritual gifts.
 Come on.
 It's easy.
 Pray much in the Holy Spirit.
 You know a man of God called Smith Wigglesworth.
 He used to say.
 He said.
 Before my feet touches the floor.
 Tongues come out of my mouth.
 He had trained himself when he gets up.
 Before he looks for coffee.
 Coffee thank you.
 Coffee thank you.
 Before he looks for coffee.
 He began to pray in the Holy Spirit.
 Day after day.
 Because when you pray in the Holy Spirit.
 When you pray in the spirit.
 You are praying the perfect prayers.
 So you pray the perfect prayers.
 So the Lord told me.
 There is somebody in the church.
 They are about to meet with an accident and they will die.
 That there is someone in the church that will meet with an accident and they will die.
 Romans 8.26 says we have a weakness.
 We don't know what we should pray for as we ought.
 Romans 8 says we have a weakness.
 We don't know what we should pray for.
 But the spirit himself makes intercession for us and through us.
 But the spirit prays for us with sugar without words.
 In reality with God.
 So I began to pray.
 Because I don't know who that is.
 I began to pray in the Holy Spirit.
 After 20 minutes the burden was lifted up.
 After 20 minutes the burden was lifted up.
 And I got a call from this girl who is a manager in American Express Bank in our church.
 She called me and said pastor.
 We met with a terrible accident.
 She showed the picture.
 The police had to cut the doors to bring these guys out.
 The cars were already destroyed.
 One scratch on anyone inside the car.
 They didn't have a single scratch on anyone inside the car.
 If you only pray with your intellect.
 Then you pray with the prayer beads that are limited.
 Because your intellect is limited.
 But if you pray in tongues.
 If you pray in the Holy Spirit.
 Then you pray with unlimited prayers.
 Then you pray with prayer beads without limits.
 Because he knows everything.
 So in the last 12 years in our congregation we have only had four burials.
 If you want to die early then go to this congregation.
 I'm not kidding.
 There are so many people who have started attacking me in India.
 We have to be selfish.
 Don't be selfish and pack your bags and say Jesus is coming.
 Jesus is coming but we are not going to be selfish.
 We are going with millions of souls.
 We are going with great harvest.
 We are going with souls and we are going with a big harvest.
 So listen to this.
 If there is anybody here.
 You are not filled with the Holy Spirit.
 Or you are.
 But you allowed that gift.
 You despised that gift.
 You allowed that gift to die out.
 Then we are going to pray for the spirit to come over you.
 And we are going to pray for the whole of this.
 Because Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever.
 He was the healer. He is the healer.
 He is the healer. He will always be the healer.
 But before we pray for the sick.
 We are going to pray for the sick.
 Anybody who wants that fresh impartation of the Holy Spirit.
 I want you to quickly come forward.
 And worship him if you can.
 And the song of the promise can come up.
 And if you want a healthy meeting with the Holy Spirit.
 Then you can come forward.
 If you want to say Lord I want this fresh baptism.
 And if you want this healthy interdope.
 I will not despise this gift anymore.
 I will not look down on this gift anymore.
 I am telling you your Christianity will be so exciting.
 Your Christ will be so changed.
 Come on. Come on. Come on.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you Lord Jesus.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 And can we all stand up please.
 We all in the hall can we stand up.
 We can stand up.
 Okay can I tell you something.
 Jesus never force feeds anyone.
 Jesus never force anyone.
 You will only be filled according to the measure of your hunger.
 You will be filled in unity with your own hunger.
 He will never force himself on you.
 One of the most beautiful gift that you can have is the hunger.
 One of the most beautiful gift that you can have is the hunger.
 How many people here you have never prayed in tongues?
 How many here have never prayed in tongues?
 If you have never prayed in tongues you can raise your hand.
 Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Well tonight is your night.
 And how many people here you got filled.
 How many here you got filled.
 But somebody told you it is not important that you haven't prayed in tongues for a long time.
 But someone has said that it is not so important that you haven't prayed in tongues for a long time.
 You can raise your hand also.
 If you are hungry.
 If you are hungry.
 Then the Lord will pour out his Spirit.
 Will pour out his Spirit.
 Will pour out his Spirit.
 And the Lord's eyes will see after.
 He doesn't need a big name.
 He needs a humble, yielded vessel.
 He needs a humble, yielded vessel.
 That says look before my flesh goes back to mud.
 Use me for your glory.
 That says before I go back to earth, use me Lord.
 Come on for a moment.

 Now hear this. Whenever Jesus healed somebody in the Bible, he told them to do something they could not do before.
 A man with a third hand, he said, stretch forth your hand. And as they did what they were not able to do, healing manifested.
 So many times, the healing doesn't manifest because they don't do what they could not do before.
 So come on, quickly, do something you were not able to do before. Check your hearing. Check your sight. Lift your hand. Do something that you were not able to do before.
 Check that tumour. Come on, come on, come on. Jesus is in the house. Let that deaf ear pop open now. Do something. If you are not able to walk, get up and walk.
 If you can't walk, get up and walk. Lift up your hand. Come on, now look at me. Show me if you are healed. Lift your hand if you are healed.
 Praise God. Come on. Who else? Come on, lift your hand. Come on, come on, come on.

 Hallelujah. Who else? Who else wants to testify? Thank you Lord Jesus. Amen, amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 Okay, can we celebrate like we do in India? Is it okay? Can we celebrate like we do in India? Is it okay?
 Okay, we want to end a service in victory. Okay, we want to end every good service in victory. We start with victory.
 We finish with victory. Amen. Okay, and I'll show you some Indian dance moves.
 I'll show you some Indian dance moves. Okay, can we dance in the presence of the Lord?
 Can we dance in the presence of the Lord right now? The Bible says, let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice exceedingly.
 Let them rejoice and praise the Lord. Can we have some joyful song? We can dance together. Amen.
 If you are in Christ, you are blessed. If you are in Christ, you are blessed. If you are in Christ, let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice exceedingly.
 Amen. That means your neighbor, when you rejoice, should think, what's his problem?
 When your neighbor is happy, you shouldn't think, what's her problem? Why is he so happy? Why is he so happy?
 Because the joy of the Lord is us. Because the joy of the Lord is us. Amen. Are you ready?

 We are now finishing the show here in Porn. What a crowd it is in the studio and in the whole place.
 You almost get to scream, but wow, what a meeting.
 We hope you feel blessed out there, that you have really received something from God this evening.
 Theo, what can you say after such an evening?
 I don't even know where to start, but I like this kind of thing, I must say.
 I like it very much and this gives me a lot of flashbacks to the 80s and 90s.
 In the 80s it was a very clear, radical education and confirmation.
 And in some way it feels like Ankit has it all over his life, this spirit of faith.
 It's not a question of opinion, we just believe in this.
 And it's the Word that counts, it's not what we feel, it's not what we experience, it's the Word all the way.
 But then it's fantastic, challenging at the same time.
 At least I think so, but it's good to be challenged, isn't it?
 I think so. That's what we're going to be.
 And I think that every meeting we have been challenged.
 And I think it will continue during the conference.
 And from Brandys too, it's not just about being challenged, we also have to take the step.
 What do we do with it?
 That's right, and we can say that we are very happy that it's only half of the conference so far.
 Absolutely.
 My experience of the conference is that it's growing all the way.
 Now we're not sitting here alone, we're going to try and in this pressure of permission,
 we're going to talk a little more about Mission and India, because we have with us
 Edgert Mannighed and Thea Hamre.
 Very fun, I don't know if you can hear us.
 Yes, I can hear you.
 Yes, you can hear us a little.
 We have talked a lot about Asia tonight, not least.
 Will people who will soon become Vietnamese, or at least if they move there.
 A focus on 1040 windows, and in the south-east, or what should we say, the south-east part,
 I have to call it then, where actually half of the earth's population lives.
 It's hard to just imagine.
 But there is an incredible openness to the Gospel.
 You both have personal experience and connection to India.
 If we start with you Thea, you have been living in India for a while.
 Yes, exactly.
 I was given the permission to move down three years ago now, and lived there for two years,
 and got to work with Bible schools.
 We have had Bible schools in India since 2011 or something like that,
 so it's a long-term job, which I got to be a little piece of the puzzle
 and then move on and then leave it to the local population.
 And then you were based in Calcutta, right?
 Yes, exactly. In north-east India, in Calcutta.
 How is the situation with Bible schools in India now, or if we speak in the autumn here?
 Yes, exactly. I know that they are on their way to do at least a guided training mission course
 because for this Bible school, we have Bible schools that are going on for the first year.
 But it's a whole bunch that are really excited to get out into this with mission, leadership and meeting planning.
 So they will do a course where they combine leadership and mission and all these things,
 and really get ready. So that's really great.
 Very great. I feel like we're not really finished with this meeting,
 but before we go back to that, because this was also India, and a little surprising maybe,
 that God raises up a person who is anointed and who really gets to touch the country.
 It's not easy to be a Christian in India today, we know that, and it's closed in many ways,
 but it's a little typical and it works. The darkness and the light go forward in parallel and so on.
 But before we talk more about you, I'm so excited about this, I feel.
 But Red Yet, you also work with Indian Children.
 Yes, that's right.
 We heard a little more about you yesterday, maybe some of the listeners tonight also were there.
 But tell us a little bit about the work and how it works.
 Yes, absolutely. It was founded by Birgitta Ekman in 1998,
 and then it was a foundation that would support the various works.
 But then over the years it developed so that we have our own employees today,
 and now it has become a foundation, so it has grown a lot.
 Right now we support 450 children, I think, in different ages.
 And then it's always from that they live in girls' and boys' homes, it's in Jarkhand,
 a little north of Calcutta and the West Bengal.
 And then in Calcutta we have a father program where they get education,
 they get school clothes, they get attention,
 they also get to learn to know God, who he is.
 And that's when Hinduism is not officially like that,
 or the caste system does not live on, but the thoughts live on.
 So that a person's life is not so much worth it because you think that
 you are born into the next life, so to get up from something
 or to see someone else is not as valuable.
 That's what they get when they come to God.
 Oh, today I can celebrate my life.
 So it's a broad work, we are so happy, as Teja said, that the locals have taken over.
 It's so fun to see that they have gone to Bible school 10-15 years ago,
 and now they themselves are ambassadors to go to really rich people
 and they see them as a huge step, that Indians see their own Indians.
 I think so.
 So that's what it looks like right now.
 But the focus is on the children, to meet the needs of the children.
 That's right.
 I often think that when you take care of the children,
 you get the families on the buy.
 Did that work in India?
 Absolutely, it is.
 When they come to us, they are around six years old,
 so there are families behind, or relatives in different ways.
 We have had so many witnesses, that we have been there for a long time,
 so schools have had a good reputation.
 Even if you are not a believer, you may be Hindu or Muslim,
 then you know that at that school the teachers care,
 that you want to put your children there.
 And when they notice that,
 oh, my children are actually starting with good values in the home,
 which even lifts the whole home, then they become curious.
 So there are several people who have come to believe,
 because their children have been allowed to go to our schools.
 But absolutely, the whole family is affected,
 especially the way of thinking, I think.
 So you dare to extend yourself to something else, you dare to put your children there.
 And then maybe even parents realize,
 but I want to help my children with homework.
 Then it suddenly becomes interesting,
 but maybe I should start studying.
 I did not do that before, but now it becomes one plus one,
 or just simple things.
 It creates a desire for life in a different way for the whole family,
 which we think is wonderful.
 Fantastic, wonderful.
 If we talk about Asia, also a little moment here,
 then Ville is a fireman here as usual.
 For this, there are few who can inspire as much as Ville here.
 But it is exciting with the development, I think,
 which is the mission work against Asia,
 against all these so close-knit parts of the world.
 What did he say?
 Was it 99% of all Hindus there in this circle that we saw on the map,
 and 98% of all Buddhists?
 It feels like a huge challenge.
 But I was actually thinking, I should not be the one to talk here,
 but I was thinking, what a challenge the Soviet Union was
 when the word of life started in the 80s.
 It was impossible to just overlook, there were nine time zones,
 there were as many people as possible,
 there was nothing that worked,
 it was just crazy from start to finish.
 But look what God has done.
 It's fantastic.
 And now we will see how God breaks out.
 I think we are on the broad front here.
 Do you call it the race of the bot?
 Yes, we leave geography.
 This is not a school for her.
 I lost the sound here, I think.
 But shall we go back to the meeting?
 I have to hear a little how you experienced the whole Redjett and Thea.
 We love meetings.
 I think you agree with that.
 There are different kinds of meetings, all meetings are not the same.
 That's nice, because there are many different needs.
 But now you experience something about this evening.
 What do you take with you from this evening?
 I think it's just so fantastic with the courage that Ankit brought with him in the Friedrich.
 He was here last year too, it was exactly the same thing.
 It's just fantastic to be a complete comfort that God's word is God's word and his will is in God's word.
 It's so nice to have such a clear preacher who is so open to that.
 It's very easy to start to complicate and try to find our own ways around things.
 But God's word is God's word and he is faithful and stands by his word.
 It's just fantastic to be reminded and challenged by that.
 I agree.
 What I take with me is that he has lived a life, it's something that is real.
 And then it brings strength.
 And I love this manifested presence of God.
 We know that he exists, of course.
 And it's not about feelings, but when he gets really close, it's not possible to get away from him.
 And then the faith and expectations increase.
 And that we are many together, it's not something in numbers.
 But when the faith comes together, it becomes a little special.
 And you just pull each other.
 So I thought it was wonderful.
 And the space, both God's word, but also the word of God, the God-revealing word.
 And the sound of it to a holy Ghandhoje, he has space.
 You love that.
 This one, if it just bubbles up when he starts to ask for tongues, then it's like, yes!
 This is what we're going to have!
 Revive the gift of grace.
 It's not cramping, it flows out.
 Because God is so close.
 You love that, so you will live on for a long time.
 Even as you said, there is more, but tonight.
 It was a little longer meeting than we might have been used to.
 I don't know about all the different preferences.
 But I watched a part of Ankit's charity from Delhi.
 And there the broadcast is usually between four and five hours.
 But it's no one who looks sad or seems to go home.
 People are there.
 And I think that sometimes we ourselves do a disservice when we think that we want God.
 But we fix this little format.
 We have this, we could call it a box.
 Two hours, maybe a little less.
 The coffee is cold.
 And then we think that God should do everything.
 God who is outside, he is eternal God.
 He is outside of time and space.
 And then we miss so much.
 Because we don't just stay.
 Or stay out, as Ankit talked about.
 But I have earned it.
 We are not hungry in the same way.
 I was in India for the first time in 2005 on a mission trip.
 And then you went to these little villages in the bush.
 People came from long distances to come to these meetings.
 If the meeting was one and a half hours, then they would say no, I'm not going home yet.
 It's four or five hours.
 They have come to listen to God's word.
 Sing praises, have community.
 And that's the highlight of the week.
 We don't leave here because we have received this.
 I don't think we come to church on Sundays so often with the hunger.
 Now I come just to receive God's word.
 It's the same if I come several hours away.
 But I want God's word today.
 I agree.
 It makes a huge difference.
 We have a meeting tomorrow evening with Ankit again.
 But before that, a lot will happen.
 Tomorrow, I will not remember.
 I'm so caught up in what has happened tonight.
 It's a lot of sun and ice.
 A lot of sun, yes.
 And then there are a lot of seminars during the day.
 If you are on the spot, you can come and take part of it.
 And then we have the evening meeting with Ankit again.
 And then we have the before and after the studio.
 Both in the morning and evening meeting.
 Yes, we have.
 And now there were many who came here in the morning.
 And a lot of people witnessed that God had touched them very specifically.
 And I think that God probably touched you who were with us online or via the channel.
 It would be so nice if you would write a series or hear about it in some way through the channels that exist.
 And tell us about this.
 Then we can give honor to God.
 And just as we heard, it is something that becomes a celebration.
 Something that is confirmed in and with that we witness it.
 So we really encourage you.
 And if it doesn't happen tonight,
 then we do just as Ankit criticized them.
 We don't let go of God, but we continue to speak out His word.
 And we continue to trust Him.
 And then it will be, as I said, a new occasion tomorrow night.
 I am relatively sure that it will be prepared for sick even tomorrow night.
 I think so.
 We have such hope for these meetings and the whole conference, the seminars and everything.
 So it is really fun that you are with us and watching.
 And we hope that you will follow us all week.
 Until Sunday.
 I thought we would end here with a swish.
 And they have done something else here tonight on Tuesday, I think it was.
 Yes, right.
 And we do it together with Life's Word.
 And that is why we have here tonight also employees from Life's Word.
 Because we want to show that we are here from Life's Word and we do this together.
 These seminars have cost-effects both from Life's Word and Life's Word.
 But we want to bring together a little love gift to be able to continue these seminars.
 And also to be able to put 50% into Life's Word's different work.
 Which also means the missions in India and Vietnam and all these places that you are working.
 And I think it is really fun that you can sign two jobs through one swish.
 Yes, it is a bit double blessing.
 And the incredible media work that Kanal 10 and Kristian Media in Sweden are doing.
 And through this swish, I am here with my phone and will be here with you.
 I have to be here too.
 I will read the swish number to you who want to be here.
 And this is a voluntary gift and it will sign both Kristian Media in Sweden.
 To bring out the Gospel and Life's Word work out in the world.
 The swish number is 123 695 50 90.
 I will read it one more time.
 123 695 50 90.
 And then you write in a envelope that you want to swish there.
 And then we go on to the bank account and write in.
 And then we sign and it turns nice and green.
 And thank you all who are here, but also thank you who are here in B√∂rn for these works.
 And it means a lot that you are here to watch.
 And we hope that these broadcasts tomorrow will be a well-signaled one too.
 We are back 09.55 from the studio.
 Thank you, Thea and Gredje for coming by.
 It is so exciting to hear from those who have not only heard about it, but are actually part of it.
 God bless you in your work and see you all tomorrow.
 Have a good one.
