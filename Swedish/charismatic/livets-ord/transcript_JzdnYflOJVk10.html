[Transcription: Whsiper Medium - English]

 Today we heard you as a preacher in the morning.
 If I were to turn to you and ask you about your first European conference, when was that?
 It must have been 1985 I think.
 1985? Then I had to teach myself yesterday and it was a conference.
 Then it was called the trust conference.
 And then we were not here of course, but then we were in Gränby hall I think.
 So that was a while ago. Then we went here in 1987. So that was fun.
 If you just for our viewers, would you say something about that conference versus a conference of today?
 Yes, that conference was a bit special. It ended up on the first pages in Swedish media.
 It ended up on TV and then Ulf Ekman talked about socialism being a part of the devil.
 I don't think everyone was involved in that.
 But what I thought was very special was when he talked about the Soviet Union coming into Sweden.
 There was a fear for this, even in the Swedish Christianity.
 No, Sweden is going to take the Soviet Union. And this was 1985.
 Then it didn't take long before we could actually get over there and get into the Soviet Union.
 So it was a very special conference actually. I would say that it is a bit of a church history in the Swedish context anyway.
 But if you put it in relation to what we get to experience here and now, what do you say?
 Yes, it really goes on. It's wonderful. The fact is that if we take POBOM in 1987, there are many friends here from that time.
 But what is also exciting is that there are many young people coming.
 I recognize myself from that time when I was a young person who was at the beginning of my journey with the Lord.
 The early years in life are very important.
 I had the most wonderful, the year-end meeting of gods that sent me on this course.
 That is one of our real blessings before such a conference.
 It is precisely what is going to happen. It will be personal meetings with Jesus.
 When he gets caught, just like with Peter, Andreas, Jacob and Johannes, come follow me, I will do you to the fishmonger.
 I am very impressed by seeing so many different types of people.
 Different nationalities of course, but also different generations who meet in a common longing.
 You were talking yesterday about the hunger that drove us in the early 80s into wanting to go, as we said, completely full with God.
 It is in a way the same thing today.
 Yes, it is. That is why it is so important that there are, we who are here and arrange these conferences, we must live there ourselves.
 There must be, a place is created where it is normal to be present.
 The normal thing is to be allowed to be here.
 The normal thing is to expect that the Lord will take me on a journey into the future he has for me.
 If we do not have that, and live there ourselves, I do not think that you can lead other people to that place either.
 That is something I am thinking about what we are talking about now.
 I do not know if you noticed, when they opened the doors here, people were flowing in.
 It is almost a little well-hectic, one might say, because everyone wants to be shown a good place.
 It is a wonderful sign of hunger, I think.
 And it has always been a word of life, more or less.
 I think it is more now, which I am actually happy about.
 Because it means a lot, it says something about what expectations there are.
 Expectations, yes, but it is faith. It was a faith conference, now we call it the European conference, but it is about the same thing.
 It is about trusting God, that he wants to do something with us and through us.
 Christian, we will never get to hear about your thoughts on the mission now.
 But you have been with us during this whole journey.
 And you are also in a certain amount of PO.
 But the interesting thing I see is that these young people who come in now, when you meet them,
 they do not have a lot of experience. We are talking about a little bit of church history, but 40 years is quite a long time.
 And what is it called, DNA, or what is it that is so unique that you feel,
 that we just want to take from generation to generation, into the next phase now?
 I would say that we are very focused. We really know what we want to transfer to the nation.
 And you use the word DNA, and we are very aware of our DNA.
 Our DNA is the gospel for the customers, it is the teaching of faith,
 which is the equipment of people, it is life in a whole legend and it is a mission.
 It is the core that we want to transfer. And it is very attractive, because it is about an supernatural life.
 If you are a young person, you often long for why I am on this planet.
 Is there anything more with this than that I should be a Volvo-villa, as they say.
 You want to get hold of this, what is the Lord for me?
 And then the teaching of faith is what can bring me into another type of life.
 It is supernatural to be led by the Holy One. The Holy One sees behind the corner what I cannot know,
 but it is what he can lead me into. And it also gives me strength and courage,
 and supernatural strength to go into that.
 And then the mission is the mission, and I think that is incredibly attractive for young people.
 I feel that that is what makes people want to do it.
 Then you start to ask yourself, I have been doing this for a while, tell me.
 We have a lot of conversations with people who are 20-30 years younger than us, maybe 40 years younger.
 It is very, very fun. We want to get out of our experience, but of course let the younger generations get their own.
 Mission, yes, Christian. We love that, we love to talk about it.
 Life is much bigger abroad than here in Sweden.
 And some people think that they do not know about it, but they associate life with the meeting in Uppsala,
 which is a self-evident center.
 Can you describe a little bit how the mission work right now looks like?
 What are the highlights?
 We usually joke, it has almost become my internal joke, even if it is not.
 We focus on Europe and Asia, and then you say, that sounds very small.
 But it has developed and become that.
 It started at the end of the 80s, and then it was called Eastern Europe.
 And except for Europe and Sweden and Scandinavia, of course,
 we experienced before it started to open up seriously, into the Soviet world.
 Then a few years later we experienced a step further, into Central Asia.
 And then we started at the same time with the meeting in Moscow, where we appointed missionaries.
 So before, within three years, we had sent out 70 missionaries from there, down in Caucasus and Central Asia.
 And then it also talks about India, where we also work very intensively.
 And then it has gone further into Vietnam and China.
 Vietnam, the work is growing colossally.
 It is about 20 years old in Vietnam, even though we worked with Vietnamese in Russia before.
 And today it is perhaps 250, it depends on, I do not know exactly how they count,
 but they say the latest figures have been 280 meetings.
 And it just grows. So I will get new figures next time I meet them.
 And then they say, but do not worry, we will reach 2000 meetings before 2030, I think.
 And we are not worried about that, of course, it is just very exciting.
 So we have a very, I would say, varied, I usually joke and say,
 so in the beginning, in the 80s, the average life span was Scandinavian,
 then it became a little more Slavic, and then it became a little darker,
 hard in Caucasus and Central Asia, a little more brown in India,
 and then a little yellowish bronze color in China and Vietnam.
 So the average life span today, I would like to make a fun picture of it today.
 But we are, as you say, much larger abroad than in Sweden.
 One of the largest meetings, or one is in Armenia, there are 8-9000 members in Moscow,
 7000 members, and there are other big meetings as well.
 So it is the big meetings, but in total we are closer to 1000 meetings today.
 And this is growing, and about half of our meetings are in Asia.
 So now we will bring them together again in November for an Asian summit.
 So that will be very fun, you may come along, Pio.
 We will see how it goes with you, I would like to choose when to do it.
 So that will be very exciting, really.
 I can not let it be, just ask the question.
 How do you find the title, the right kind of crazy?
 You have to be the right kind of crazy, I think.
 The right kind of crazy.
 It naturally arouses a lot of thought, but under the heading
 freedom in faith in a confused world.
 But the right kind of crazy.
 There are really two sides of it, I would say.
 To start with, being crazy is not something famous,
 and the Bible warns us from being crazy and stupid and so on.
 But on the other hand, a genuine, balanced, but strong
 and free-minded belief is perceived as crazy.
 The atheist thinks the believer is crazy.
 Here on the cover we have the right plane.
 It starts with a dream like Da Vinci, and then I go back to antiquity,
 and I see a lot of people dreaming about flying.
 But Da Vinci was drawing planes and helicopters.
 And then you spend 400 years trying to get it up,
 and everyone thinks these crazy people who are doing these things,
 until it was the right kind of crazy.
 So the Wright brothers got it up in 1902, 1903 and so on.
 Today when I sit in the airplane I do not think this is crazy,
 I think, does wifi work? Is there any good coffee at this place?
 How is it with knees? Do I get space?
 I have good space.
 So it's not crazy anymore, right?
 So what was crazy became the right kind of crazy.
 And the faith is just the same. Noah builds an ark,
 everyone thinks he's crazy until it starts to rain.
 And then it was not crazy anymore.
 And that's how faith works.
 And it can be crazy for observers who have not themselves
 heard the word from the Lord.
 But for those who have heard the word from the Lord,
 I think Noah is very, very brave.
 But I also talk about these overdrives that can come when it comes to
 that a feger does not just believe to jump out and hope that it will work.
 I usually say that balance is best when you are the most balanced.
 When you lie on the floor, then nothing can balance you.
 But it's not a place we want to be passive.
 If you're going to climb up in a tree, you're not going to climb out on the branch.
 That will not work, that is not balance.
 If you keep your feet close to the trunk, it can come high.
 So faith is not unbalanced, untouched.
 And I want to touch on some of the overdrives here too.
 But the basic tone is of course that God can do incredible things.
 There are a lot of mission stories there with quite a few examples.
 So I think it will be very encouraging.
 Is this a form of a Christian testament to this young generation we are talking about?
 Yes, partly.
 I have written a book before this one, which I think is even more directed to the younger generation.
 It's called Moodra.
 Or dare, you should just dare, it's called in Swedish.
 Dare is called in English.
 And it is written more from the fact that through the years I have seen,
 partly experienced my own coldness and noticed what challenges are waiting for me along the way.
 What questions do I have to solve?
 What kind of attacks can come?
 Questioning.
 And then I have also observed others, of course, who just think about why they left.
 And then I have identified, I think, 17-18 chapters where there are different areas.
 And there I do my best to give advice on how to take it further and actually fulfill your calling.
 So these are actually connected.
 Exciting.
 Now it is so that we are in the middle of the conference.
 These studio talks that we have, they are actually for us to give you who are watching a little bit of bonus menu, a little plus menu.
 Here is the conversation, here you get deepening, here you get to meet people who exist, here on the word of life.
 And as an important part in the whole of the conference.
 But of course, the God service, what goes against it.
 But we are back, PO, you and I, after the God service.
 We will be here, you will meet more.
 We will also do a little free-mode gathering, which we share between the words of life and our activity.
 For the vision that God has put on our hearts, we just want to expand.
 We are in the middle of this here and now.
 Now we are there, PO, and what do you see for tonight?
 Tonight we will listen to Brandy Carano, who comes from Barcelona.
 Fantastic, talented entrepreneur, an energy-saving, straight up and down.
 So it will be a treat, as they say in Germany.
 And then sit down and eat and don't miss a moment.
 And then we will be back when the God service goes to its end.
 We usually say, we say it again, tips please, if you know friends.
 Play.kanal10.se, there you can see this or on YouTube or Facebook.
 Go in and watch now, be a part of the God service.
 Above all, know that Jesus Christ is not only here, but he is close to you.
 And it is our prayer and it is our desire that you should experience God together with us, who are actually here too.
 Jesus is on your and our side.
 Now we hand over to the God service.
 Before we do, let me just mention that if you are sitting and in need, maybe need medicine, healing, need a video of God,
 listen to us, bonatlivetsord.se and then we stand together with you in prayer and faith,
 for God to meet you where you are.
 Now it's time for the God service. God bless you.
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let everything, let everything, let us pray, let us pray. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
 A praise in the valley, a praise on the mountain.
 A praise when offshore, a praise when valley.
 A praise when upnumbered, a praise when surrounded.
 A praise in the waters, my enemies drowning.
 As long as I'm breathing, I've got a reason to praise the Lord, oh my soul.
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul.
 A praise when I'm feeling, a praise when I don't.
 A praise because I know you're still in control.
 A praise is a weapon, it's for the sound.
 A praise is a shout that brings terrible doubt.
 As long as I'm breathing, I've got a reason to praise the Lord, oh my soul.
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul.
 I won't be quiet, my body's alive, how could I keep it inside?
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul.
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
 Praise cause you're sorry, praise cause you're ready. Praise cause you're rose and defeated and great.
 Praise cause you're faithful, praise cause you're true. Praise cause there's nobody greater than you.

 Let everything, let us pray. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
 Let everything, let us pray. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
 We're here to worship you. We're here to lift up your name, Jesus.
 The name above all names. We worship you, Jesus.
 We proclaim your name tonight.
 He shames, He shames heavy-eyed all.
 He reigns with our eyes closed.
 He goes by the name of Jehovah, Jehovah.
 He speaks into my faith.
 And darkness comes running.
 He goes by the name of Jehovah, Jehovah.
 So call the name, call the name, call the name, call the name, Jehovah.
 All our praise, all our praise, all our praise belongs to him.
 His voice will reach my way.
 He's fighting for science.
 There's no other God alive.

 Listen, you can sit down for about 10 seconds.
 About 10 seconds.
 I'm super happy to say this.
 It's super fun to see so many faces.
 Do you meet some famous faces?
 Do you meet some new faces?
 I'm so happy to be able to say that John and Brandy Carano have also joined us here tonight.
 Through a big applause.
 I'm very happy that Brandy is here tonight because she's going to speak.
 So that's great.
 But I'm also very happy that Ankit has joined us here tonight, and Neha Mai from India.
 Through a big applause as well.
 We are so grateful to have you here.
 But we usually do this in the beginning.
 We're still in the beginning of the conference.
 We usually do this.
 We look at each other a little bit, so we can really feel each other's pulse.
 So we have to look at who's here.
 You who are with us online, may God bless you.
 But we have to start with my favorite country.
 There's a favorite country in the world.
 Norway.
 Do we have any Norwegians here tonight?
 Come on now.
 I don't understand what kind of countries there are in the world.
 Here's a table that has only created Norway.
 But we'll let it go now.
 But just to check a little bit here as well.
 Do we have any who have travelled really, really far
 and come outside of Europe, so have travelled in here?
 Can we hear you?
 Do we have some people from outside?
 You've travelled longer than Europe.
 Outside Europe.
 Okay. Pretty good.
 Brazil is pretty good actually.
 Come on.
 Okay, do we have some people, not Scandinavian now,
 but do we have some people from Europe?
 Europe shall be saved.
 Do we have some people?
 Do we have any Swedes here tonight?
 I thought about it when I planned this.
 I thought I had to come after Norway, so we get a chance to beat them.
 Thank you Jesus.
 But now we know each other, right?
 Very good, very good.
 But you have the opportunity to get to know each other
 so much more during the conference.
 And do it.
 Meet someone new.
 Do it.
 I really want to encourage you to do it.
 Okay, now I want to hand over to the screens.
 You'll get to see something good here.
 Self-sufficient energy.
 Warm welcome to the second evening of the European Conference.
 Let's go.
 Yes.
 See you tonight and yesterday.
 Were you in the area a little?
 Yes, I turned on the glass tent. It was very warm.
 Yes, I think many did it.
 I saw many of you there.
 Yes, it was fantastic.
 So we have a lot to look forward to tonight. Tell us.
 We really have.
 We will have a book release today, which is extra exciting.
 Christian Åkjellman released a book called The Right Kind of Mad.
 Maybe a book for me.
 Yes, maybe for you too.
 And if you are interested in the book, we just want to say that it will be a signature after the meeting.
 And tomorrow we have our friend Brandy Corona with us for her seminar at 13.00.
 Don't miss that.
 Yes, so exciting.
 But besides that, there will be a lot of other activities happening in the area.
 It will be hanging in the tent.
 It will be the heroes.
 The hero city will be running around.
 Then download the app, simply.
 So you don't miss anything.
 And that was the launch party yesterday.
 And tonight the party continues in the 72 Company tent, as you can see.
 Nice flags to buy.
 So be careful and take a turn into the 72 Company tent tonight.
 Yes, and right next to the 72 Company tent there are a lot of other things.
 So you can take a turn past the Bible school or mission,
 and you will get answers to some questions and also just some information on how everything works, simply.
 Yes, and then it's just to say that.
 Thank you for us.
 Thank you.
 From the lively and colorful area of Dappa,
 a young boy named Kunal lives in a narrow neighborhood.
 He shares a small single room house with his father, mother and sister.
 Despite the fact that the home is simple and quiet,
 it is filled with warmth, love and dreams about a better future.
 Every morning, before the father leaves for work as a driver,
 the family eats a simple breakfast together.
 We are poor people, and live in Kolkata.
 I work as a driver.
 I don't earn much, but we manage on what I earn.
 In Dappa, the water runs only for two hours every morning and evening.
 During these times, Kunal's mother goes to the common water source
 to get enough water to cook, clean and wash herself.
 Kunal goes to school.
 He usually has a lot of stomach problems, but not anymore.
 He doesn't just get an education,
 he also learns how to wash himself and maintain a good hygiene.
 Thanks to sponsorship through Indian Children,
 Kunal gets the opportunity to go to a committed and safe school.
 There he doesn't just get an education,
 he also gets an enterprising meal, access to lessons on health care,
 as well as support from considerate and committed teachers.
 The teachers are very kind and take good care of the children at school.
 They get pens, pens and books.
 The school gives them everything.
 They teach the children to speak and behave well.
 Kunal has also learned so much.
 Through the care he has received at school, Kunal has also been freed
 from the stomach problems that previously troubled him.
 He takes home much of what Kunal learns at school.
 He tells his family about everything he has learned.
 Being a father-child doesn't just affect Kunal.
 It affects the whole family and further out in the neighborhood.
 And contributes to a brighter future.
 What will you be when you grow up?
 A soldier?
 Be a father today. Change a life forever.
 The European Conference
 Hello, the European Conference!
 So nice to see you!
 My name is Rediette and I have the privilege of being part of the team at Indian Children.
 I would like to wish, if it's okay with you,
 that we start with a really big and warm applause to all the donors we have.
 Can we do that together?
 Big, big thanks!
 The applause is to you, as I know,
 has supported the work for many years by asking for, giving and investing
 into the future of children in India.
 And it's not just school that you can do,
 but we help children to be lifted out of misery.
 As we saw in the intro, you can live easily.
 There are many parts of the world where you live easily.
 But no human, in particular children, will have to live in misery.
 No, it's not God's idea.
 But through work we make this possible.
 And also parents and children are so incredibly grateful.
 So your support means a lot.
 For those who don't know what Indian Children is,
 the work was founded in 1998
 and is part of the Humanitarian Work Conference in India.
 And I remember so clearly when I was sent out of here and lived in Calcutta,
 I remember this girl in the slum.
 I met a girl who was standing in the middle of the trash.
 It wasn't pretty around her.
 She had a dress that was

 Artus book sisters as listed last night as a gift and thanks
 Every contribution is as big as a small difference
 Thank you for listening and thank you for being with and giving in to give the children of India
 A brighter future God bless you
 During one prayer meeting we had this encounter where God was speaking to several of us
 Don't forget about Macedonia and it was very strong and we felt like we need to act on it
 So the last year we have been coming to Macedonia to connect with people, connect with churches
 To see where is God leading us in this area of missions right now
 Because we have a word from God to go here and we just go on that word
 Over the last three years we have focused on sending mission teams and missionaries to the Balkans
 Through meetings, conferences and programs doors opened, connections were made with local churches
 And in the last two years missionaries have been living in Macedonia
 Building relationships and sharing the gospel
 Now they are reaching even further into Kosovo a country where the gospel faces great challenges
 In Kosovo for now is about one million and a half people
 And we have only 24 churches in Kosovo
 And most of them are small, 10 people, 15
 And as the church we decided now to start to plan new churches
 And we started in two cities new churches to plan
 Not because we have big number in our church but because we have the big heart to share the gospel
 So the group of Macedonia that come from Word of Life they are a big blessing for us
 They have been such a blessing for Kosovo
 They have been someone that helped us and they also evangelize
 And we have a lot of new believers in our church because of them
 I believe that God has a big plan for Kosovo and he wants to work through the Kosovo
 But sometimes we need the support from the mission for Word of Life organization
 To send a mission out or short time or long term
 And to help us together to spread the gospel to the people, to Islamic and to plant in new churches
 We really need missionaries so that one day we can celebrate the blessings together
 And we can baptize people together
 I am very thankful for what Word of Life is doing
 That they are trusting people, they are equipping people through the Bible school
 And sending people and giving this big trust to care for this contact
 To care for these pastors, these people who Jesus so dearly care about
 And seeing that we can handle that trust is something very beautiful actually
 It all started with a team, with a small voice from the Holy Spirit
 Don't forget Macedonia
 And now we see a new wave of missions flowing through the Balkans
 Will you be a part of it?
 And we are praying every day that Word of Life will continue to support us
 And will give us new teams just to help us share the gospel
 Because it's not always good to feel alone there
 And when we have people from outside helping us it's such a blessing
 Because then we feel like God has answered our prayers
 Jesus is a really big applause for these wonderful heroes
 A real applause
 A real Word of Life
 You know I get so moved almost to tears when I think that we still have to pray
 And that we have to pray for the Lord Jesus Christ
 And that we have to pray for the Lord Jesus Christ
 You know I get so moved almost to tears when I think that we still have to be part of the mission
 Some of us philosophize but we mission
 And there is a big difference
 We said yesterday at home in Amorka when we talked about this
 Imagine that we hear new calls
 Macedonian, do you remember the Macedonian call in the Bible?
 That Paul, are you happy that he went?
 He could have stayed in Mycenae
 Mycenae
 Friday the chips
 But he chose to go immediately into Europe
 Thanks to that call that came
 Paul went to Lyria, it's in Albania
 So Paul, these are the lands that have been in the hands of the Lord
 But it's time to return to the hands of the Lord
 And we got a word from God
 If the Gospel doesn't break in on the Balkans, then Islam will break in on the Balkans
 And I think that God doesn't want the Balkans to be Islamized
 It should be Christianized
 Amen
 It should be a country where new gatherings, new churches
 And I get so moved when I hear Kosovo
 I remember when the war was on the Balkans and how horrible it was
 I've seen it in the years
 But when we come to these countries and see how those who fight
 They are in the same gathering, they have met Jesus together
 And they want to evangelize and win the world together
 And now we hear the call, come here, send a team
 Come from Uppsala, come from Sweden, come from the north
 And help us take these countries for God
 I think we should see a wake in Kosovo
 Kosovo should not produce more ISIS soldiers
 But should produce Jesus people
 And we give a big team
 When we came to the 2000s, 2000 years ago
 To Europe, to Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia
 When we came to you, you were there
 Then we heard the call, now Peter and his wife are here
 And pastors in Bratislava, and others here too
 And God has a work
 But it started with a call
 We hear the call, we can not let the call be silenced
 But we should go
 Tonight, as you understand, we will take up the collection
 To reach the Balkans with the evangelism
 That our missionaries in Macedonia can go into Kosovo
 And we will send out several teams
 I think we will send out many, many, many, many wonderful teams
 Into these countries
 Can we agree on that?
 So now we will take up the collection for tonight
 You can give in many ways
 You can give via Swish
 We do not have a Blish yet, but we have Swish
 Vips in Norwegian
 We do not have a Finnish
 Chips, I usually say, but I do not know if there is
 But there are many ways
 If you have a card, you can go to the card terminal
 You can give there
 If you want to give cash, there are collect boxes
 Down by the door when you go out from here
 You can always be there
 If you want to give your card via the network
 You can give a value card as well
 You can always be there to give a gift
 To this fantastic thing
 And I think you understand that
 This sacrifice tonight is
 This is the first sacrifice in the history of the Living Word
 We take to Kosovo
 Imagine, say it first
 This is the first sacrifice we give to Kosovo
 It is the only sacrifice in the history of the Living Word
 For Kosovo
 We have given to Russia, we have given to Ukraine
 We have given to Armenia and to Azerbaijan
 We have never given anything to Kosovo
 There are 24 gatherings
 And 1.5 million people
 Imagine, 24 gatherings
 We have more gatherings in Uppsala
 Than in all of Kosovo
 And that is not right
 We should be there to start
 New gatherings, new works of God
 So you can be there to give a gift
 Should we ask for the collect this evening
 And then we should just give this sacrifice
 In the hands of the Lord
 Father, we thank you for being with us
 And to sacrifice tonight for Kosovo
 Thank you for being with us
 And to see that new workers
 Should be able to go out to these countries
 To Macedonia
 And these places that once heard a cry
 Come over and help us
 Now we hear these Macedonian cries again
 Come over and help us
 Come over and let us be with you
 Come here and help us bring in the harvest
 Here is where we want to go
 We want to be with you and send these teams
 Tonight, when we bring up our gifts
 It is possible to help
 The team to go into Kosovo
 We ask for this
 And we thank you for it
 In the name of Jesus Christ
 Amen
 Say to your neighbors, it is wonderful to give
 Amen
 We can give you a gift
 For this fantastic work
 We are waiting, amen
 Amen

 Wonderful to be praised by God in the Rope of Conference
 Amen
 Now we are going to do something else wonderful
 We can just go from the promise and the offer
 And straight into God's word
 Right?
 Do you know that in this place we believe that God's word is alive and effective?
 Does anyone believe that?
 God's word is alive and effective
 And that is why we are so happy that we have Vande Corano here today
 With her husband John, it is wonderful that they are here
 We feel them as people full of faith, full of God's word
 And they are building a conference, a great, wonderful, life-like conference
 In Central, in the middle of Barcelona
 Isn't it wonderful?
 There are no good football teams there, but there are wonderful conferences
 So they are building International Church of Barcelona
 When I love Barcelona
 So we can't just give Brandy the biggest applause and welcome her here
 Welcome
 Are you doing ok?
 Are you doing ok?
 Say to your neighbor, it is nice to meet you at the Rope of Conference
 Please have a seat
 It is so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
 Exactly
 To be with you tonight
 You are some of my favorite people
 This is one of my favorite countries
 I love your Pastoral team
 Can we thank your Pastors who have worked so hard for this time?
 Praise the Lord
 I also want to take a moment
 To thank every single volunteer who is serving this week
 For this place
 We see some of you
 We don't see a lot of you
 And you are making things possible in the heavenly realms and we thank you
 I am so excited this time
 I am always excited, let's be honest
 But I am extra excited this time
 Because I have my favorite person here with me
 John Carano stand to your feet
 This is my man right here
 Apparently we match perfectly tonight
 That was not our plan
 You will hear from John tomorrow
 He has a word for you tomorrow
 I am so excited to meet my new friend
 What an honor to serve alongside you this week
 John and I just celebrated 21 years married
 That's a long time
 Can I tell you it is better than ever
 Let me introduce you to my family
 We have three beautiful children
 They are my family
 We have three beautiful children
 They are at camp at the same camp this week
 Bella is 16
 She thinks she is in love
 She is not in love
 She thinks she has a boyfriend
 She does not have a boyfriend
 In Jesus name
 Julia is 11 years old
 And our son, our baby is no longer a baby
 Our baby is 8 years old right now
 His name is John John
 And he is amazing
 And I want to tell you this
 We were completely, completely, completely infertile
 We were told we would not have children
 They told us that it is impossible for us to have children
 Do you have a picture of our family to put up?
 Maybe you already did
 When I look at that picture
 I am so encouraged
 Because the greatest gifts of God
 Do not come like you think they will come
 They do not look the way you think they will look
 But our God is faithful
 Our God is trustworthy
 If he says he will do it, he will do it
 I do not know who needs to hear that tonight
 Trust your God
 He knows what he is doing
 He does not love me more than he loves you
 God does the impossible still
 Amen
 This week we are talking about activating our purpose
 I love this so much
 And I like this topic so much
 Because each of us have a God given, God breathed purpose
 We all have a common purpose
 The same call to the disciples
 That is the call to follow
 We are all called to follow
 We are all called to follow Jesus
 Amen
 We are all called to follow Jesus
 But then there is the specific things
 There is the giftings and the talents
 There is the things that I think make God smile when he looks at each of us
 The specific purposes and good works that he has for us
 The scripture says a lot about this purpose
 Ephesians 2
 We are God's handiwork in Christ Jesus
 To do good works that he prepared for us
 Romans 8 says
 We have been called according to his purpose
 So all things are working together for our good
 So all things are working together for our good
 So all things are working together for our good
 Ephesians 1
 Says that we have been chosen, we have been called
 The Psalms, the Proverbs
 They talk constantly about God's plans and his purposes for our lives
 Each of us
 Has a God given, God breathed
 Purpose
 Let's see if I have a marker over here
 I do have a marker over here
 Let's see if I can open this marker
 I'm going to write in English
 But you don't understand
 But you don't understand
 Each one of us
 Each one of us
 Each one of us
 Has a purpose
 The truth is this
 It is God's work to give us that purpose
 It is God's job to call us
 It is God's responsibility to call us
 But it is our job to activate that purpose
 It is our job
 To hear the call
 To listen
 And to obey
 We see this in the life of Paul
 In Colossians chapter 1
 Paul says I have become a servant to the gospel
 Making the gospel known to the Gentiles
 He says I know my purpose
 He says I know why I'm on this planet
 He says I know why I'm on this planet
 I know who I am on this earth
 In verse 28 he says
 He says Christ is the one that I proclaim
 Christ is the one that I proclaim
 I exhort and I teach everyone
 So that we may present everyone mature in Christ
 So that we may present everyone mature in Christ
 He's saying I know my purpose
 My God given purpose is to proclaim and to exhort and to mature
 My God given purpose is to explain and to proclaim and to make Christ known
 And in verse 29 he says about his part
 And in verse 29 he says about his part
 And to this end
 To accomplish that purpose
 I strenuously contend
 So I always fight
 I work, I strive, I give it my all
 According to the energy that Christ works within me
 He's saying I know what God has called me to do
 And I fight for it
 And I struggle for it
 And I go for it with all of my strength and energy
 See until we activate
 Until we fight, until we give ourselves fully to it
 Until we give ourselves fully to it
 Our purpose remains undeveloped
 It remains dormant
 It's just an idea
 It's just a dream
 It's just a possibility
 And that is called potential
 Potential
 I don't know how to write it in Swedish
 But in English that's called potential
 This is our potential
 But I want you to catch this
 That our purpose is only potential
 Until we activate it
 I want to say it again
 Our purpose is only potential
 Until we activate it
 Until we activate it
 We see the other Timotheus
 Paul writes to his spiritual son
 He says Timotheus you're called
 He says Timotheus there is greatness within you
 Timotheus there is greatness within you
 I saw it in your grandmother
 It is in you
 He calls out the purpose in Timotheus life
 He calls out the purpose in Timotheus life
 But catch verse 6 of chapter 1
 He says for this reason
 He says for this reason
 He says I remind you
 To fan and to flame the gift of God
 Another version says to stir up the gift of God
 He says I see it in you
 He says I see it in you
 But we're not talking about your potential here
 We're going for some purpose here
 And in order to reach that purpose
 Timotheus you have to stir it up
 You have to fan it and to flame it
 I can't do it for you Timotheus
 You have to do it for yourself
 I see it
 But we want to go beyond potential to our full purpose
 So purpose is only potential
 Until it is stirred up
 Until it is fanned and to flame
 Until it is fought for and worked for
 I love being a pastor
 I love sharing God's word
 I love sharing God's word
 And almost every week in the church or at a conference
 You say oh Brandy
 That word was for me
 It was exactly what I wanted to hear
 And God knew I needed to hear it
 And I say praise God
 I will say it to you this week
 I will say it to you after this message tonight
 Praise the Lord
 Thank you for sharing
 Now what are you going to do about it?
 What are you going to do about it?
 I am so tired of good intentions
 What breaks the heart of a pastor
 And what must break the heart of our God
 Is when he speaks
 We're impacted
 And he puts something down in us
 We're inspired
 But we change absolutely nothing
 That is called potential
 That's not what we're going for this week
 We're going for the full purpose of God
 We're going for everything that God has for us
 We want everything that God has for us
 But if we stay in our potential and our good intentions
 If we just stay with our good intentions
 Then we will never get into the full purpose of our life
 I hear it all the time
 I hear it all the time Brandy
 I want a good marriage
 But I'm going to keep acting selfishly
 I hear it all the time
 I want strong relationships in my life
 But I've been hurt so I'm going to avoid people at all costs
 I want to be a great mom, a great dad
 But I'm going to work a little bit longer
 And I'm going to get home so tired
 But I only want to play games on my phone
 Instead of talking to those who I say I love the most
 I'm not being hard on you
 I'm being hard on me
 Because all of us have good intentions
 But we need to be working towards transformation in Jesus name
 Amen? Amen? Come on!
 You know what I'm talking about
 People who say I want to be close to God
 But I haven't read my Bible in weeks or months
 But I haven't read my Bible in weeks or months
 But I haven't read my Bible in weeks or months
 I want to be vibrant with Jesus
 But I'm not going to pray in the Spirit
 I want to do big things for God
 But I'm not going to obey the small things He asks me to do
 I want to write that book
 I want to start that ministry
 I want to go on that mission
 I want to go on that mission
 But I'm going to think about it a little longer
 I'm going to wait until I see the full picture
 I need more clarity
 I need more time
 I need more experience
 This week is about moving past our intentions and potential
 During up the gift of God
 And to live God's gift
 To blow life into what God has called you
 And to move straight towards our God
 Amen? Amen?
 I'm glad you're clapping
 But I'm telling you if you ask me later and say that was so good Brandy
 But if you say to me later that was so good Brandy
 I'm going to say then what are your next steps
 I'm going to say what is God speaking to you
 I'm going to ask you what is God speaking to you
 Because that's where the magic happens
 When we stop talking about it and do it
 When we stop dreaming about it and walk towards it
 When we stop dreaming about it and start walking towards it
 Am I being too hard on you?
 Am I being too hard on you?
 Are we okay?
 Do you still like me a little bit?
 How do we do it?
 That's the big question Brandy how do we do it?
 That's the big question how do we do it?
 How do we do it?
 There is a path
 From our potential to our purpose
 That goes from our potential to our purpose
 There is a very specific path that we are on
 There is a very specific path that we can walk on
 I'm on a path where you at?
 I'm on your path
 We are on a path and we are walking towards our purpose
 We are on a path and we are walking towards our purpose
 Can we thank Eva Moberg she's amazing
 She's the best
 She's the best
 She's the best
 All of us are on this path somewhere
 We are all on a path and a path somewhere
 The bible talks a lot about the path
 And the bible talks a lot about the path
 His word lights up our path
 His path lights up our path
 He will make our path straight
 If we submit to him he will make our path firm
 If we let ourselves be to him he will make our path firm
 I love Proverbs 4
 I love the original book 4
 It says give careful thought to the path of your feet
 Watch your feet carefully
 It's an encouragement and a warning
 It's both an encouragement and a warning
 Give careful thought to the path of your feet
 Be careful with where you put your feet
 So here's my question for you right now
 So here is my question for you
 Am I yours?
 I'm yours
 It's the path you're on, right now
 Leading you to your purpose
 It leads you to your purpose
 It's the path that you are on right now
 And the direction you are walking to right now
 The direction that you are living in right now
 The decisions you are making right now
 And the decisions in your mind right now
 your potential toward your purpose.
 I want to ask you to struggle with that question this week.
 Put that question before the Holy Spirit.
 Say, search me and know me, God.
 Examine my innermost being.
 Lead me on the way everlasting.
 Because I want everything that you have for me.
 I don't want anything that you have for me to not be done.
 That's my question.
 Is the path you're on right now,
 leading you from your potential to your purpose?
 The problem is that the path is not always smooth.
 The path can be very narrow.
 The path can be full of obstacles.
 It can't be, it is full of obstacles.
 Constantly there are obstacles on the way.
 The roadblocks on our way on this path are literally endless.
 To try and stop us.
 To try and hold us back.
 To try and keep us stuck.
 I want to share three of those obstacles tonight.
 I could share 20,000 obstacles tonight.
 But we're going to go with three.
 And these are the three that appear on my path most often.
 Here goes the first one.
 There we go.
 Doubt.
 Doubt.
 I have struggled with doubt my entire life.
 I was always a curious child.
 Always asking questions.
 I still do.
 I still who I am.
 My sister would talk to Jesus like she knew him.
 I was so jealous.
 My bravest prayer was God if you can hear me.
 God if you are out there.
 That was my bravest prayer.
 I was raised in South America.
 My parents were missionaries.
 I went to Christian University.
 I met a man of God named John Carano.
 We went straight into full time ministry.
 Everywhere we went we were leading something.
 We didn't have a clue.
 We still don't have a clue.
 We don't know where we went.
 I was leading a bible study.
 I was preaching a message.
 I was mentoring a new believer.
 But my little secret was the doubt and unbelief.
 That I was battling in my mind constantly.
 Constantly.
 Every few years I would have a faith crisis.
 After a few years I got a faith crisis.
 But I could pull myself out of it.
 I could get back on track.
 And then we moved to Europe.
 Nothing had prepared me for the dark continent.
 I loved the language.
 I loved the food.
 Everything was great on the outside.
 But on the inside.
 There was a battle raging in my mind that shocked me.
 There was a battle in my spirit that terrified me.
 I couldn't feel darkness.
 I couldn't see light.
 There was nothing.
 I felt nothing.
 I saw nothing.
 I spiraled into a pit that I could not get myself out of.
 I'll never forget the night when it all hit the fan.
 John and I were watching television.
 I turned off the TV.
 And I said, John, I'm a fake.
 I'm a fraud.
 I am not the woman of God you think I am.
 I am not the teammate in ministry you think I am.
 And I'm not the teammate in ministry you think you have.
 And I'm so sorry.
 Because you don't deserve this.
 But I cannot do this anymore.
 I'm a fake.
 I cried so hard that night.
 I was so devastated that night.
 Because I knew it was over.
 Not our marriage.
 Because he loves me entirely too much.
 But I was convinced that our call and our mission was over.
 And it was my fault.
 I couldn't handle it.
 I wasn't strong enough.
 He would have to leave his call because of me.
 I finally stopped crying.
 And I said, I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 And I finally stopped crying.
 And he said, Bran, it's okay.
 I said, Bran, it's okay.
 I was furious.
 Are you listening to me?
 This is not okay.
 There is nothing okay about this.
 He said, Brandy, you don't know who you are right now.
 But I know who you are.
 You are loved.
 You are called.
 And you will get through this.
 And God is great enough.
 For your doubts and your questions.
 Thank you for the applause.
 But that's not how I felt.
 I said, thanks, Jon.
 I just wish God would tell me that.
 Jon shrugged his shoulders.
 He said, I think God just did tell you that.
 I was like, you're right.
 Jon was right.
 Nothing magical happened that night.
 But God was calling me back to himself.
 But God called me back to himself that night.
 I couldn't feel anything.
 But I believed he was listening.
 I didn't feel, I wasn't experiencing anything.
 But I took a step that night.
 A step of faith.
 Back towards my God.
 My prayers were short.
 But they were from my heart.
 I took a few scriptures out of the Bible.
 I held onto them for dear life.
 And here's what I have come to learn.
 Faith is a choice.
 I want you to grab that.
 This is not for everyone, but this is for someone.
 Faith is a choice.
 It is a decision of will.
 It is a decision of will.
 It is not a feeling.
 It is a decision that you have to make and I have to make.
 To walk by my own understanding.
 To walk by my own vision.
 To walk with my own logic.
 Or to walk by faith.
 You know Hebrews 11.
 It says faith.
 It says confidence of what we hope for.
 It's being sure of what we do not see.
 So by definition.
 The minute you can see it.
 That is no longer faith.
 That is sight.
 That is what is visible.
 And we are not called to walk by sight.
 We are called to walk by faith.
 I want to encourage you tonight.
 Some of you are waiting for a magical moment when you know everything.
 What move to make?
 What step to make?
 And God is saying to you.
 And God is saying to you.
 Just keep walking.
 When you see it.
 You don't have to feel it.
 When you don't see anything.
 And you don't feel anything.
 You walk in faith.
 What doubts are on your path today?
 About yourself?
 About your call?
 About God?
 What is the step of faith that he is asking you to take?
 What steps of faith do I take to get rid of your doubts?
 It's a pretty big obstacle.
 It's just me who is struggling with that obstacle.
 You are actually called the word of faith.
 But some people think that your faith is not enough.
 And that's a lie from the pit of hell.
 Don't fall for it.
 It's not true.
 You understand it.
 The second obstacle that comes our way.
 What distracts.
 No one wants to talk about it.
 No one wants to admit to it.
 We are so sinking distracted.
 We are so easily distracted.
 Friends, this world is not whispering to us.
 This world is not whispering to our children.
 This world is screaming at us.
 It is screaming at our children.
 I am shocked by the amount of distraction that we allow in our lives.
 This world wants our time, our energy.
 Our focus, our emotions.
 I hear it all the time.
 Brandy, I just don't have time.
 I don't have time to spend with God.
 I don't have time to work on my health.
 I don't have time to spend with my children.
 I don't have time for the secret place.
 I don't have time to mentor that person.
 I don't have time to mentor that person.
 I don't have time to serve in my church.
 You fill in the blank.
 I just don't have time.
 Excuse my bluntness tonight.
 That's not true.
 It's not true.
 You have time and I have time.
 You have time and I have time.
 For everything that I say is important to me.
 You have time and I have time.
 For everything that I say is important to me.
 The question is will we make the time?
 It is time that the children of God
 exercise the spiritual fruit
 called self-control.
 It's the fruit that we don't want to talk about.
 It's the fruit that I think is the worst.
 It's patience and patience of course.
 It's the two that are quite difficult for us.
 I love love and gentleness.
 It's time that we exercise self-control.
 We need to exercise self-control
 and take back the time that we have to spend.
 So our potential can move towards the opposite.
 We can't be so distracted.
 A few years ago I was at Zara Kids
 and I was there shopping clothes.
 My son was sitting in a children's bath.
 And two men came on each side.
 And the man said, excuse me,
 could you give me these pants?
 So I took the pants and gave it to the man.
 And he said, thank you.
 And he left.
 Two minutes later
 I feel in the pocket after my phone
 and it was gone.
 Those men had targeted me.
 Those men had distracted me with pants.
 And those men had stolen from me.
 I submit to you tonight
 that when you are distracted
 you are being robbed.
 When you are distracted
 you are being robbed.
 It happened right under my very eyes.
 I was right there with my baby son.
 And I was being stolen from because I was distracted.
 You know John 10 10
 The thief has come to steal
 to kill, to destroy
 You are being targeted
 It says in 1 Peter chapter 5
 Be sober and alert
 because your enemy is going around like a lion
 seeking whom to devour
 The enemy of your soul
 is not playing cute little games with your life
 He is not playing cute little sweet games
 with your children
 He is not playing games with your call
 and your purpose and your future
 He is playing for keeps
 He is trying to steal, to kill and to destroy
 He is trying to steal, to kill and to destroy
 And we are so distracted by all of this
 When He steals our joy
 When He steals our peace
 When He steals our sound mind
 We have never needed a sound mind like right now
 We are just handing over our valuable resource
 Which will always be our time
 And then we don't have time
 And we say I just can't do it
 Time in God's word in His house with those we say we love
 I want you to catch this
 The fulfillment of your God given purpose
 will be determined
 by your ability
 to resist and limit distraction
 Let's say that again
 The fulfillment of your God given purpose
 will be largely determined
 by our ability to limit and resist distraction
 How can we hear His will if we are not in the secret place
 How can we obey His voice
 If we are not spending time listening to His voice
 How can we raise up the next generation
 if we are not spending time with the next generation
 How can our purpose ever be accomplished
 if we are so distracted
 I believe the Holy Spirit has been speaking to many of you
 About specific distractions
 that you need to limit or lay down
 You know what it is
 Maybe it's your social media
 Maybe it's your portfolio
 Maybe it's that little game that keeps you up at night
 I don't know what it is for you
 Maybe it's your phone
 I love my phone and I hate my phone
 Am I the only one
 I'm telling you the Holy Spirit is speaking
 And if we're going to move from potential to purpose
 There will be specific distractions
 That we are responsible for limiting or limiting distraction
 It keeps showing up in my path
 It keeps showing up in my path
 What is it for you
 Maybe write it down in your notes
 Take a moment to ask the Holy Spirit
 Because we've got one more big obstacle to talk about
 And here's what we'll close tonight
 And here's what we'll close tonight
 Doubts
 Distractions
 Distraction
 And this one is extra, extra, extra dangerous
 It shows up continuously on my path
 It shows up continuously on my path
 It's the obstacle of discouragement
 And it's the obstacle of discouragement
 The band can come back whenever they're ready
 They can come back and say
 I feel like I'm going to die
 I feel like I'm going to die
 I feel like I'm going to die
 I feel like I'm going to die
 They can come back up the band
 You have lived long enough to know
 That the awesome and the awful are always there
 You have lived long enough to know
 That the pain and the pleasure are always there
 You have lived long enough to know
 That laughter and tears are always there
 That laughter and tears are always there
 All the time
 We keep waiting for life to get easier
 We wait all the time for life to get easier
 And sometimes it does
 Sometimes it does
 But there will always be real and discouraging circumstances on our path
 But there will always be real and discouraging circumstances on our path
 Here's the truth tonight
 Disgust can either paralyze us
 Disgust can either paralyze us
 Or it can push us forward
 When we hit discouragement
 When we hit discouragement
 It's when we either choose to step back
 Or we choose to keep moving forward
 This is the most dangerous in my experience
 Obstacle on our path
 Because it makes your heart sick
 It breaks something within you
 It causes you to be sad and downcast
 It causes you to be sad and downcast
 It causes you to not see the future clearly
 It causes uncertainty and fear
 When we arrived in Spain 15 years ago
 We were greeted by other missionaries
 They said welcome to Spain
 We said thank you, we're so happy to be here
 They said you're going to love it
 But just keep this in mind
 Don't get your hopes up
 Welcome to Spain
 Don't get your hopes up
 We did not move across the ocean
 With our then 10 month old baby
 To do what we can do
 We came to do and see what only God can do
 But our first introduction
 Was don't get your hopes up
 We started pastoring the international church 11 years ago
 There were four small groups
 We were told that's all we can have
 Because we don't have our own space
 That's true
 We still don't have our own space
 They were discouraged, they were downtrodden
 But that discouragement of not having our own space
 Has literally pushed us
 Into 65 groups all over the world
 That we now have 65 groups in 14 different languages
 There are two ways to see it
 We don't have space
 Now we can find new spaces
 It can paralyze you or it can propel you forward
 We have groups in coffee shops and parks and living rooms
 A girl got saved in a coffee shop three weeks ago
 Come on
 The Lord knows how to push us forward
 The church started to grow
 And a guy on our team
 Said John Brandy
 Es que hombre es que
 He said we're growing too fast
 So I'm thinking about it
 Maybe we can just plateau for a little while
 And you should have seen my husband's face
 He gets the strong jaw
 His nostrils start to flare
 And I thought if John speaks this will not be good
 I said thank you so much for your words
 In a nation where 99% do not know Jesus
 We refuse to plateau
 We always make room for one more
 It's who we are
 What he was trying to use as discouragement
 Has launched us forward
 We went from one service to two services
 From two to three services
 We now gather in seven services in multiple languages
 We now have seven meetings in different languages
 All glory to God
 All glory to God
 Our circumstances can hold us back
 Or you can go forward
 The Lord has allowed us to open two ministry centers
 Distributing food and clothes to those in need
 Three women off the street came to a gathering and got saved a few weeks ago
 Off the street
 We now have full service coffee shop Monday through Friday
 We've launched a ministry center for people to be shot out
 A school of ministry to minister all over Europe
 Don't you tell me not to get my office in Europe
 You don't tell me not to have hopes
 Our hopes go straight through the roof
 Our hope is not in ourselves, but in Him
 There are some of you who have connected
 With the lie that your best days are behind you
 It's not Jesus' word
 When I prayed for our moment together
 I felt that we specifically had to pray for those of you who are
 With contempt in your life
 Christ has begun a good deed in you
 He will carry it to completion
 You have heard it so many times
 Pretend it's the first time
 He will carry it to completion
 He's going to do it
 He will give you safe passage
 I felt compelled to tell you
 The words of Hebrews 10, verse 39
 That you are not of those who shrink back
 You are of those who have faith and are safe
 I'm going to say it again
 You are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed
 You are of those who have faith and are safe
 Maybe your discouragement is small
 It's just daily things
 And life feels heavy right now
 Or maybe it's big
 Maybe it's been a diagnosis in your family
 Maybe it's been a diagnosis in your life
 Maybe you cannot see the future right now
 Maybe you literally believe I thought I knew and I missed it
 That is not the word of the Lord to you today
 I say it and I prophesy over you
 You are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed
 You are of those who have faith and are safe
 Keep walking
 Keep walking
 Until your ultimate purpose is completed
 When we see him face to face
 And everything we've sung about
 And everything we've believed in
 And everything we prayed for
 When we no longer are our faith
 One day we will stand before the throne
 And we will say worthy worthy worthy worthy
 One day our final purpose will be achieved
 But that day is not yet
 Until that day
 In Jesus name
 You keep walking
 In the power of the Holy Spirit
 Stand where you are tonight
 Father we come before you right now
 We recognize that we struggle
 And we recognize that there are doubts in our lives
 That we don't speak about
 And there are things that disturb us in our daily lives
 And we see that the evil tries to take us away from your path
 And it comes straight from hell
 We thank you for your word
 You have started it and you will complete it
 Help us not to fall back
 Help us to move forward in faith
 If we have doubts
 Or those that distract us and disturb us so much
 And come holy with a flood over us
 There are many of you here
 Who can identify you with these things
 There are others who have other things
 But I want to respond tonight
 That we say I don't want any obstacles
 Whether it is these or anything else
 That it will keep me back from what God has for me
 Until I see Jesus face to face
 If you are struggling with doubts tonight
 I invite you to come down
 There is no shame
 I literally preach about doubt in my own life
 Come on
 There are many of you who have things that distract you so much
 And you just want to put it down
 And there are those of you who are so brave
 Whether it is big or small
 We want to encourage each other
 And our prayer team is here
 And I ask you to respond
 And the people of God will pray and believe together with you in Jesus name
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen
 Amen

 Here is our part of the church
 Here is the intensive prayer
 The prayer
 People meet God
 Many people call to God
 For help in their situation
 Maybe you have done the same
 Where you sit and watch
 We pray for you
 We are with you
 And the desire is that we together meet an upstanding
 Just as you have said PO
 If you have a prayer
 You can send it via email
 To bon
 bon
 snabela
 bonsnabela.se
 bonsnabela.se
 Then your prayer will come with
 In the intensive prayer
 We have been in the choir
 During the whole conference
 The prayer team gathered
 And called to God for the different prayer items
 And there is one pulse
 That is very special
 Can I say
 Just as we have talked about before
 I have been to many conferences
 But just as the word of life
 Carries
 What we talked with Christian about
 At the beginning of this broadcast
 The DNA
 The food
 In some way it came to expression
 In a very wonderful way
 In every meeting
 I walked through the premises
 I went in
 Book club
 And there is a lot
 Of old treasure
 I found one of these
 Small pamphlets
 That you wave out
 Just to quote God's word
 I remember when I read it the first time
 Exactly, and it was really just an expression
 For letting God's word
 Kill us in our lives
 And let that be what it is
 That in some way gives us
 Both guidance and spiritual food for the day
 And that is realities that
 Live on, isn't it?
 So it is, God's word is eternal
 And we can relate to it
 In every time we choose
 If we want to relate more concretely to it
 Or we want it at a distance
 But the more of God's word we can get it better
 That is what we want to talk about
 This little studio session
 Because we have Sofia here
 Sofia Holm, welcome
 Thank you, thank you
 It is great to have you here
 I explained to Anders a little bit
 Who you are, I have actually known you
 All your life
 You have not worked on the word of life all your life
 But now you do
 And work not least with
 Bible schools in broad daylight
 And with mission
 That is right
 And we are going to talk a little bit
 About this with the Bible schools
 Because that is the word of life
 If I am not mistaken
 The Bible school started
 Just before the meeting
 Yes, it is
 When the meeting
 Started already in May
 And then in August
 The Bible school started
 The Bible school was planned before the meeting started
 But the start was just there
 In 1983
 So that is a few years ago
 Yes, it is a while ago
 And there have been a number of students
 Do you have any kind of knowledge of this?
 I know that it was me and my wife
 It was 1987-1988
 I want to remember that we were
 450 students here
 In the Bible school class
 It was year class 1, year class 2 and international
 Yes, we had something
 Where there were 1000 students
 So there have been an incredible number
 My parents actually went to school in 1983
 When it started
 I am almost sure
 That I have been there from the beginning
 But I was not really born then
 Yes, we know
 For a certain part
 We know what we have seen
 From Uppsala, the Bible school
 On site here
 Now we count on over 10,700
 Individuals
 That have been one or two years
 Through our time here in Uppsala
 Which is absolutely amazing
 Yes, it is highly respectable
 Because
 If I think about
 That year, what it meant for us
 It put us on the track
 On the track
 We live, I usually say that
 When I talk about the Bible school
 We still live to a high degree
 From what we, God
 Put down our lives that year
 Yes, really
 And I really like what you are sharing here
 This little faith help brochure
 That has been something
 That I have been very concerned about
 I have often written my own
 Faithful experiences in the same way
 How I feel it in the form of
 God's word
 It was at the Bible school
 That I learned to see and understand
 What this really can do
 With one's life, how it can affect me
 And in the darkness that also
 Affected the people I meet around me
 God's word is alive and real
 We don't come from that
 And we are incredibly grateful for that
 If you just look at this with
 The Bible school
 I have been in some way
 One of the DNA here
 To equip God's people
 With the word of faith
 And this, that God's word
 Can in some way
 Become more than just
 A keepsake, it becomes a part of my life
 How would you say
 Because I have been connected
 To the
 Confucius
 How does this live on today?
 I would say that this is like
 A smear or something
 Over our congregation
 And it has just been
 Moving forward in step by step
 And this has been very important
 For us as well
 In the way we are a congregation
 We work with training
 New people who can confess
 Who can teach, who can preach
 And understand what it means
 That God's word can become
 Alive for those you talk to
 So we see many
 We have teachers in this situation
 Who are both 50
 And 60 and 70 plus
 But we also have young teachers
 Who are in their 20s
 The later 20s
 And I myself am 36
 And I keep thinking about it
 Who actively enter
 And still carry
 The same spirit
 The same word of faith
 Because it is
 What this congregation is
 Over the congregation
 We have to say something
 Because this is not the only
 Bible school that the Word of Life is
 Involved in
 We heard tonight
 About the plans for a Bible school in
 Macedonia
 Which feels very biblical
 And wonderful in all ways
 Anything about the international
 Bible schools or what we now want to call
 Those who are not here
 Yes, and this has followed us
 And this is what I think a little
 With Smörgelsen and the call we have
 The vision that the congregation is based on
 And equip the word of faith
 It has followed us from the beginning
 And when we have come to new places
 New countries, it is
 A lot through Bible schools
 That we have
 Reach to new people
 That we have come to new places
 And that has really been lifted
 And carried in such a strong way
 And we see it now
 That when we start
 Bible schools in places
 Then there is a stability
 On different places where we are
 I have seen it a lot personally
 But if you just take
 The practical and the statistics
 There are also Bible schools that
 We have started or
 Directly initiated
 Here we have over 37,000
 Students who have gone through
 Through the years
 Which is like
 A big place to see and understand
 And then we know that there are many
 Who have gone to our Bible schools
 And then moved home and started their own
 Bible schools or classes
 And we don't even know that
 But it is so much that it has spread
 I myself remember
 Now this is not a regular
 Bible school, we also have something
 That we call Bible training course
 A little shorter course
 To give a preview of what
 Bible means in Bible school, what it is
 I went to India myself
 Together with my dad, it's a few years back
 Then we went to a meeting
 That has existed for a while
 And we came there and would be there
 Two weeks and have evening classes
 Every night of the week
 And from the first evening
 They sang some songs, a little nice
 And Jesus in the family
 And everything was lovely
 But it was not a life there
 In a way
 And then it went evening after evening
 And we went through the foundations of faith
 And healing and the holy spirit
 And suddenly you start to wonder
 How it comes to life and how people
 Sing praise to God
 And there is a hunger
 And it was a couple of hundred
 About that went
 And I think it was 20
 If I'm not mistaken, who were buried in the holy spirit
 And it was just so powerful to see
 That all we did was teach the word
 And something just happens in people
 And we do that
 We see in so many different places
 All the time
 So now we have both in North Macedonia
 Our thoughts and plans
 But we have in
 Right now
 In India we always
 Bible schools, either in one year
 Or two years, a little depending on where we are
 In that stage
 So I was self-taught in the year
 And then in Europe
 It changes a little
 Last year we had quite a few
 This year we have had in Poland
 And in Czech Republic
 And as I said, the plans now forward
 It grows a little forward
 Where we notice that now there is a thirst here
 And now there is something we can do
 And in Ukraine
 And in Ukraine we have had
 We had four different places
 And online since the year
 Exactly
 And there they really saw
 That there were many who had moved
 The country, who were perhaps the leaders
 And initiators in many meetings
 And they felt how we should be able to carry this
 Then we came in with Bible teaching
 And training in that way
 And then they got new leaders
 Who could carry and take over
 In the stadium they were there
 So it is a great feeling
 With Bible school
 It really is
 You can sit here
 And think about
 If I could
 But it does not work
 I am too old or too young
 I do not have the money
 I can not move
 But what would you say
 If you could tell
 Those who are sitting here
 And listening now
 And maybe when a dream or just get inspired
 In a moment when you tell
 You just get inspired
 Do you have any tips? How does it work?
 You read in the half time
 You read in the half time when you walk here
 So it is on the pre-lunches
 During Monday to Friday
 Now we also put in more practice
 So you can get into the assembly
 Active and help out in some area
 So you can work on the afterlunches
 There is that space
 And we try to help and mediate
 Where we know about the place
 Where you can live and find
 And many find an apartment
 Maybe they live together
 And can get it a little cheaper
 But what I would say
 Is that
 If we would put together
 All the food from all the students
 During these years
 It is absolutely incredible
 What God does when you dare
 Take this step
 And it is so often we hear from students
 I did not have everything in place
 There was a little panic and how would this go
 But I decided that now I go again
 And I am in Lupsal and everything has to be solved
 And thing after thing falls in place
 And they can be here for a year
 And give everything to God
 And see God work in them
 They grow
 And it is cool
 My witness brother
 Our witness brother
 We were a little late with sending in the application
 So the library started
 Somewhere in the end of August
 I can imagine
 On a Monday
 I went to my brother in law
 My brother in law
 We had no place to live
 We had no work
 We had no babysitter
 We had a newborn baby
 But God just helped us
 Everything fell in place
 And that is the constant witness brother
 That you hear from someone who has been to the Bible school
 I met someone
 Many years ago
 The Bible school year
 It was the best year of our lives
 To see God work so concretely
 In our situation
 Should I be honest
 Sometimes I think
 Maybe not
 That we need that
 When everything we can
 And that is safe
 Just disappears
 I can not do what I can
 I am not lazy
 But I can not do it naturally
 And then see God work
 That is what
 So much now carries me
 That I can believe in all situations
 Because I know it will hold
 And I would never know if you do not dare
 To take this step that was a little too much
 It was also what Brandy
 Picked up tonight
 Between the potential and
 The purpose to really see
 There are different obstacles
 But when you walk that way
 There are possibilities
 And then you start walking
 And suddenly God is there
 And then you know what to do
 We all know that
 Now it is like this
 That
 Yes
 Before this broadcast
 When we went in here
 Got a very strong feeling
 We had planned
 For that we would swish
 We would give
 To the media work
 But from what we are
 And have right now
 I feel that we should pray
 Instead
 We should have a moment now
 Where we just pray
 It says in God's word that I will send a hunger
 Not for bread
 But for living God's word
 There are so many forces
 In our society that want
 To erase and break down
 The foundation
 That has been found
 Out of God's word in our country
 When the word of life breaks out
 Of course, as with all movements
 There were child diseases
 That were not good
 It is always like that when something happens
 But there was still a call
 And it was also about
 To restore
 Faith in God's word
 As a living reality
 Something that could transform and change people
 And we need it
 As much today
 Maybe even more
 Faith in
 God's word
 That God says
 In a human life
 In your life, in my life, in our life
 That it can really change us
 It does not happen automatically
 But when people in history
 Have called to him
 To send this longing
 Into our lives
 Then something has happened
 Can not you
 Who believe in the power of the bread
 Just unite you with me and with us
 And ask for
 Once again a Bible
 A God's word
 Over our country
 And that people can be touched again
 And above all that hunger
 Can return in our own lives
 Not just slentrion
 Take a thumb verse or read a little
 By duty
 But that this hunger
 And longing for God's word
 As a life-changing
 tool
 Can give us strength in our lives
 Just to touch us
 Should we ask for that now?
 In the middle of this wonderful song
 In the prayer
 We just call to God
 Should we do that?
 And you are with us
 If you believe that the power of the bread
 Can transform and change
 Jesus we come to you
 See in front of your own face
 Lord we believe that you are the one
 Who is the living word
 You spoke and it became
 Here we ask that you just
 Once again fill our hearts
 With the longing for your own word
 The longing for the word
 Which is not only something for the head
 But something that is for our hearts
 That we can live of
 Live in and live for
 Lord thank you for being here
 Fill us with your hunger
 And your longing
 Here we ask that you send
 A hunger over our whole country
 After your word
 Should become
 Strength and power
 In people's lives
 Come now in Jesus Christ
 We ask
 We thank you for your word
 Is living and it is effective
 And we thank you for the word
 Which has been proclaimed
 The word that has been spoken
 Which is already effective
 We just ask for a renewal
 And that you confirm
 The word through your spirit
 Through letting the sign
 Under the skin
 We also ask here just as Anderson
 That there should be a wake of hunger
 A longing, a thirst
 In the assembly in Sweden
 In those who confess to Jesus
 A longing, a passion
 For the word
 A permission to the word
 And a hunger after
 Just getting part of it
 To live of it
 We ask you to give us today
 Our daily bread
 We thank you Lord
 For your power to do it
 We thank you for times of
 Visiting, of resurrection
 Of life in our country
 Again in Jesus name
 We just ask also
 What we just heard from Brandy
 That there is so much that can try to catch
 Our curiosity and take us away
 From what is actually important
 That the word actually gets to be stemmed from
 And that is what
 If you want in this time
 I just ask God that you really come
 And just do it
 Make a way
 Especially for young people
 To be able to put aside
 What is so easy to take away from you
 And just seek you in the word
 For who you are
 That there should be a time
 And a generation right now
 Who dare to believe that your word is true
 That what you want to do
 In this time is real
 And that there is nothing
 That we would rather do than follow you
 And to walk on your path
 In this time
 Filled with your word
 In Jesus name
 Amen
 Wonderful
 Jesus name
 Thank you for doing this together
 With the meeting of the word of life
 With this conference
 From Christian Media channel 10
 And if we are in a place
 We feel a great sense of joy
 We just see it as the beginning of something new
 Because it comes season after season
 When we have to walk with God
 And do what he has
 Just before a time like this
 Amen
 There we are
 I have changed places with PO
 And it is simply because
 Now it is Elin and PO
 Elin Johansson
 Who take over these studio broadcasts
 I ask Söderöver
 To plan a upcoming project
 We are in many many places
 During this summer
 And it is not really over
 We are preparing for summer
 In Boatfjordens hamn
 It sounds a little
 So it is almost
 It sounds like a archipelago
 It sounds like an archipelago at least
 Summer in Boatfjordens hamn
 We will visit Bua
 Which is on the west coast of Söder
 And we will have four nights
 When we are on
 Elida 4
 Today in Chiquina
 Its ship on deck
 And we will broadcast from there
 So don't miss that
 But PO good luck
 You have a great time
 Thank you very much, it was fun to have you with us
 Andes, have a great time
 On the broadcast
 That's right
