[Transcription: Whsiper Medium - English]

 Good morning, good morning and welcome to the Europe Conference on Saturday.
 Yes, Elin, it has been a full-fledged event.
 It has been a full-fledged event, not to mention last night when we had a round dance here and just praised God.
 You were part of this at home, and it was such a wonderful evening.
 We have to remember who we are in Christ, the authority that has been given to us, and that we can speak to our problems.
 We don't have to wait and hope that God wills us well, but that he wills us well and we can take it.
 We really hope that you were part of the strong presence of God, and we believe that, who was here last night.
 But now it's a new day, there are new opportunities to hear from heaven and meet the living God.
 We are very happy that you are with us. We started this broadcast a little earlier today, and we did so because we have a very exciting guest here in the studio.
 I just want to introduce him with a few words, and then we will chat a little with him.
 We also have Sofia who helps us with the translation here.
 The guest is called Fad Masri, and he has come here from the US.
 So we start by saying welcome here, brother.
 Welcome here.
 Thank you.
 We are very happy that you are here.
 We would just like to ask you to tell us a little bit about who you are and what you are doing.
 I would like to ask you who you are and what you are doing.
 I'm a pastor, I'm originally from Beirut, Lebanon.
 I'm a pastor, and I'm originally from Lebanon.
 And I started a ministry called Crescent Project.
 And I started a ministry called Crescent Project.
 To have building bridges and communication between Christians and Muslims.
 We are very committed to Christ as Christians.
 And Jesus told us to love our neighbor as ourselves.
 So if our neighbor is from Muslim background, Hindu background, maybe Lebanese, it doesn't matter.
 We want to share with them the love of Christ.
 So I've been doing this ministry for almost 33 years.
 Wow.
 So I've been doing this ministry for almost 33 years.
 And it's such a joy to see Christians and Muslims communicate, and Muslims ask more to know about Jesus, our savior.
 It's such a joy to see Christians and Muslims communicate, and Muslims ask more to know about Jesus, our savior.
 We should have had a little bit of a hurry when we started.
 We should have had a book that was translated into Swedish.
 We call it Hope for Muslims.
 It's one of 13 books I've written.
 It describes how Muslims often come as refugees or students or something like that.
 And they come to countries where the majority of them are Christians.
 Much better than if they lived in their old Muslim country.
 Shi'a, Sunni, Druze, Alawites, all these groups are fighting each other.
 And so they're asking questions, does God exist?
 Is Islam the only way?
 What do Christians believe?
 Who is Jesus?
 And sometimes they're asking the questions because they have wrong information.
 A simple thing, every Christmas we celebrate the birth of Christ.
 We believe that it was a miracle, Jesus born of a virgin Mary.
 But most Muslims don't know that we believe in the virgin birth.
 They believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, but he was born under a palm tree.
 They don't know the story of the manger and the shepherds.
 So this is an opportunity for Christians to not only show love, but also to tell them the true story of Christ.
 On that line, could you give us some tips on how we as Christians can reach out to Muslims?
 The first thing we can do is just smile at them and ask them when they came here and how they are.
 Just warm and open to them.
 And the second thing is that Muslims believe in one God, just like us.
 So instead of fighting them, we say, oh you believe in God too.
 The God in the Quran is different than the God in the Bible.
 But the teachers tell them that it's the same God.
 So we start the conversation, if you believe in God, I believe in God, let's talk about him.
 It's easy to build walls, but we want to build bridges.
 The other thing we found out is that God is moving among Muslims.
 So in the last 20 years, more Muslims have become followers of Christ than in the previous 1400 years.
 And the number one reason is that they read the Bible in their own language.
 Number two, they met a practicing believer.
 And the third thing is that God does a miracle or shows them a vision or a dream.
 And they start asking why did I have a dream of Jesus, not Muhammad?
 Or why did the miracle happen when we prayed in the name of Jesus?
 And I think this proves to us that God's miracle is a miracle.
 That God's heart is for all people.
 The background of a person is from sin.
 We all had sin.
 But the will of God is eternal life.
 And that's the beauty, you see someone like my friend Karim who went to atheism.
 And this is so beautiful because we see for example my friend Karim, he came.
 And he came from a war zone and he asked these questions.
 What is the Muslim belief in the last days?
 And then he started asking questions about what did Christians believe in the last days?
 Then he started reading the Bible.
 And he became a believer.
 And he has now led 21 Muslims of his friends to become believers.
 The beautiful thing is that once you talk to one person they can talk to their family and friends.
 Like the book of Acts.
 Like in the book of Acts.
 In my experience we are Swedish.
 We think it is difficult to reach Muslims.
 We are a little afraid because they are different.
 But when you tell us we hear that there is a great openness among Muslims.
 I know that there are many Muslims in Europe.
 I know that's why you are here.
 And I think that this is a great mission for us as Christians in Sweden to reach these people.
 Would you like to comment on that?
 One is let me talk about openness or hard.
 Every culture is hard.
 When you share the gospel with Swedes it's hard.
 Many times they don't want to even talk about God.
 I live in the United States.
 And many Americans think they are God.
 Every field is hard.
 But every field is open.
 Because you are going in the name of Jesus.
 The second thing is Muslims are now because of these wars and tensions.
 It's like the soil is getting soft.
 And we pray that the love of the believers will be like rain on the desert.
 And for the last thing, when you see Muslims in your neighborhood,
 if they were back in their old country,
 if they lived in their homeland,
 they would never meet a Christian.
 Never see a church building.
 Never see a bible.
 So our challenge is to be an ambassador.
 Not to make him Christian.
 That's God's job.
 But my job is to be an ambassador for God.
 The Bible says we are Christian ambassadors.
 And that he has given us the message of reconciliation.
 I have read the Quran in Arabic.
 More than 45 times.
 There are no verses on reconciliation.
 But the Bible is built on reconciling us to God.
 And to one another.
 You like me and love me because I am your brother in Christ.
 Not because we are in the same club.
 It's a different understanding of life.
 So John chapter 1 verse 12.
 The Bible says clearly.
 Everyone can be in the family of Jesus.
 That is our message.
 I am so encouraged by what you share.
 Just looking at you actually.
 I am encouraged to listen to him.
 But it is enough to look into his eyes.
 Because you can see that what he is talking about is something that is real.
 Finally, is there anything else you would like to say to the Christians here in Scandinavia?
 It is true that there are jihadist Muslims.
 Studies say that 5% of every Muslim community is jihadist.
 So the role of the government is to protect the Muslims.
 And to protect the Muslims.
 And to protect the Muslims.
 And to protect the Muslims.
 And to protect the people.
 But there are 95% who are nominal Muslims.
 Who are open to talk about Jesus.
 So we as Christians should focus on them.
 And Scandinavia is a beautiful way because you have beautiful countries.
 You are organized.
 You give them different feelings.
 Let us use this to welcome.
 And share with them the best news that Christ came because he loves us.
 He wants to give us eternal life.
 Let us use this to share with them how God cares about us and wants to give us eternal life.
 If we talk about Jesus with 1 million Muslims in Sweden.
 And if we talk to them about Jesus and the good news.
 And 1% becomes follower of Christ.
 That is 100,000 different countries.
 And they can go back and tell their family.
 And that is what has been happening in the last 30 years in our ministry.
 Because we find out they are so happy to know Jesus.
 Because they are so happy to know Jesus.
 So they call their mother, father, brother, grandparents.
 And that is exactly what we see in the bible.
 If Andreas offers in Nathan and so on.
 And the message goes on.
 We could continue this interview for a long time.
 Thank you so much for coming and sharing.
 The meeting is going on.
 A little update on what is happening today.
 We have the morning meeting that starts here with HEN and Worku.
 Who will preach.
 Then we have a little youth event during the day.
 But at 13.00 David Ekerbrink has a meeting.
 If you are here you can join.
 Then in the afternoon there is a prayer service with Elim and the words of life.
 And it will be broadcast on Tlm Play.
 We broadcast it not linearly on channel 10.
 But on Tlm Play, the old Tibia Nordics website.
 You can go in and see it.
 Also on the words of life YouTube will be broadcast.
 Then we have the evening meeting where David Ekerbrink.
 Who is the new head pastor here on the words of life.
 Will be preaching from the words of God.
 This will be a day to look forward to.
 Really, I feel charged.
 A little tired but even more charged.
 Then I hope that we can all meet together.
 Through the charms here during the day.
 Enjoy now from God's presence and from God's word.
 See you later.
 The last day of the conference.
 We have had a wonderful conference together.
 God's grace has been so strong.
 And I expect that he will meet you right now in the song of promise.
 Hallelujah, we praise you Jesus.
 We love you.
 We love you.
 We love you.
 We love you.

 Hallelujah, hallelujah, thank you Jesus
 We are going to do this now that we have received many
 pious prayer items and have been here during this conference
 we have been taught about this
 to take authority in the name of Jesus
 to ask for the promise of God
 so let us do this together as a Christian body
 now we lift up these people who are in great need of healing
 and healing, so Lord right now we come before your face
 and we pray you Lord, to be one of these precious people
 Lord, we thank you for they are so loved by you Lord
 and we take authority now over all forms of cancer
 all forms of sickness in the name of Jesus
 and we proclaim that through your wounds
 there is healing for them, we just speak out
 health, life and healing in the name of Jesus
 hallelujah, we thank you for right now
 wherever they are, you come and touch them

 we pray you about it, for all these cancer-sick people
 God heal them, come with your healing

 God heal them, set them free Lord
 we thank you for it, and let you be a witness
 for your great love, goodness and grace
 we thank you for it, we give you all of this
 and we praise and offer you in the name of Jesus Christ
 and everyone say amen, wonderful
 I present you to someone who stands beside you, say something encouraging
 and then you are welcome to sit down
 wonderful to hear the sound that goes through the church hall
 Sebastian Asklund is one of the pastors on this place
 and we are so happy for everyone who has come here
 to this conference, even if it has been here all week
 or the first meeting, you can feel so welcome
 and so welcome also you who follow online
 today we have the great joy to listen to Henok Vorko
 who is a pastor in Frankfurt, in Vivchurch
 and he is here for the third time, so it is so
 fun to have him, we have had him at our youth conference
 but now he is also here, we felt that he has so much
 to give, and we want to give to everyone, not just to the youth
 so Henok we are so happy to have you here, shall we give him
 and his family a warm applause
 so let us sit with the expectation of what God will do
 this morning, we have a lovely long day ahead of us
 full of good things, so at 13 o'clock
 for you who are leaders either in the church or
 outside the church in business or in other ways, you are warmly welcome
 to the pastor at 13.00 when pastor David Ekebring
 will speak to us, and then at 15 o'clock we will continue
 to pray honor and praise God here in the church hall
 and we have the Elim Worship who leads us in love songs
 so you have to look forward to that, and of course also the evening meeting
 so there is a lot of good things, and as always, if you have not downloaded the app
 please do so, then you will get good control of everything
 that happens, and there you will also see
 all the nice maps out in the area
 everything that is there, and among other things we have our bookshop
 go out there, go by, and get yourself home
 good education that you can take part of even after
 this conference, I want to especially highlight Priscilla Shire's book
 I now leave everything, and also
 Willem Mennister's book, Time to go out
 very good books, so go out there, and there are many other
 nice offers, so warmly welcome there
 and if you go out there, you will also see the different mantras
 you can get more information about the Bible school, about our mission work
 and also this, which you will see on the screens now
 regardless of what your starting point is when you come to high school
 Anska High School is a place where you can develop
 support for those who need it, and challenges for those who want to see
 how far you can go
 at us you get the opportunity to, apart from your high school exam
 increase your competence with different diplomas, media production
 with the direction of camera operator, as well as social engagement
 with the direction of social responsibility
 and the aesthetic program, you can read special directions
 music and business, or music and social communication
 and get the same
 experience
 Hi, I wonder if there are some here who are about to start high school
 Give me a hand
 Yes, a few, are there some here who have children or relatives who are about to start high school
 Give me a hand
 There are many more
 This is Edvin
 He is two, and soon is a relative term
 Did you long for starting high school?
 I have not really come to terms with how much it works
 My name is Shania Cambruner and I work as a teacher in theatre and economy at the Anska High School
 After ten years in the municipal elementary school, I chose to switch to our high school
 I longed to be in an environment where I could defend my faith, time and again
 instead I could focus on what I was actually there to learn
 Something that struck me when I came here in the second year was that the teachers were incredibly warm
 and really took an extra mile for us students to succeed
 When I started as a teacher a few years later, I realized that this was not a one-time thing
 but the engagement of the teachers is something that really sits on the walls
 There is a culture of really supporting, challenging, being there so that every single student can succeed
 There is a school not so far away from here
 They have higher grades for the students when they arrive, and that is a plus for all their high school programs
 But when it's time for the students, we at Anska High School have the same average grade
 and a higher margin for the national exams
 What does that mean?
 It means that there is such an engagement here that regardless of the starting point,
 regardless of whether you are an A student in all subjects when you are in the ninth grade
 or maybe you have to fight to get your degree from the elementary school
 there are opportunities for you to really succeed, to reach your full potential
 and hopefully activate your purpose during the time
 It is a privilege to have Christian free schools
 and we who are in a Christian environment might easily take it for granted
 But then I want to remind you of a section that could be read in the Swedish newspaper as late as now in June
 where it said, religious free schools should be closed until 2030
 No, we say, no!
 If you are about to start high school, come and join us
 But if you are not about to start high school or maybe have left school behind you for a long time
 Join us and pray for both high school and our Christian schools and for all Christian schools out there in the country
 We need, it is a place where young people are brought up,
 to find security and be able to be comforted in their faith while they are being comforted in their education
 So we must remember to keep our Christian schools high
 Thank you!
 Let's give a bigger hand, come on, come on!
 Hallelujah! We believe in Christian schools!
 Very good morning dear church!
 Good morning dear congregation!
 My name is Willem Männister
 And I work as a missions coordinator here at Waterfly
 And it's time to take up a missions offering this morning
 And during this conference, you have heard very much about Europe and Asia, right?
 And those are the two main focus areas that we have
 But we do work in other places as well
 And one of those places is Central Asia
 Can you say Afghanistan?
 Now, me and my wife, we have lived several years in Afghanistan
 And even if Afghanistan is not so much in the news right now
 Unfortunately I have to say
 The situation is very, very bad
 Taliban is ruling today
 All the benefits and all the rights that people had are gone
 Especially for women
 Right now women cannot study
 They cannot work
 They have to wear burkas
 They can't even leave the home without a husband
 Or some male from the family
 Now the suicide rate for women is skyrocketing in Afghanistan right now
 Child marriage is skyrocketing in Afghanistan
 People don't have money for food so they sell their daughters
 And it feels like there is no hope
 But in Christ we have hope
 In Christ we have hope
 Now we as Word of Life, we are working even today inside Afghanistan
 And we do that throughout church in Tajikistan
 Which is the north country from Afghanistan
 Tajikistan is a little tricky place as well
 It's a Muslim nation
 That has only 0.7% Christians
 0.7%
 And that includes everyone
 Catholics and Orthodox
 And that includes all
 Catholics and Orthodox and Protestants
 Now one of the key things
 If you want to run a church in an environment and a nation like this
 Is that you need to own the property and the church buildings you have
 Otherwise it's very easy to be closed down
 Now just three months ago
 I had the privilege to go and visit our church in Tajikistan
 And I have some great news
 It's a very long story to tell which I'm not going to do now
 But there is a miracle that has happened
 And I have a picture here
 And our church has been able to
 Wow that's interesting
 I feel like an angel or a ghost
 Feels like an angel
 Can you get it a little better?
 Now just recently
 Our church in Tajikistan has been able to buy this property
 Now give a hand for God, this is a real miracle
 So now they are on the process of building a big hall
 A place for Bible school
 A place for youth work
 They are planning to build a restaurant and a cafeteria to serve people
 Now this place will not only be a spirit but also a physical center of missions for Central Asia
 And we want to stand here and pray for God
 And we want to stand together with them
 And they have been sending teams all the time
 Very much to Uzbekistan and other neighboring countries
 And every month we send people in into Afghanistan
 To meet with people
 To meet with people
 To pray with people
 To give hope to people
 And this is something that is a calling over us
 And this morning I want to invite you to be a part of this
 This is actually the last missions we take during this conference
 And I just invite you to be part of what God is doing in one of the most hostile times
 To be part of what God is doing in one of the most hostile and difficult places in the world
 To be part of what God is doing in one of the most hostile and difficult places for Christian faith
 Amen, let's pray
 Heavenly Father, even if doors are closed
 You still have a way into the hearts
 And Lord we pray a way into the hearts of people in Central Asia
 And here we pray a way into the hearts of Central Asia
 Let your gospel
 Bring that hope to people they need
 Give hope to people they need
 In the name of Jesus we pray
 Amen, amen
 And there are many different ways we can give
 There will be collect boxes at the exits if you want to give cash
 There is swish, there is vips
 There are instructions for that on the screens
 So if you are with us online there are also opportunities to just click on give a gift
 So you can also be part of what God is doing in these places
 Thank you for your gift
 Amen
 Amen
 Hallelujah, what a wonderful God we have
 God is good
 God is good
 We thank you Jesus for you died on the cross for us
 We never want to forget
 We always want to give thanks to you Jesus
 We thank you Jesus for your love
 God is good
 God is good
 Jesus, for you died on the cross for us.
 We will never forget.
 We will never forget all the good things you have done for us.
 Help us understand the sacrifice on the cross more, Lord,
 and its meaning for our lives.
 Right now, we just want to remind ourselves of your cross, Lord,
 what you have done for us.
 That the cross is enough, Lord.
 That the cross is everything, Lord. You are everything, Lord.
 Thank you, Jesus.
 And I will sing of your goodness forevermore.
 Worthy is your name, Jesus.
 You deserve the praise.
 Worthy is your name.
 Worthy is your name, Jesus.
 You deserve the praise.
 Worthy is your name.
 And now my shame is gone.
 And now my shame is gone.
 I stand amazed in your love undeniable.
 Your praise goes on.
 Your praise goes on and on.
 And I will sing of your goodness forevermore.
 Worthy is your name, Jesus.
 You deserve the praise.
 Worthy is your name.
 Worthy is your name, Jesus.
 You deserve the praise.
 Worthy is your name.

 You're the name above all names.
 Be exalted now in the heavens.
 As your glory fills this place.
 You love to serve our praise.
 You're the name above all names.
 Oh, I will sing to you like he's loved.
 You're the name above all names.
 Oh, I will sing to you like he's loved.
 You're the name above all names.
 You're the name above all names.
 Oh, oh, oh.
 Worthy is your name.
 Jesus.
 You deserve the praise.
 Worthy is your name.
 Worthy is your name.
 Jesus.
 You deserve everything.
 Worthy is your name.
 Worthy is your name.
 Jesus.
 You deserve everything.
 Worthy is your name.
 Worthy is your name.
 Jesus.
 You deserve everything.
 Worthy is your name.
 Just lift your hands for a moment in the presence of God.
 Just lift your hands for a moment in the presence of God.
 He's here, he's here, he's here.
 He's here, he's here, he's here.
 There's something beautiful.
 When we come together and when we worship the Lord.
 That's where the Lord inhabits with his presence.
 I believe that the address of our Lord is when we worship him as the Bible says.
 Your worship makes a difference this morning, not only in your life.
 But you need to know the moment you open your mouth and you worship the Lord that God is changing your city.
 He's changing your family, he's changing your neighborhood.
 You don't just worship this morning, you're actually doing spiritual warfare.
 If you will realize the atmosphere we're in right now.
 That's not just for me.
 But it's for my city.
 It's for Sweden.
 It's for all Europe.
 I believe that our worship here in this place will impact the nations.
 Come on church, so lift our hands.
 And can we call out the name of Jesus?
 Because there is no other name like the name Jesus.
 Come let's call out the name of Jesus.
 Come let's sing the name Jesus.
 Jesus, you're worthy.
 You're worthy.
 You're worthy.
 Come on, worthy is your name.
 Come on, man, write it down in your mouth.
 Yes.
 Yes, yes.
 I really believe that right now that people are already getting filled with the power of the Holy Spirit.
 I hear the words, fill your horn with oil.
 I believe it's a word for pastors and leaders in this room.
 Don't mourn about the past.
 Don't cry about what God has done the last 10, 20, 30 years.
 But prophet, you have to rise.
 Fill your horn with oil.
 Because there is a David generation that needs the anointing of God.
 Too long we were talking about the good old days.
 But I believe that the best days of the church are still ahead of us.
 So fill your horn with oil.
 Get filled with the power to anoint a generation.
 The prophet Samuel got up.
 Fills his horn with oil.
 And anointed a generation.
 Instead of mourning about Saul.
 Come into the presence.
 Fill your horn with oil.
 And release the anointing for this next generation.
 I believe that we see a global revival right now in Europe, in Asia.
 I believe that the best days of the church are still ahead of us.
 We need to speak it before we see it.
 So we declare revival.
 We speak revival in Sweden.
 We believe that this nation will come back to the Lord.
 The time of mourning is over.
 We believe.
 And I really even want to speak to this church.
 This church has been known.
 For sending people all over the world.
 God's beautiful churches all over the world.
 Because of what God has done in this place.
 I pray that God will exceed everything that happened in the past.
 I believe the best churches are yet to be built.
 I believe that powerful nations will rise.
 And declare the name of Jesus.
 We thank you for your presence God.
 We thank you for your presence.
 We thank you for being here.
 I cannot get enough from this sweet presence.
 I am so grateful to serve today alongside you.
 To receive together.
 I received the word yesterday personally from my family and from my church.
 I took the word of the person yesterday for my family.
 We believe for a building.
 I speak it.
 I know we will see it.
 I am so grateful.
 I told the team I could fly tomorrow night already because I got what I needed.
 But I am ready for what God has for this morning.
 Can we just maybe take a moment and just give Jesus our biggest praise.
 Come on church.
 We love you Jesus.
 Come on.
 Let's worship him.
 Let us worship him.
 Jesus thank you Jesus.
 Yes.
 Wow.
 You may be seated.
 What an honor to be here.
 What an honor to be here.
 I fell in love with Stockholm with Sweden beautiful nation.
 I fell in love with Stockholm with this beautiful nation.
 You got a lot of beautiful cities but most beautiful cities are crowded.
 Yes you have many beautiful cities but many cities are overcrowded.
 But I see you guys like space here.
 I see you like some space here.
 It has been amazing like 36 hours here.
 It has been fantastic 36 hours.
 Last night with the youth.
 Last night with the youth.
 We prayed for the 12 years old.
 We prayed for the 12 year olds.
 We called all the 12 years old.
 We called all the 12 year olds.
 It was 1 am in the morning.
 It was 1 am in the night.
 And I told the 12 years old trust me no one in your age has such a cool time like you right now.
 We met them at 1 am in the morning and I will never forget that.
 With the new leadership team of dropped the space where young people can encounter the lord.
 Thank you the entire management team because you create space
 and young people can meet the lord.
 Thank you for this house.
 Thanks for this house.
 Thanks for this house.
 It is good to see my friends from Russia.
 Sorry to bother you but it was all about your beautiful wife.
 I was at this house.
 My first church was in Moscow because we were there at the devil's universe.
 But still we have the title of the temple of God.
 And still impacted of what God has done over there. It's beautiful to see you guys.
 So encouraged by your faith.
 Today I want to read a verse with you in Psalm 51.
 I've been asking myself already over 10 years.
 One question.
 How can David be called the man after God's own heart?
 When I said 10 years, some of you were like, wow, you look 20.
 I just turned 30. Actually, I got a wonderful, beautiful wife and two beautiful daughters.
 I have a picture. Can we show a picture?
 I'm one of those beautiful Nylons. My wife Bethlehem.
 These girls are worshipping the Lord.
 And yesterday I prayed for a boy.
 And yesterday I prayed for a boy.
 I need my little football player.
 My little football player.
 So I can retire when I'm 50.
 Take care of this contract.
 I should bring greetings from my wife and my family.
 I will say hello to my wife and my family.
 As a family we are asking ourselves how can we be a family that reflects the heart of God.
 And family is asking ourselves how can we be a family that reflects God's heart.
 In the Bible it was called the man after God's heart.
 And in Psalm 51, 9-11 maybe we see why.
 And it says David is actually praying a prayer of repentance.
 It says hide your face from my sins.
 And blood out my iniquities.
 Created me a clean heart.
 Renew a right spirit within me.
 Cast me not away from your presence.
 And take not your holy spirit from me.
 What a heart that David has.
 He's actually saying God you can take all my kingdoms.
 You can take all my fame.
 But what I want is your spirit.
 You can take everything from me.
 But please don't take your spirit from me.
 I believe that the church needs to come to the place.
 Where we say God take our buildings.
 Take our lights.
 Take our performance.
 But do not take your spirit.
 It is the spirit of God that makes the difference.
 I don't need nothing else but the spirit of God.
 Because where the spirit of God is.
 There is freedom.
 There is joy.
 There is healing.
 There is healing.
 What a prayer.
 What a prayer.
 But is that the reason.
 Why we read in 1 Samuel chapter 13 verse 14 that David is after the heart of God.
 Is that it?
 Is that why we read in the first book of the psalm that David is a man after God's heart.
 In Sunday school.
 When they were teaching us the bible.
 When they were teaching us the bible.
 I am so grateful for my Sunday school teachers.
 I am so grateful for my Sunday school teachers.
 Because I was a tough little boy.
 Because I was a tough little boy.
 I would mess up always the children's service.
 I always ruined the children's meetings.
 Till this day our Sunday school teachers says we don't believe and we can't imagine that God is using you now.
 But at that time they were teaching us about David against Goliath.
 How you can have victory in the name of Jesus.
 You can have victory in the name of Jesus.
 But no one was sharing the story.
 Of David and Bathsheba.
 Because we like the heroic stories.
 We like the stories of victory.
 We like the stories of success.
 We like the stories of success.
 But sometimes life looks like failure.
 But it doesn't mean that you have to stay there.
 And I am honest.
 I can learn more about the story from David and Bathsheba than from David and Goliath.
 And I ask myself.
 How in the world.
 Can someone.
 Like David.
 Who committed adultery.
 Who committed adultery.
 Who murdered the man.
 Who did all of this.
 Be called the man after God's own heart.
 And most churches David would have no platform.
 But he is in the Bible.
 That's the question that I was asking myself.
 Why?
 And I want to take you to that journey.
 I will take you through a journey.
 Three years ago I was in Israel.
 And I had the privilege to teach young people about the Bible.
 It was like a Bible school.
 It was a group from Switzerland.
 Three years ago I was in Israel.
 I had a Bible teaching with a group of young people from Switzerland.
 And we had like those days where we would travel into different places.
 Look at the historic places.
 Biblical places.
 And we had like a Jewish Hebrew tour guide.
 And he asked us.
 Why you guys think David was called the man after God's own heart.
 We were driving into a place.
 Where I knew.
 That David was hiding when Saul wanted to kill him.
 So I thought maybe David's integrity had the opportunity to kill.
 But he says I'm not touching the anointed one.
 Could it be that that's the reason?
 He looked at me.
 It's like you western pastors.
 No.
 Then I'm like okay but then it has to be repentance.
 It has to be Psalm 51.
 Create a clean heart, a right spirit.
 And he's like you think it's repentance?
 And I'm like yeah.
 Because I believe.
 Repentance leads actually to revival.
 When we study revival history.
 Like every revival what we see happen through repentance.
 When people were turning away from idols.
 Turning towards God.
 And he said it's good.
 But it's not it.
 And then he said a sentence.
 That really shocked me.
 And I will give you later the answer of what he told me.
 But we need to just hold attention a little bit.
 But he said something.
 He said in our culture.
 Repentance is normal.
 Repentance is in our daily prayer.
 And the crazy thing is right now in church or in our western society it feels like repentance feels so radical.
 But the reality is that we are not in a place where we can't be.
 The reality is repentance is not radical.
 The problem is we have normalized sin so much in our lives that we have forgotten how to repent.
 And we don't want to talk about repentance.
 But in my bible it says.
 In James confess your sins to one another.
 And he will be able to heal us.
 So healing is connected to confession.
 Friends repentance isn't shame.
 It's freedom.
 Conviction is not condemnation.
 It's an invitation.
 Grace will never ignore sin.
 But it will transform it.
 It always starts with one thing.
 We have lost the awareness of sin in our lives.
 When the Lord spoke that into my heart.
 We lost the awareness of sin in our lives.
 We just have it part of our lives.
 The awareness and the weight of our sin.
 Will bring us actually into a place of prayer and humility that we are in need of a savior that saves us.
 It takes us into a place of prayer and humility that we can ask for a savior.
 I don't understand why we carry sin with us when Jesus Christ died on the cross and took all our sin already.
 Until you see the weight of your sin you will never see the need of a savior.
 David had a heart that pleased God.
 He had a repentant spirit.
 A repentant spirit.
 It's not just that you are light with sin.
 When I was teaching about the awareness of sin.
 I realized that sometimes people there's like memories things coming up.
 When sin comes to your surface it's not to destroy you.
 It's actually just to hand it to Jesus.
 Look what David is praying.
 For I know my transgression.
 And my sin is ever before me.
 Against you only have I sinned.
 And have done even what's in your sight.
 First of all we don't hurt people we hurt the heart of God.
 And some of us we became okay in hurting God.
 We normalized sin.
 We lost the awareness of sin.
 And we just worship our hands.
 We just come Sunday to church.
 Why we live in bitterness?
 Why we live in unforgiveness?
 Before you lift your hands and you worship.
 You come out of sacrifice.
 Go back to your brother.
 And ask for forgiveness.
 But we came so familiar with our sin.
 We learned how to worship with our sin.
 But let me teach you something.
 The moment you cast your sin to Jesus.
 There is a freedom that comes in your life.
 That freedom no one can take away.
 We need to come back to repent.
 I know it's not the best preaching to hear on a Saturday morning.
 But it's so important.
 It's so important.
 Look David says in verse 5.
 Behold.
 I was brought forth in iniquity and sin that my mother conceived me.
 I was born this way.
 I was born this way.
 I was born this way.
 That may be right.
 You may be born in sin but you were never meant to live in it.
 You may be born in sin but you were never meant to live in it.
 You might be right now in sin but you don't know the truth.
 You might be right now in sin but you don't have to die in sin.
 You may be born in sin but you don't have to stay there.
 Because the bible says you have to be born again.
 It's not an excuse I was born this way.
 I was born with this addiction.
 I was born with this sickness.
 I was born with confusion.
 No no no you have to be born again.
 And that's where the change comes.
 We need to bring these old teachings back.
 We need to bring these old teachings back.
 We need to be born again by the presence of God.
 So many young people are like yeah but
 we see signs and we see reasons and studies that I've been born this way and that's the reason.
 You're born this way is not an excuse.
 You have to repent.
 Repentance is not just a fresh start.
 It means I need to be born again.
 Can we have like David this repentant heart?
 You have the freedom during the service.
 When you need to repent to the Lord to do it.
 Trust because you will hear the word even much lighter.
 The second thing David had
 It was not just a repentant spirit.
 It was a shepherd heart.
 You don't have to be a pastor to have a shepherd heart.
 Sometimes we think it's just like a pastor.
 And yeah for sure our evangelists they need shepherd hearts.
 I believe we're all called to have that heart of Jesus.
 If Jesus is called the great shepherd.
 Like I'm teaching right now our church I'm like I'm honest guys.
 We need to create a shepherd heart.
 Because you cannot expect that I will shepherd every person that walks into our doors.
 But I said you guys need to start to shepherd people.
 Lead them to the word of God.
 This is how discipleship works.
 When the church becomes a place of worship.
 When the church becomes active.
 And have a shepherd heart.
 David took hand of the sheep.
 And he smelled like sheep.
 And first Samuel 16 verse 11
 And he asked him are all the boys you have?
 And he answered he is the youngest but behold he is keeping the sheep.
 While they were searching for a king David was faithfully tending a sheep.
 You want to be used by God?
 You want to be chosen by God?
 Then let him find you serving.
 Let him find you taking care of your sheep.
 He calls the one who is in the field serving the Lord.
 I don't know for who this is but you have to come back to serve God again.
 There is no way around the best leaders are the best servant.
 Let God find you serving.
 We love attending conferences.
 How next time you serve at a conference.
 Don't be a consumer.
 Be a contributor.
 Trust me the kingdom of God is so much more fun.
 When we don't just receive but when we give.
 While David was taking care of the sheep.
 While David was fighting the bear and the lion.
 That's the reason he could look at the giant.
 And he could defeat the giant.
 David had a shepherd heart.
 And actually God found him.
 Serving.
 There is no way around serving.
 There is no way.
 I love serving in my church.
 It's now a year ago where God called us back to Frankfurt.
 I was like Jonah running away from that city.
 Because of my experience I had.
 I said God I don't want to go back to the city.
 I was in Stuttgart in the south that's where the bible belt is.
 And I love the bible belt.
 But God says go to Frankfurt.
 I have a calling.
 I asked why me.
 You have been faithful with the youth.
 You have been serving the young people.
 You were listening to their problems.
 And I needed someone that is not just leading a church.
 And someone that will lead a city.
 We are not just called to lead a church we are called to lead a city to Jesus.
 If you serve in the church.
 So your nation comes back to Jesus.
 September 15th.
 2024.
 We are launching in Frankfurt.
 They told us there is no church.
 Over 200 in Frankfurt.
 There is no church in the last years.
 Like you are too young.
 You are too little.
 But God found our serving.
 It's not about your age it's about the spirit of God.
 When we launched on September 15th.
 1000 people showed up to the first service.
 Since then we have baptized over 100 people.
 And we have seen a generation of city coming to Jesus.
 And we think.
 This is happening in Germany.
 Young people coming to the Lord.
 Last time a pastor came to my church.
 And he is like there are a lot of young people.
 And I am like yes good.
 Because 80% of all church are old people.
 So if God has given us the young generation.
 I know this will have a future.
 He is like yeah but I see so many people live in sin.
 I am like yeah they are on a journey.
 But I rather preach to sinners that they need a savior than to people that are full of religion.
 The religious spirit cannot exist when you have a servant heart.
 Those who judge are always those who will never serve.
 Those who judge are always those who will never serve.
 I love that David.
 King David.
 He was chasing after God.
 Not after the crown.
 Could this be the third reason?
 Because he had a desire for God.
 David didn't long for fame saved your success.
 He longed for one thing.
 He longed for one thing.
 He wanted to be close to God.
 If I could ask for only one thing.
 If I could ask for one thing.
 It wouldn't be perfection.
 It would be your presence.
 No throne could satisfy.
 No army could protect.
 No victory could fulfill.
 I just want your presence.
 That was David's prayer.
 No army, no faith, nothing could destroy his inner.
 He wanted to have Jesus.
 It was holy.
 I need God.
 Blessed is the person that understands I got everything when I have God.
 Being close to God is joy.
 Being close to God is everything.
 The word tries to sell us something that when we have the riches of this world.
 That when we have the safety that we will become happy.
 That when we have the riches of this world.
 That when we have the safety that we will become happy.
 Let me tell you.
 The happiest people I have ever seen were those closest to the presence of God.
 I don't want to talk about that.
 But we have another message here.
 David, chase God.
 I'm chasing after God.
 David wanted to be close with God.
 David wanted to be close with God.
 Psalm 27 verse 4.
 Psalm 22 verse 4.
 One thing I have asked.
 One thing I have asked.
 That I will seek after.
 That I may dwell in the house of the Lord.
 That I may dwell in the house of the Lord.
 To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord.
 To inquire his temple.
 I'm so grateful that I was raised in church.
 My mom always shared with me the stories.
 Before you were born.
 Before you were born.
 A few months before we received Jesus in our life.
 My family came from the lineage of witchcraft.
 From both sides.
 My mom and my dad broke the curse.
 Mom and dad broke the curse.
 Received Jesus.
 At the same time.
 We were pregnant.
 Like two days before my birth.
 There was a prophet.
 That actually preach in Mexico.
 That flew to Germany.
 To Germany.
 And God told him to go to that hospital.
 Where my mom is laying.
 He brought some flowers.
 I just want to tell you.
 The devil wants to kill this young boy.
 But you pray over him.
 God will use him.
 As a voice for his generation.
 On my first birthday.
 In church.
 There was a prophetic word.
 And there was like this prophet.
 Says that today there is one boy.
 That is his birthday.
 Can you call him up?
 So I was raised with the stories.
 Being raised in church.
 Hearing that there is calling and destiny.
 And it's not that I'm just filled up with calling and destiny.
 So I can release it to another generation.
 So I can release it to my kids.
 So I've learned what it means.
 To dwell in the house of the Lord.
 There is no better place where you can be.
 Than in the presence of God.
 Oh in the presence of God.
 There is fullness of joy.
 In the presence of God is everything you need.
 Come on who is thankful for the presence of God in your life.
 Who is grateful that you grew up.
 So everyone needs to experience that.
 Everyone.
 So I made a decision.
 I said to my parents.
 When I was 16.
 How can it be.
 That we serve the Lord.
 That our family in Ethiopia.
 Is still doing things of old ways.
 I want to chase God not just for myself.
 I want to chase it for my family.
 When I was at that age we went to a village.
 And we preached the gospel.
 And we prayed the gospel.
 And we preached the gospel.
 To my whole family.
 I told my grandpa.
 I said I love you.
 But you need Jesus.
 He looked at me.
 He said look in this village it works different.
 We are praying to those trees.
 And they have been answering us.
 And I told him.
 Those trees will pass away but the word of God will remain forever.
 The word of God will remain forever.
 I preached the gospel.
 No one got saved.
 I never forget.
 So the second day.
 I said to my parents.
 Nothing happened.
 Third day.
 Preaching to my aunt.
 Uncle.
 I have some crazy Ethiopian uncles.
 And I said.
 Guys we cannot serve the Lord in Europe.
 And not see you with the Lord.
 Nothing happened.
 The years went by.
 When I was 26.
 10 years later.
 I got a phone call.
 From my cousin.
 He said we need to tell you something.
 When you preached 10 years ago.
 We were actually praying to Jesus that same night.
 But we were hiding our faith.
 So no one will know in our family.
 And I'm like wow.
 Sometimes we just have to plant a seed.
 I got a phone call.
 From other family members.
 You need to keep that for you.
 But we believe in Jesus.
 And I'm like oh my goodness.
 You both believe in Jesus.
 Are in the same family but you don't know from each other.
 Because you are afraid.
 We flew to Ethiopia.
 We prayed for them.
 And I saw many of my family's coming to the Lord.
 But I was still praying for my grandpa.
 Last year we got the phone call.
 He's in the capital city because he's sick.
 When he went to the capital city.
 Actually he was in the capital city.
 And he was praying for his family.
 And he was praying for his family.
 And he was praying for his family.
 And he was praying for his family.
 And he went to the capital city.
 Actually at his dead bed.
 He had the strength to go to church.
 He's like my grandson is a pastor.
 And there his daughters.
 They believe in Jesus.
 I may go to church.
 He went to church.
 He got touched by the Holy Spirit.
 And got baptized at the same day.
 Today he is with my father in heaven.
 Today he is with my father in heaven.
 And I was like.
 Isn't that amazing?
 That when we chase God.
 That God will bless the generation that comes.
 But I believe this is prophetic for someone.
 It's not just touching the generation.
 Three generations ahead.
 I believe the presence of God is so strong.
 That it can save your parents.
 It can save your grandparents.
 It can save your grandparents.
 It can save your grandparents.
 It goes three generations back.
 And three generations forward.
 Come on who believes it?
 For your family.
 I believe that you will see breakthrough in your family.
 But it starts with chasing God.
 When you put the presence of God above all.
 When you put the presence of God above all.
 I learned.
 If you chase God.
 God is not only chasing you.
 He's chasing your family.
 He's chasing your family.
 So there was still one person in our family.
 So there was still one person in our family.
 It was my grandmother.
 It was my grandmother.
 When my grandpa died.
 She said no I will not receive Jesus.
 And now she's sick.
 And now she's sick.
 And the same story.
 She's still alive.
 She went to church.
 And just four weeks ago.
 I received a phone call.
 I said Jesus Christ.
 My God is good.
 If God did it for us.
 If God did it for my family.
 I believe he can do it for you.
 I don't know for who you're praying.
 But some of you are praying for your kids.
 You're praying for your parents.
 You're praying for some family members.
 I believe if you chase God.
 He will chase your family.
 Who's ready to see his family saved?
 Amen.
 David chase God.
 But that's not it.
 Why?
 A man after God's own heart.
 A man after God's own heart.
 I know it.
 Maybe.
 Because David was a worshiper.
 David was a worshiper.
 You know.
 The devil had the privilege.
 When he was an angel to worship.
 So if there's anything that makes the devil angry.
 Is when we worship.
 There's something that makes the devil angry.
 There's something that makes the devil angry when we worship.
 Instead of bringing worship.
 Instead of taking worship to God.
 He put it to himself.
 And he was thrown into hell.
 And he was thrown into hell.
 David was a worshiper.
 When you read the Psalms.
 When you read about David in the Bible.
 When you read about David in the Bible.
 He doesn't introduce himself as a king.
 He doesn't introduce himself as a king.
 I'm David King.
 I'm David.
 Son of Jesse.
 Son of Jesse.
 God has lifted up.
 I'm a worshiper.
 I'm a worshiper.
 David introduced himself as a worshiper.
 Not as a king.
 I wish as leaders that we don't mix up our identity with our function.
 I wish as leaders that we don't mix up our identity with our function.
 Before you're a pastor or a leader.
 Before you're a pastor or a leader.
 You're a worshiper.
 presence of God. And that's the reason like every Saturday night
 what we're gonna do tonight with my wife at home before Sunday starts
 there's your church that's not our identity. I always pray this
 prayer this is your church God thank you that we can host thank you that we can
 be part of a revival where we see every Sunday over 500 people coming to the
 presence of God God thank you that we can see people getting baptized thank you
 that we can see that break right now in Germany but this is not our identity
 you know sometimes I ask myself if I when tomorrow I'm not the pastor of this
 church you know what I will be a happy father because before I'm a pastor I'm
 a worshiper I will worship Jesus 24-7 and watch every football game that I can watch
 Don't mix your identity with your function
 David knew and that's the reason he had this amazing heart I'm a worshiper before I'm here to rule
 before I'm here to reign before I'm here to give commands I receive commands I receive from the
 Holy Spirit his passion worship was louder than anything else and David worship no matter what
 David's heart wasn't dependent on circumstances he worshiped God in every season
 Psalm 34 verse 1 I will bless the Lord at all times not sometimes not few times
 I don't know for who this is but you need to start to worship again in your home it's beautiful
 where we worship here it's beautiful where we go on our knees here but I hope that your home is a
 worship place we need worshipers and behind closed doors because I know that the devil likes to
 steal your worship because if he gets your worship he has your identity and then you don't know who
 you are but look this is so important that your worship will turn back to you some of you you
 stopped singing songs to the Lord because of pain in your life but what will happen where you will
 turn your pain into praise I don't know for who this is but God is giving you worship back you
 will worship him again you will lift the name of Jesus and no one and nothing will stop you
 called to be a worshiper come on let's give Jesus Christ a shout of praise we're called to
 worship in every season in every season David was a worshiper David was a
 worshiper he knew how to worship it is so easy to worship what everything works good
 right when everything is perfect
 Lord I lift your name on high I love the old school songs it's like we love singing right
 you are mighty to save you still speak it oh it's so easy to worship when when you get a promotion
 when you got a promotion at work it's so easy to worship when my kids slept all night long I'll
 wake up and worship I'll wake up with gratefulness it's so easy but when everything goes wrong it's
 so hard that's reason job is saying I've heard from him but now I saw the Lord
 and he still worship the Lord even if I don't have nothing when my auntie died a horrible death
 she got murdered when that happened my heart was full of darkness and I knew the first thing I
 needed to do instead of like revenge I went on my knees and I was worshiping and I was singing
 and while I was singing God was changing my heart I never forget this moment and I could forgive
 and I could release because for us Christians death is just a bridge to a better place so
 death is never the end it's just the beginning I don't know for who this is you lost someone
 in your life and you stop worshipping the devil took your joy Christian life without joy is
 horrible trust me let's be worshippers like David and let's worship God at all times and he's faithful
 he's faithful I believe that some of your houses will turn to places of worship and you will
 worship Jesus and your kids will see how you worship him even in difficult seasons I believe
 this is where worship happens every time David had it but that's not it maybe I can have already
 someone on the piano my heart is really that we pray I waited that long to actually share before
 I share my last point what our Hebrew guy told us in Israel what he thinks from his context
 why David was a man after God's own heart we were on a journey we saw the shepherd heart
 we saw the repentant spirits he was chasing God and he was a worshiper and then he said something
 like David did something that's very uncommon in our culture he took responsibilities for his
 sin not carrying it but responsibility he was not wearing a mask he was not hiding he showed
 everything when sin happened to a lot of people even great men of God not every time but most
 time it's like they never existed like nothing is there it's like hiding because of shame
 but David didn't care about shame he didn't care how other people see him because in the
 religious culture it's important how people see you you want to look good you want to look nice
 you want to look busy reading the word it's more about outer appearance but David didn't care about
 the outer appearance he didn't care how he was looked like because David knew I'm a shepherd in
 my heart I have a repentant spirit I'm chasing God I'm a worshiper I don't care what people say
 about me I care what God says about me I'm not afraid of man I'm afraid of God I don't have the
 fear of man I have the fear of God David knew David not hiding it I'm not hiding it's here Lord
 It's here Lord
 and when he shared I'm wow wow it's amazing because we became so good in hiding
 David was a man after God's heart he was not hiding it anymore when the prophet came and
 confronted him
 no hiding he took responsibility
 he took responsibility he took responsibility but in my really journey of asking this question I
 came to a passage in the Bible that personally I think I cannot say that that's the reason
 David is a man after God's own heart I can't say that the reality is it's the combination all the
 combination of all these things but in act 13 verse 21 to verse 22
 oh I love this passage and afterward they asked for a king and God gave him
 and God gave them Saul the son of Kish a man of the tribe of Benjamin for 40 years
 and afterward they asked for a king who asked for a king
 God or the people Saul was a product of the desire that people had because the children of
 Israel said look everyone has a king so we want a king
 but when we read in context it hurts God because I'm your king but they said no no we need a king
 that helps us to win wars so now we started to trust the kings so I believe that kingship
 was implemented in the Bible first because people wanted it they wanted a king
 and then God anointed Saul yes
 but look what verse 22 says and when he removed him he raised up David to be their king
 a man after my own heart that I'm raising
 a man after my own heart could it be Europe conference could it be that Saul was the result
 of what people wanted and David was chosen by God picked by God raised by God to be a man
 after God's heart could it be that David is a man after God's own heart because God chose him
 I don't know about you but it makes sense man we needed a king that has the heart that looks like
 God but it's still in sin because King David was just foreshadowing the king of kings
 King David showed us that we need a greater king he showed the heart of God but he was not God
 that's the reason from the lineage of David we have the son of David and his name is Jesus
 he is the king of kings he's the rulers of lorule and he's not only with the heart of God
 he was God and he was perfect David is pointing to Jesus but what is with his failures
 what happened to all the people who failed? what's with his sin? his sin? Jesus knew
 when I enter into this world I come in a broken lineage because with me the curse will stop
 with me sin will die Jesus said with me the old will end I don't know for who this is
 but it will stop with Jesus so when Jesus comes in your life
 generational curses will break and there is a blessing generation of blessing it stopped with
 Jesus it stopped and ended with Jesus and there is no lineage of blessing
 and when you receive Jesus you become part of this lineage
 I believe the reason why David was called a man after God's own heart
 it's because God has chosen him before God has chosen him he found him serving
 so all the way along David had the right heart that God was looking to raise the king
 instead of impressing someone let's have the right heart and at God times the promotion will come
 the blessing will come the breakthrough will come because he has chosen you come on just speak
 it out I'm chosen by God come on speak it out I'm called by God speak it out there's power in your
 words I'm chosen by God to be a man a woman after his own heart I'm chosen to declare the
 goodness of God thank you Jesus let's all stand up thank you for your presence God
 yes
 yes
 thank you Jesus
 yes I'm coming back to the heart of worship
 yes coming back
 it's all about you Jesus I'm coming back to the heart of worship
 it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing I made when it's all about you
 it's all about you Jesus while every eyes are closed in the presence of God
 I'm asking you if this is your time to come back to the heart of worship when you're repenting
 it doesn't have to be a big sin it might be something small
 might be something small and it feels like you get right now like an awareness of it
 but it doesn't want you to carry that with you if this is you just raise your hand
 if this is you just raise your hand raise your hand just raise your hand
 yeah I need that I need that I need that
 I need that
 this is you thank you Holy Spirit if you're bold enough when you raise your hand
 I want to because repentance is always action if you raise your hand come to the front
 come to the front and have your altar moments we need that back where we have moments at the altar
 we need these moments I remember visiting Brooklyn Tabernacle for three years every
 Tuesday morning and the altars were open already before the service started so people were
 repenting all the time I remember Tuesday nights in Brooklyn New York at 6 p.m. when the service
 was starting at seven that the altar was already filled with tears with prayer of repentance
 because it's normal let's learn the habit to even ask God show me your
 I want to repent from it some of you have to repent from not even serving
 some of you have believed lies in your life lies about God about your family but God is breaking that off you
 in the name of Jesus I pray for freedom right now just come to the front just come to the front
 it's repentance that will lead you to revival it's repentance that leads you to revival
 yes yes
 thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
 I see families reunited
 friendships restored
 don't say it's impossible
 repent say sorry God that I thought this way
 how can I hold grudge and bitterness in my heart and unforgiveness and worship the Lord
 before you worship before you bring your sacrifice
 sacrifice
 there's still more people coming
 I can have some of the even leadership
 I see the hand of God over your life
 you will serve the Lord in a mighty way
 God's hand is over your life
 I even see a church that will be birthed out
 you will be a powerful passer for the Lord
 the hand of God is over your life
 God is going to use you in a mighty way
 He's using both of you
 and I pray that the anointing of God will fall over your life
 His hand is over you
 Thank you Holy Spirit
 Thank you Holy Spirit
 Thank you Holy Spirit
 Thank you for a morning of repentance
 Your repentance will not only lead you to revival it will release you to your destiny
 the only reason the devil can block your destiny is because you have blocked the way where God is releasing your destiny
 so if you need to come forward come forward
 come forward and repent to the Lord
 Thank you Jesus
 Thank you for your sister
 Thank you for her life
 The Lord will release you to your destiny
 too long you were running away
 the time of excuses are over

 Another meeting here at the European Conference
 that we have been blessed with
 and we are back here in Kanal 10 Studio
 We have these broadcasts where we get the opportunity
 to talk with different speakers, guests and employees
 in the words of life both before and after the meetings
 and there are many of our viewers who have heard
 and said that you like to have these broadcasts
 and that it will be a blessing for you
 and we will soon be able to introduce the next guest here
 It will be a very exciting conversation
 But PO, what do you say about this meeting?
 As usual, you feel touched down in the heart
 and I think about it, I have learned over the years
 that a meeting, long or short, it's not the deciding factor
 it can mean life transformation
 and maybe it became such a meeting for you this day
 If it didn't for you, you should know that it's people
 who have been affected by both the spirit and body
 of this meeting, just like every other meeting
 and we have a few meetings left in the conference
 so we want to encourage you to join us
 until the end of the conference
 We had a guest here before the event
 and I promised to give him some tips about his book
 Frad Masri, who works with the Muslims to reach the Gospel
 and this book is called Hope's Ambassadors to Muslims
 with the phrase, to build bridges to the Gospel
 I recommend that book, and the warmest one
 you will love to read it
 Frad has written many other books as well
 but as far as I know, this is the only one that is available
 and it's been translated into Swedish
 Now, we will move on to today's guest
 who is Magnus Västergård
 Welcome Magnus!
 Thank you!
 You are sitting here because you are in the highest grade
 a school person, was it always like this?
 Of course you would work with schools
 Not at all, I worked for many years in the church
 but in the last 11 years I have worked as head of the school
 and took the task as a continuation of that important task
 I believe that the church exists in all worlds
 Exactly, and there are a number of schools in the heart of the assembly
 if we may put it that way
 and I know that you recently had a party, what was it that was celebrated?
 We celebrated 40 years
 We started school in 1985
 with Ulf and Birgitta Ekman and Michael Svedlund in the lead
 and then, before the free school reform, they started
 and worked very hard for a couple of years
 to get the school approved
 and then many more years to get a contribution
 but it has grown from 34 students to today almost 1000 children and students
 from preschool to high school
 including adapted elementary and high school students
 who were previously called high school
 so we have basically all school forms in our business
 and it is really fun to work with them
 I also know that you are not only engaged for your own school
 but also for Christian's education in Storten
 and I thought we could talk a little bit about that
 it is one of those subjects that always feels relevant
 and that is always discussed
 if you could give us a few minutes here in all simplicity
 and tell our viewers why we need Christian preschool
 I think we need Christian preschools
 because this is an expression
 partly for the diagonal care
 In Sweden, the church has been the initiator for education, care, care
 the whole social system has grown from the love of Christians to more people
 but then I think that today in Sweden
 where the secular humanistic paradigm is so strong
 we need Christian schools to preserve the Christian ethics in our country
 we need them to preserve the Christian culture
 many of the countries that we build on have deep roots in the Christian ethics
 and that is also what the curriculum says
 but if we lose the foundation it will disappear
 because these worlds will disappear
 and that is why we need Christian schools
 Yes, as I said and I think everyone knows
 that this is a very discussed topic
 and I am also in a Christian preschool
 and one is surprised by the feeling that the possibilities to run a Christian preschool
 or as it is called, a confessional
 that it will become narrower and narrower
 how is your experience of that?
 I agree, there was an unheard of fight in the 80s
 that you had to start
 and then there was a time of a little bigger freedom
 and now it has become narrower and narrower
 and recently the liberals said that Christian schools should be banned until 2030
 we should remember that they talk about religious preschools
 but there are about 60 Christian schools
 many have more Christian preschools in the country
 but there are two Jewish and one Muslim schools
 so when they talk about the religious schools
 it is the Christian schools they talk about
 and for some reason they want to ban them
 and I think that a lot of this is about
 that just as I said before the secular humanistic paradigm has become so strong
 you think that this is a neutral re-enactment
 but forget that it is a life-enactment
 it is also a majority religion in the country today
 and then you are afraid of what challenges this re-paradigm
 we live without thinking about it in a society
 that is very interested in equality
 for example, there are in all, if I understand correctly
 Scandinavian countries and many other opportunities
 to go home to school but it is totally banned in Sweden
 it is banned in Sweden and it is also very interesting
 to compare with other European countries
 sometimes it sounds like this with Christian schools
 would be something unique to Sweden
 but here the Christian schools are also under this pressure
 and should be as similar to other schools as possible
 while in Norway, for example, you require that you show
 that you have a Christian profile so that you can be found
 you have to be different from the other schools
 like in Germany, in Holland, 70% of all schools are Christian schools
 so this is a very unique Swedish angle
 and it is also so, we stick out in all evaluation surveys
 Sweden is the world's most extreme country
 we are extremely individualistic and we are extremely secular
 and we were told here before the preaching
 that you produce students with good grades
 and who will continue in life
 we have good school results
 we have good school results and the Christian schools
 generally in Sweden show that we have good school results
 Christian Free School Council's surveys show that we are better
 both when it comes to teaching
 we have a very strong integrated perspective
 sometimes we blame the Christian schools for being segregated
 but that is not true
 we have, we collect students
 all the Christian schools collect students from all different socio-economic backgrounds
 and we have a very high number of students from other ethnic backgrounds as well
 so here I would say that the Christian schools are one of the most integrated schools in the country
 and that really contributes to everyone feeling at home
 I usually say that because it is true
 I really have the example that in Sweden
 some of the students from some of the richest businessmen
 and we have the single immigrant mother
 and they are best friends
 and here is the integration
 it is so beautiful, just the thought of it
 that a Christian school becomes a meeting place for people from all different backgrounds
 and it becomes one, and it becomes one for not only Christian youth
 but we see that many youth come from completely non-religious backgrounds
 Muslim backgrounds, other religious backgrounds
 and they thrive so well because here they can be themselves
 it is something that again, you think that the secular life-saving system is neutral
 and that in some way that would make you be yourself
 but it is not like that, we have reflected on how you should be yourself
 and it expresses the students when they come
 here I had to be myself, no matter what life-saving system
 and when they change schools they say, oh how sad it was
 exactly
 one thing I am thinking about is that relatively often
 it is not natural for a Christian to favor a Christian free school
 even if there is a possibility for that
 there is a thought that the children need to be exposed to the world
 and on the other hand also to be a Christian voice in that world
 how do you think about this Magnus?
 I think that every child, every student needs a Christian school
 the one who thinks like that, I know that thought process as you say Pio
 it exists there, but many have not reflected on the social development
 and how it looks today
 I am not older than when I went to the lower levels
 we actually sang still psalms in the ordinary municipal school in the morning
 but from there we have walked so many miles
 and the secular paradigm again is so strong
 and so pushes in its values so strongly
 I mean that every student needs to go to a Christian school
 for a chance to develop themselves
 Christian schools some think that they are narrow bubbles or indoctrinating
 but it is not, they are incredibly wide, incredibly open
 but there is a chance to grow for yourself
 and we know that the research shows that a family may take 15 minutes a day
 to talk to their children
 except for this ordinary stress that you have come now
 we are going to school, start like that, but 15 minutes
 but you spend maybe a six hours a day in school
 so it is so, if you care about the values that are going to be placed in the children
 it is so important that you think about your school choice
 This we could talk about for a long time
 but I think Magnus, now I do not have it up to date for me
 but if we have viewers who say that it is still interesting
 I need to look up a little more
 what information do you find about this, I think about the Christian Free School Council for example
 The Christian Free School Council has a good website
 christianfrieskola.se
 so there is both a lot of information about the Christian schools
 and addresses to all the Christian schools in the country
 so that you can find your nearest local Christian Free School
 and then it is just like Shania said earlier
 actually youth who are going to start high school
 and then I feel like I want to go to the Anskar High School
 where do you find that information?
 then you go to anskargymnasiet.se
 very simple
 and there is all the information about how to apply
 and we have six different programs
 five theoretical programs
 basically all the theoretical programs
 and also practical programs
 and we have, as I said earlier, also adapted
 it is a big high school
 exciting, exciting
 I don't know how it is going in time, but you have a good eye
 we will get a little more after this
 after our calculation here
 but for example, how
 just a thought, there are these 60
 around 60 Christian schools around the country
 but say that you live in a place and you have a little different meetings
 is there a possibility, is it possible to start new Christian schools
 or how is the process there?
 it is absolutely possible to start new Christian schools
 and that is where the Christian Free School Council is very welcome
 my advice would be to go together
 either if you are a larger group or if you go to a group of groups
 and start a preschool
 because it is so easy to start a preschool
 and then you get a start and a base for how you can work with educational issues
 so I think that
 that all meetings that do not have a preschool
 or not linked to a preschool should
 raise more meeting leaders, I say to the viewers
 raise the meeting leaders that we should have a preschool
 it is needed
 and I would also encourage all viewers to
 ask for a prayer for Christian schools every day
 I often say that ask for a prayer stick
 everyone should say that you should just ask for five minutes
 there will be many minutes when you should ask for five minutes
 and if you ask God for the stick of Christian schools today
 if we all do that
 then we are a very strong prayer together
 very good
 fantastic
 I wish I could have gone to a Christian school
 it would be amazing
 I went to a Bible school for three years
 and you really got this community
 and get to feel that you did not need
 to be questioned all the time
 because in school I was a lonely Christian
 and even today
 it was still quite many years ago
 today it is much much
 more difficult
 it is much more
 we still had
 Christians
 on the religious knowledge
 could you get a pastor and be able to share a little and such
 but it is quite certain that they do not have on them
 as we said before, it has become tighter and tighter
 the possibility to just mention something about the Christ
 the Swedish Christian Council did a survey
 that shows that over half of the Christian nuns
 have experienced the torture of their faith
 today in school and not rarely by teachers unfortunately
 and I do not believe that again
 I do not think that they are evil or that they are aware
 that they
 are unreflected in the question
 yes exactly
 we thank you so much for coming here
 thank you for coming
 and feel free to ask for both
 the Ansgar school but also all these Christian free schools
 in our country, they need our support
 especially now when politicians
 start to face this even more
 we need to be able to have a Christian school
 in Sweden, it is very important
 at 6.45 pm we are back with David Ekerbrings
 preaching
 and before that at 6.00 pm you can watch
 on TV play
 the Lovsångskonsert
 have a nice day
 Thank you for watching
