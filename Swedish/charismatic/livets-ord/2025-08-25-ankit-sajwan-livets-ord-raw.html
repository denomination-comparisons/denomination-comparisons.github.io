[Transcription: Whsiper Medium - English]

 I think it has been so interesting.
 You have really heard more about the whole of the Word of Life.
 The Holy Word of Life is a great, one might say, in various ways, the best of the word.
 And yet we must remember that the most that happened in the Word of Life's history did not happen here in Sweden,
 but it happened in other parts of the world.
 And a lot of it is about the mission, we have understood that.
 We have heard about Asia, we have heard about India, we have heard...
 Yes, we are in Asia, of course, and Vietnam, etc.
 But we have also heard a lot about the Balkans, and that is why I think it is very fun to have a Balkan-ess
 visiting us here in the studio before the meeting tonight.
 Michael Undin, it was great that you could join us in the studio.
 It was very nice to be here.
 I got to know Michael, I think it must have been in the early 90s,
 and the first time, I remember it now, was when you came together with a good friend,
 Bengt Vedermalm, and came to Säfsjö.
 We had just started our own mission, we had a new meeting,
 and we heard about what was happening in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union.
 We said, we have to mission.
 And then you came, you and Michael, and you both worked here at Life's Word,
 and with focus on Eastern Europe.
 And that evening, when you came to the meeting with us,
 God spoke in my heart, and he said,
 Put down your mission work.
 It was so easy to encourage.
 And then he said, mission together with Life's Word.
 And we did, and we have worked together a lot over the years,
 and I have appreciated a lot of relationships with you,
 and what we have seen together.
 But the fact is that you started on the Balkan pretty far ahead of me.
 Can you tell us how it started, and how did you get involved,
 the mission in general, and maybe the Balkan in particular?
 The mission started, I went to U-MUS-learing school in 1980,
 also together with Bengt, we are roommates.
 And then we had a trip to the Soviet Union, which entered the school.
 And that totally changed both me and Bengt's life.
 So before that I had never thought about the mission,
 but after that it has been a mission, it's been 45 years now.
 It was actually in June 1980 that we went, so it's been 45 years.
 So there has been a lot of focus in Eastern Europe.
 We lived in the Czech Republic in the 90s,
 you were down there many times with the meeting and stuff.
 And then we moved to India in 1997,
 started up in the East India.
 But the Balkans have been pretty, we started to travel a lot in Bulgaria,
 especially in the late 80s, there was a lot in Bulgaria.
 There has also been a lot.
 And you also traveled and took in literature and Bible, right?
 Yes, I also work as a Bible-sweeper all the time.
 I came to the Bible in 1984, before that we lived in Vienna
 and were Bible-sweepers all the time.
 Wow.
 It's very nice to sit on the CV, right?
 You don't hear it that often, Bible-sweepers.
 Not everyone can do that.
 But I assume there were a lot of adventures with that?
 Yes, a lot of adventures with that.
 But you always come home again, as Carl Gustaf says.
 Yes, even so.
 Now you have a pretty long perspective on the Balkans,
 and I think many know that in the late 80s and early 90s,
 as communism fell, there was an incredible openness in many ways for the Gospel.
 And then that was unfortunately canceled, maybe a little earlier in the 90s,
 the second half of the 90s.
 But if you were to give a kind of overview over all these years that you have,
 if we look specifically at the Balkans,
 a kind of overview, how would you describe it in short?
 It depends, often when you talk about the Balkans you talk about the former Yugoslavia,
 but Bulgaria is also part of the Balkans.
 Exactly.
 Bulgaria had about 4,000 Christians when the wall fell,
 and today you have about 160,000 Christians.
 So a lot has happened in Bulgaria.
 But if you take the old Yugoslavia, there are very few Christians,
 in most of the countries.
 Before the wall fell, it was a communist country,
 so religions were not especially welcome,
 and religions did not mean much to people.
 But then the wall fell, religion suddenly became very important,
 so there was a kind of identity, national identity.
 If you are Montegrin, you are Orthodox.
 Even if you do not know Jesus, you are a Christian Orthodox.
 So there has been a lot of tension in that way,
 and religion makes it quite difficult.
 It was quite open for a while before communism came in Yugoslavia,
 but now it is quite tough in many places.
 We have lived in Montenegro for three years,
 but I am still a pastor in the assembly in Montenegro,
 so I am a pendulum pastor.
 In Montenegro we have about 150-200 Christians in the whole country.
 How do you get people to a place like this?
 You are used to seeing churches here and there,
 if you drive around in Sweden or in many other neighboring countries.
 But when you come to such a country, how do you get people?
 That's a very good question.
 People are... I see them as sects.
 They are Christians, they are Orthodox.
 When you ask who Jesus is, very few people know what he is.
 What does he do with things?
 It's a long-term work, but it's very difficult.
 Like Montenegro, it's not easy to get people,
 but it takes a lot of preparation.
 During the years we lived down there,
 you feel that what is sometimes a wall, both spiritual and...
 We have lived in six different countries as missionaries,
 and it's the most difficult spiritual way.
 Sometimes you just have to fight, like, what am I doing here?
 So...
 Three years ago, the children were asked to get ready for the Balkans.
 So I said, if we were to see a breakthrough in the Balkans,
 we would need a lot of preparation, because there have been so many wars.
 You teach the children, when they are small, to hate.
 You teach them to hate, to hate, to hate, to hate.
 It comes with courage, but there have been so many wars.
 So...
 We had an experience in the autumn.
 You and I, Mikael, we went to a personal and prayer conference in Serbia.
 We went with good friends from Bulgaria.
 In the car, we sat and talked,
 and it turned out that these Bulgarians, who are fantastic Christian people,
 are of the best quality.
 But when we started talking about Serbs, it became so incredibly quiet.
 And it turned out that they didn't really know any Serbs.
 The Bulgarians and the Serbs, no, it doesn't go together.
 But then they came to this conference, and they got to meet Serbian siblings,
 because there were good representatives from all ethnic groups and countries on the Balkans.
 And a very concrete reconciliation was carried out.
 That you had to stand in front of each other.
 We asked for forgiveness for how we have treated you, and you prayed in front of each other.
 And they were completely different when we went home from there, and went back to Bulgaria.
 It was so nice to see.
 I think it tells a little bit about how closed it can be between people.
 And this is perhaps not least an expression in Bosnia.
 Where you have Serbs in one part, Croatians, Serbs are Orthodox,
 Croatians are Catholics, and then you also have Muslims in a third part.
 And they will try to get together there.
 I was at a Serbian pastor, up there.
 And he said, it's not a question of if there will be war, it's just a question of when there will be war.
 So it's a crutch.
 But it does, and I think it drives you too, Mikael,
 it makes it so incredibly difficult to preach Christ and to be down there,
 to pray and do what we can to break the ground for the Gospel.
 It's only Jesus who can save the Balkans, it's nothing else.
 And it's like saying, reconciliation.
 Because even between pastors there is a lot of split, no quarrels,
 even just in Little Montenegro.
 There is constant quarrel between pastors, and you talk bad behind each other's backs.
 It's not easy to expect that the Gospel, the message of reconciliation,
 will succeed if we who convey the message are not disillusioned.
 So it's a huge challenge for the Balkans.
 But there is a lot happening, I don't know if you've heard me,
 in Serbia in the last eight months there are daily protests.
 Yes, exactly.
 Young people have risen up, because there is so much corruption on the Balkans.
 Most young people want to move to the west.
 I've asked pastors, what is the biggest need?
 It's that we lose all young people. They don't have many, but they do.
 I was in Sarajevo a few years ago and met a pastor,
 and he said that I know there are 25 Christian youths in Sarajevo.
 Bosnia has about 400 Christians in the whole country, so it's very few.
 Of those 25, 23 have one dream, and that is to move to the west.
 It's not easy to build the next national assembly.
 They don't see the future, all the corruption, but now the youths are really rising up.
 Yes, they are. It's the youths who are fighting for democracy.
 I see it as a response, but it has started to deteriorate.
 The police just start to attack, but they refuse to give up on corruption.
 There are things that are moving on different levels.
 You will see a lot of things happen in the coming years.
 Yes, I think so. You feel that there are fluctuations.
 If things go right...
 I know that you are very committed in the pre-Böen, in the Balkans,
 both here in Sweden and in the Böen journey.
 I think it's an absolute key for things to go the right way, as you say.
 When God challenged me to travel to the pre-Böen, I asked God where I should start.
 And then God told me, in the course of my heart,
 I work in Uganda as a Christian in the centre of Örebro.
 I would go there, and God opened fantastic doors.
 They ask for a Bönebein, 24-7 for the Balkans.
 I'm going down to Uganda this week, so next Saturday I have a mission seminar
 with 200 young leaders, with focus on the Balkans.
 The Africans know quite a lot about how to pray.
 They know how to pray.
 It's exciting, but it's like God,
 it gathers power for Europe, and not least for the Balkans.
 It's great to hear about the focus that the Word of Life experiences in the mission work itself.
 Now we hear that it's starting to move behind us more than before,
 which means that the mission will start soon.
 We just hope that you are with us.
 We will be back, Elin and I, maybe with a guest after the mission.
 Sit down now, as we said, with an open heart, and God will meet you this day.
 After the meeting, we will hold a swish in the studio.
 The swish is to gather gifts.
 50% will go to Channel 10's media work,
 which means spreading the Gospel through media in Sweden.
 Then we also have 50% who go to the Word of Life work.
 It's among other things, the Bible schools in Macedonia,
 the work of Kosovo, India, and all their work.
 They are training teachers.
 50% will go to that too.
 You can prepare that at home and see if God speaks to you.
 I want to stand with you and support you.
 With one swish, we can sign two organizations that are supporting the Gospel.
 It's double as good.
 Exactly.
 Now we hear that the song of the Lord is starting,
 and we are filled with expectations and hope that you feel the same way.
 We are now leaving for a wonderful meeting, and we will see you later tonight.

 And I say this because Jesus is here. Amen.
 Jesus is here and He is the same yesterday and today and forever.
 He is the same as He was once. He can do it today and He will do it today in your life.
 Amen.
 Wonderful. Then we will fix the attention on the screens for a while.
 Friday, Friday, Friday. One, two, three. It's Friday!
 Oh, what a week we have had.
 Yes, really. We are so, so excited for Friday night here at the European Conference.
 So extra warm welcome to you who is new at the conference.
 It's Friday, new time. We hope you will be charged.
 And The Night is Young. We have a lot to look forward to.
 We have among other things, we have Youth Night at 10 pm in Hjelmhenn and Gårko, which we are so excited about.
 So if you are young, you know someone young, you sit next to someone young, tell them, we will fill the place, simply.
 And just have it so, so good.
 And I hope you got a glass yesterday.
 I got it.
 What did it become?
 It became Oreo Beach Windel. So for you Oreo, fantastic. Hot tips.
 Yes, I like it. Lakerice, your favorite. It fits a little better for me.
 But take a look in the app. The whole glass menu. Good tips, good bait. It's there.
 But don't look. Now we focus on you.
 Of course, of course. If God has done something, please share with us.
 There will be a QR code. You may have seen them on the screens today.
 Please write to us and tell us what God has done in your life during these days.
 Really, such a nice encouragement when we get to hear you, God, mix us together.
 Tomorrow we also have a singing god feeling with Elem Worship.
 Don't miss it. Come, take a glass first and then come to that god feeling.
 Yes, that's for sure. Thank you for that, thank you.
 I want to send them out in a dark world to spread light and hope.
 I really hope that these t-shirts and hoodies that will spark up conversations about Jesus
 and hopefully you will bring hope into your world.
 There's a lot happening in the world right now. I mean, it's dark out there.
 So much uncertainty. It's just becoming more and more obvious.
 We can't put our trust in this world. Not in systems, not in leaders, not in trends that change overnight.
 Because everything is shaken.
 So the hope for this world must be a people who build their lives upon the only thing
 that will remain the same forever. The Word of God.
 Moses, David, Esther, Paul, they were called for their time.
 I mean, this is my time, our time. Right now is our moment to grow.
 Now is our moment to learn. Now is the time to go out.
 I truly believe Jesus holds this world in his hands. And his hands? They are you and me.
 Solid, strong hands. Hands that bring peace in the storm. Love where there is hate.
 And light where there is darkness. A people built on the Word of God.
 God invested his son just to know me. So why wouldn't I invest a year to know him?
 For myself and for the world.
 I'm so happy that we get to vote for God's people year after year.
 But you know, a year ago, here at the European Conference, there was a nice brother and husband
 who made an important decision with his family. And I thought I'd bring him here tonight.
 His name is Patrick. Give him a hand.
 So when you came to the European Conference, sorry, the Swedish one,
 when you came to the European Conference, God started talking to you about the Bible School.
 Can't you just say something about it? Tell us.
 Yeah, it was really interesting because we never expect that we will stay for nine months in Bible School.
 So when I will share a few minutes what God can do in one single life of an Austrian guy,
 so be ready that he can change you in a moment.
 So when you actually came in, when you came here, so you came here with the whole family,
 So you came here with the whole family.
 We came here with our caravan.
 So we just spontaneously happened to end up with our caravan here at the European Conference.
 And we thought that we are so hungry that we want more than the European Conference.
 So out of nothing, people are starting talking to us.
 Why you don't go to Bible School?
 If this happens to someone, okay, be ready.
 So that was the interesting part because we felt both as a family,
 from one day to the next day, this is our moment.
 This is the time for us as a family to move to Sweden and get the best foundation we ever get.
 I want to give you in this few moments the appetite
 to ask yourself, is this your moment?
 Not because of my words,
 but because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.
 And it was really interesting because we did a Bible School before.
 But because of that moment and because of this decision,
 we never can go to the next country.
 And I explained it in a few moments.
 So we are thinking about to go to Portugal.
 Because of that, God prepared us this whole year in Bible School
 to get ready to save Portugal.
 And I want to be really encouraging you.
 It's not about your age,
 but it's the foundation of life.
 And the foundation is the Word of God.
 And we all the time here, people are waiting for you.
 And it's not because we are special,
 but the King of Kings worthy to get in his footsteps.
 So if you do Bible School or you have the chance to do the next Bible School,
 for us as a family it was a big decision.
 But we are familiar with this house here.
 And we are so thankful that here are generals of faith.
 Who built this Bible School for the next generations.
 And for us the special thing of Bible School was really
 we as a family starting the morning with worship and prayer.
 And when I stand here in worship, I feel really a deep sense of it.
 This is a house of prayer on the knees.
 Amen. And I think the testimony what we have,
 this testimony is waiting for you as well.
 So I want to really encourage you and set you on fire.
 Get equipped.
 And jump deep in the presence of the Lord.
 That will prepare you for the next step of life.
 Life is an adventure.
 You never know what's coming next.
 But you know that someone is on your side.
 Can you say something short about what's happening now?
 So yeah, as I said we end up in Portugal.
 So there is a long story behind God did a tremendous miracles.
 So maybe I write a book someday.
 But when you move with God,
 and trust him fully,
 and look not on you what you can do, but what he can do,
 then he can do everything through you.
 And now we are family with two kids after Bible School.
 So God prepares the whole Bible School year.
 To get ready for the big adventure.
 So now we are in Portugal.
 We live in South Portugal.
 And things have happened.
 And I want to really thank all of the pastors and staff in Bible School.
 And I want to thank all of the teachers and staff in Bible School.
 That they have given time to invest in the students.
 Amen.
 Give them a round of applause.
 I think that God wants to do and can talk to you here as well.
 The same way that he talked to the whole family.
 To come here, invest a year and see what God does.
 I think there are many in here that God calls to go to Bible School.
 If you are interested, there is a poster here in the top right corner.
 Where we really want to talk and tell more about Bible School.
 About Swedish and international classes.
 But of course you can click on our website.
 And if you want to go to the L.O.B.C. website, there is all the information you need.
 Otherwise you can catch Patrick as well.
 But God bless you and warm welcome to L.O.B.C. already in the fall.
 God bless you.
 My name is Delaney and I am from Kolkata, India.
 I have been in the church my whole life.
 Because my dad is a pastor.
 When I went to the Bible School in Sweden, that is when I understood the importance of missions.
 And how essential that is in our lives as believers.
 For more than 25 years, Word of Life has been working in India.
 We have seen thousands of Bible School students graduate.
 And now serve the Lord in various ways.
 God has raised him up to be a good man.
 And he has given him the power to do everything.
 He has given him the power to be a good man.
 And he has given him the power to be a good man.
 And he has given him the power to be a good man.
 We have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 And we have been in the church for over 25 years.
 We are called to go to the ends of the earth.
 Because all of these people need Jesus, just like you and I do.
 And God is calling us to go to the ends of the earth.
 Now we want to start sending teams to missions.
 Countries around India are waiting for us.
 It's time for us to go.
 God is raising up a new generation of missionaries from India.
 Together we can reach the unreachable and bring the hope of the gospel to the nations.
 Be a part of this movement.
 You feel a little warm in your heart, right?
 Be part of this movement.
 A cry from India.
 Here it says, we are missions.
 What does that mean? That's our DNA. That's who we are.
 And what happens if you have a DNA for departures?
 They get the same DNA.
 And we have got that. Hallelujah.
 And then we have pray, give and go. That's the method.
 And I thought I'd talk a little about that now.
 We pray, we give and we go.
 There was a Bible here that quoted from Matthew 9, when Jesus went out and preached in different places.
 And beseeched the sick.
 And then he saw the scars and was filled with the spirit.
 And what did he do? Did he flip a channel and say, no, this was hard to see on now?
 No.
 Did he go and get it together and hope that the times would get better?
 No, he went into the well.
 And then he took the disciples with him.
 He said, the well is big, but the workers are few.
 Ask the Lord of the well that he sends out workers to his well.
 So the solution is what?
 Yes, there are several workers.
 And here in India, only 1.4 million people.
 But now we're not just talking about India.
 There is actually one thing that we may not have talked so much about,
 but which was actually a very early part of the vision we had when we started working in India.
 It was that we saw India not only as a mission-taken country,
 but also as a mission-sending country.
 Amen.
 And this is already happening, and we will see much, much more of it.
 So many preachers and missionaries and evangelists and everything from India.
 Right?
 And we want to connect this with Jesus.
 What do you do with your disciples when they are ready?
 Okay, we can start with you.
 You can be the first workers.
 When he is the first worker, he gives them power over diseases and other diseases,
 and he sends them out, and he says, go out and cure the sick.
 Perica, the evangelist, the resurrection of the dead,
 the pure, the spiritual, he sends them out.
 And that's exactly what we want to do.
 How?
 You heard about Patrick here, for example.
 He is what?
 He came here as a Bible school student, and then he became what?
 He became a missionary with the Seamus family in Portugal.
 And that's exactly what we want to see from our Bible school.
 We train Bible school students from all over the world.
 We have had almost 11,000 students in this place,
 and we have had over 20,000 more in our international schools.
 Only in India, how many were there?
 There were quite a few, actually.
 There were 5,300 students who have gone to Bible school in India,
 and 2,200 have gone to the second year course as well.
 And then we have Vietnam as well, which is not so far away from there,
 which we also have in this project.
 And there we have had 3,000 students who have gone to Bible school,
 and 900 who have gone to the second year course in leadership training.
 We believe in training and equipping workers and sending them out.
 And it's so fantastic, because these are already on their way out.
 They are already up in Nepal.
 I saw pictures here from the first mission team from Kolkatta,
 who went to Burma with Anwar.
 And this is just the beginning.
 And this is what we heard yesterday about Willem-Mendis and his wife Johanna,
 who are moving to Asia to work with this,
 to help Asian believers to become cross-cultural missionaries,
 to go abroad from their countries to their neighbors.
 We strongly believe in this, and they already know an Asian culture
 much better than we do, and they look a little more Asian than I do, for example.
 I remember when I was in Vietnam the first time,
 I had to wear a mask to hide that I was from the West,
 and then I went back to a moped.
 The problem was that the one who drove the moped away
 was about half of what I did.
 So King Kong was visiting in Hanoi.
 But it went well.
 And it was a wonderful start, also on their next step.
 And we strongly believe in this, to train and equip,
 train and equip workers, and we really want to continue doing this.
 I think that now we're sitting here in Sweden, and maybe we're thinking,
 what can I do?
 We can ask and give to start with.
 So we can go a little further forward.
 I think a lot about the Northern Power Works guys.
 Can you see one in front of you?
 They're standing up there with a paddy lantern.
 And what they complain about down in Fjallträsk,
 that they don't have electricity, they're a little weak down there.
 If they turn off the electricity in Norrland,
 because they don't have time to think about Fjallträsk,
 and to us here in Norrland, Lapland, Swästby,
 like a good Stockholm Swede,
 we're not in Norrland, by the way.
 If they forget us up there, we're suffering down here.
 If we forget the mission field, maybe we don't notice it,
 but they notice it.
 And I actually think it's time for us to start stepping up again,
 in this area.
 We've had a glowing passion for missions over the years,
 and I think it's time to take new steps.
 I can say, tonight I'll dig a little deeper.
 Let us do this.
 We don't have that many meetings left,
 and we're entering a new year.
 I think we can just move the rib up a little higher.
 Should we do that?
 Can we do that?
 It's not about us, it's about those out there.
 And then we really believe that when we're wounded in the good,
 there's a wonderful
 gift of God.
 And then bread to eat.
 So he has given us the gift of the good,
 so we can do that tonight.
 And then we can transform into
 preaching Indians,
 preaching Vietnamese,
 and further ahead,
 preaching Laotians,
 preaching Burmese,
 and so on and so forth.
 The man in the power plant, he only sees water under the dam.
 Warm and cool, and Asia and everything.
 And when we stop our money in a collect box,
 or swish and whips in there,
 then it transforms into a preaching,
 evangelism,
 assembly plantations,
 teaching young people,
 training,
 and everything that's out in Asia.
 Should we do that?
 Here we are thanking you.
 We thank you.
 You said to the teaching young people,
 when you looked out,
 you said,
 you have been given as a gift,
 give as a gift.
 And we are like Paul,
 we say that we have a duty,
 we have a debt,
 but that debt is not our sin debt,
 that Jesus has paid you.
 But we have guilt,
 and it's actually a debt of gratitude back to you,
 you who paid the unheard price.
 And then also the believers who through generations
 have led to the fact that
 we today have been able to believe in Jesus,
 and have been able to receive the gospel.
 Therefore, what we have received as a gift,
 we just want to send on as a gift.
 So help us tonight,
 and lead us tonight,
 when we see a mission,
 we invest in eternal souls,
 we invest in valuable people,
 we invest in the future for the gospel in Asia.
 We just thank you for being with us,
 and you let your hand be over it,
 and let your grace be over that collection,
 let each crown do a lot of good,
 we ask for that from Jesus.
 So we just thank you for that as well.
 Manhal!
 So we can give in a different way,
 as you can see here,
 we are holding the screens behind me,
 twist, whips.
 If you want to give a promise of sacrifice,
 you can just reach out your hand,
 then you can come with a lamp,
 and then you can give it to my wife as well.
 And then, if you want a promise of sacrifice,
 you can just wave a little,
 then she gets one of those,
 then you can put it in the sink.
 Then you can also give a gift,
 if you want to give a gift to your aunt,
 if you want to give a gift to your uncle,
 and if you are with us on the internet,
 feel free to join us as well.
 It's great to be able to invest in the mission,
 in the mission's mission,
 in valuable people in Asia.
 You can just click on give a gift,
 then you can fill in your tasks,
 then you can also be part of this collection.
 Amen.
 So we just want to be sure that everyone
 gets a lamp like this that they want,
 then you can just hold your hand up,
 then we will immediately take up this collection.
 Thank you, thank you for being part of this.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Give you all the honor.
 Give you all the honor.
 Let's stand up so that we know where to give.

 So you are worthy of it all.
 You are worthy of it all.
 So from you are all things, then to you are all things.
 You deserve the glory.
 You are worthy of it all.
 You are worthy of it all.
 You are worthy of it all.
 For from you are all things, then to you are all things.

 For from you are all things, then to you are all things.
 Oh, you deserve the glory.

 Just give everything to Him.
 Give your hearts. Give your wounds.

 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 You praise Him.
 He honors you.
 He offers you.
 He gives you all honor.
 All honor.
 He belongs to you.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 Thank you for your presence.
 Thank you for your holiness.
 Thank you for your glory.
 Please be seated in the presence of the Lord.
 And then you can say thank you Jesus for letting me be part of this.
 Did you mean that?
 Good.
 You know the Lord's presence is not something you should take for granted.
 His holiness is holy, holy, holy.
 Now we will all be able to listen to the fantastic, wonderful brother, Ankit Saiwan.
 I have two books with me.
 If you feel like meeting him, you can run out after the service of God and get these books signed.
 Right, Ankit?
 You will sign the books afterwards.
 And the only book I have in my hands is called You Have Authority.
 It means you have authority.
 Amen.
 Say I have authority.
 Amen.
 And if you want to know what that means, go out and buy the book.
 Amen.
 The other one I have in my hand is called The Book of Faith.
 I really think you should bring it with you as well.
 Because this is not just theories in this man's life.
 The miracles he has seen in India, the work he has been doing since 2013, the breakthroughs he has been through are incredible.
 So when he says these things, when he writes these things, it is based on experience.
 So it is worth it for you to take note and listen to.
 Buy these books and get them signed afterwards.
 And now on stage, let's welcome Ankit Saiwan.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you Jesus.
 Thank you Jesus.
 Amen. Hallelujah.
 How are you all doing?
 How are you all doing?
 Amen. Amen.
 Come on, we'll just pray and then we'll go to the word.
 Let us pray and then we'll go to the word.
 Heavenly Father, we come before you in Jesus name.
 We bless your holy name.
 We thank you for your written word.
 We thank you for your mighty holy spirit.
 Which leads us and guides us.
 Open our eyes to your word.
 Speak to us in Jesus name.
 Amen.
 I want to talk to you a little bit about walking in authority.
 Amen.
 God has given authority to every born again son and daughter.
 But a person who has no authority.
 And a person who has authority but doesn't use the authority.
 But a person who has authority.
 They get the same result.
 And that is defeat.
 That's why if you don't use what has been given to you.
 If you don't use what the Lord has given to you.
 You will not get results.
 See one of the most damaging doctrines in the body of Christ.
 One of the most damaging doctrines in the body of Christ.
 Is so much stress on the sovereignty of God.
 So many Christians believe that whatever happens is God's will.
 He is God.
 And we are people.
 So He decides whatever will happen.
 And if He has decided that my life will be messed up then what can I do?
 Maybe I can beg and plead.
 That I may convince Him.
 That is not what Bible teaches.
 It's very important to know what Christ Jesus has done for us.
 It's very important to know what Christ Jesus has done for us.
 We were some pastors.
 Let me give you an example.
 We were some pastors who spoke this afternoon.
 And there was an Indian family who came to a conference here in Pohlivsson.
 And a Swedish family welcomed them.
 And they kept them locked in a room and said, yes, but do you feel at home?
 There is food in the fridge.
 When do you want to eat? Come and eat.
 But what they did not realize is that our culture is very different.
 So this family is waiting for someone to call them for lunch.
 And lunch, time for lunch, it goes by.
 Then comes the dinner time.
 And they are waiting.
 And the Swedish family is thinking why aren't they coming?
 The Indian family is thinking why aren't they calling us?
 So they are hungry.
 They were hungry for lunch, for dinner, for breakfast.
 Then they call an Indian pastor.
 Super offended.
 They feel super bad about this.
 What kind of problem do they have?
 We are starving.
 Why doesn't anyone ask us for food?
 What was the problem?
 They were waiting for someone to call them.
 Even though the family had told them, this is your house, feel home.
 Go to the refrigerator, go to the kitchen.
 What am I saying?
 The bible says in 2 Peter 1.3 and 4,
 according as this divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness.
 Ephesians 1.3, God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
 And in Ephesians 1.3 it says that we have been blessed with everything that is to be blessed.
 And he hung on the cross and said, that is the full table.
 And if you want to walk in victory,
 you cannot just wait.
 God, I am waiting when you will move.
 God, I am waiting for you to do something.
 No, you move.
 God moved 2000 years ago.
 He did what needed to be done 2000 years ago.
 Now is the time for the church to move.
 It is your time to get up, take your authority and take it what belongs to you.
 Amen.
 God, so many of you are waiting on God and God is waiting on you.
 Because Jesus already moved 2000 years ago.
 Jesus did what needed to be done 2000 years ago.
 He gave you his authority.
 But if you will not use that authority, you will live a defeated life.
 If you do not use that authority, you will live a life of defeat.
 Amen.
 Think about it. If Jesus wanted that he would do everything for you,
 why did he give you authority?
 Why did he give you authority if he would do everything for you?
 If every time you are in a problem, you say, oh God, devil is messing up my life.
 And every time you are in a problem, you say, oh devil, he is destroying my life.
 And every time all that we can do is beg, and God comes, I am going to fight the devil.
 And then God comes and I am going to fight the devil.
 Do you know there is no scripture in the New Testament where it says God will fight the devil now for you?
 There is no word in the New Testament that says that God will fight the devil for you.
 The Bible says in James 4.7, therefore submit to God, and you resist the devil, and he will flee away from you.
 In James 4.3 it says that we will stand against the devil and he will flee from us.
 The Bible does not say that God will resist the devil for you.
 It does not say that God will resist the devil for you.
 The Bible says you will resist the devil.
 It says that you will resist the devil.
 And maybe the devil is not fleeing for so long.
 Just two things.
 It is not complicated.
 Some people say, oh brother, God works in mysterious ways.
 And many say, brothers, God works in the unknown.
 God's will is a mystery.
 This is God's will is a mystery.
 No, the Bible says, don't be stupid, know what the will of God is.
 The Bible says, don't be stupid, understand what God's will is instead.
 Amen.
 It is no longer a mystery if you are born again.
 Jesus said to you, it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God.
 It is not a mystery anymore, because if you are a Christian, Jesus has already said that you will learn to feel the secrets of heaven.
 Amen.
 So I want to, today what I am teaching you, if you apply it, you will ground devil in your life.
 What I am saying today, if you plant it in your own life, you will just push the devil into your life.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Do you think you can limit God?
 Some people think, is that a trick question?
 Yes, that's a trick question.
 I don't want to embarrass you so you don't have to lift up your hands.
 But wherever I go, 90% of Christians say, no, you cannot limit God.
 That's not what the Bible teaches.
 That's not what the Bible actually says.
 Psalm 78 41 says about Israelites, again and again they limited the holy one of Israel.
 Again, again and again, they limited what God wanted to do.
 And now we say, yes, those Israelites were dumb.
 Yes, but the Israelites, they were stupid.
 But guess what? You and me, we are limiting God and we don't even know it.
 We limit God in the same way.
 I love the way the passion translation says it.
 I love the way the passion translation says it.
 It says again and again, they limited God, preventing him from blessing them.
 So they prevented God from blessing them by limiting God.
 Can you think about it?
 They were preventing God from blessing them.
 They prevented God's blessing in themselves.
 So if somebody, you know, they are praying, oh God, what's preventing you to bless me?
 What's preventing you from blessing me?
 And God says, you.
 For 40 years.
 In 40 years.
 So that means, God in his sovereignty gave us so much authority that you can prevent God in your life.
 God in his authority gave us so much authority that we can even prevent what he wants to do in our lives.
 But there's a good news.
 But there are good news.
 And the good news is.
 The good news is.
 If you can limit God, you can limit Satan.
 If you can limit God, you can limit Satan.
 If you can limit God, you can limit Satan.
 So you can limit Satan.
 You can ground him.
 You can put him down.
 And walk in victory.
 But the way that is going to happen is you will have to develop violent faith.
 But for that to happen, you have to develop violent faith.
 You will have to develop violent faith.
 You cannot show mercy at devil.
 You cannot say, Mr. Devil, sir.
 Please leave my house.
 The only, you know what, devil doesn't understand Hebrew and devil doesn't understand Greek.
 The only thing that he understands is power.
 He has to be kicked out by force.
 He has to be kicked out by force.
 He has to be kicked out by force.
 God is waiting for you to move.
 He has already given you his power and his authority.
 God is waiting for you to do that and take this as a visit and use your authority.
 You know, I've met people when they're going through a sickness or when their children are going wayward.
 I've met people who are going through a sickness and their children have left their faith.
 What should we do? God allowed it.
 Because unless God allows it, it won't happen.
 Oh really? Are you telling me God allows all the rapes and murders and all the children that are being abused?
 Do you mean that it is God that allows people to be raped or children to be sold for trafficking and so on?
 Let me give you an example.
 For example, there is a man sitting in a park with his son next to him, a small boy.
 Let me give you an example. Let's say there is a man sitting in a park with his son.
 And this man has a gun with him.
 He has served in the army.
 He knows how to shoot through a gun.
 He knows how to use a gun.
 And in the park, when he is sitting there with his son, a van comes and stands in front of them.
 And two masked men take the son and take him in the car and leave.
 And this man runs to the police station.
 And he screams at the police.
 My son was kidnapped.
 Why didn't you do anything?
 So the matter goes to the court.
 So there was a camera in the park so the judge scans the footage.
 So the judge sees the footage that had been filmed in the park.
 And he sees, even though this man had a gun.
 But when the kidnappers abducted his son, he did nothing about it.
 And the judge says, you are not just a victim, but you are a partner in this crime.
 Not because you intentionally did it, but you allowed it.
 The bible is telling you, when the devil comes against you, resist him.
 That's how you will ground him.
 That's how you will ground him.
 And every born again child of God has delegated authority.
 Amen. You don't have to fight in your own strength.
 You don't have to fight in your own strength.
 You have heaven with you.
 Jesus says,
 Jesus says that what you bind to the earth will be bound to the heaven.
 And what you solve on the earth or what you allow on the earth will be allowed in the heaven.
 God is waiting on you.
 You are his legal representatives on this earth.
 You are not powerless people. You are people with authority.
 Amen. Say I have authority.
 Come on, say it as if you mean it. I have authority.
 Yes, Jesus Christ has given you authority.
 Amen. Authority not just to push devil away.
 Authority not just to push devil away.
 Authority to trample on snakes and scorpions.
 Amen. Authority to destroy all the works of darkness.
 Authority to destroy the plans of darkness.
 You know we live in a place where we get attacks.
 We live in a time when we get attacks against us.
 Against witch doctors.
 Against witch doctors.
 We live in a place in India where they hate gatherings and churches.
 We can sit down and cry about it.
 What can we do about it?
 Guess what? Jesus said you are the light.
 You are the light.
 And light shines the brightest in the midst of greatest darkness.
 And light shines the brightest in the darkest darkness.
 Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
 How is authority released?
 How do we dissolve authority?
 The bible tells about, I am not going to scriptures but I am just teaching you a little bit and then we are going to do an impartation for the pastors.
 I am not going to read all the bible verses but I am going to talk about what the bible says about this.
 Then we are going to pray for all the pastors here.
 So this centurion comes to Jesus.
 And he recognizes who Jesus is.
 He is a man who understands how authority operates.
 You don't have to beg. You don't have to plead.
 Authority works through a command.
 And he comes to Jesus and he says,
 My servant is sick at home.
 And Jesus says I am going to come and he will take care of me.
 And Jesus says I am going to come and help your servant.
 He says no sir.
 You don't have to come to my house.
 I know how authority operates.
 You just need to speak a word only.
 Just speak a word only and my servant shall be healed.
 And Jesus gets shocked.
 He says, oh Jesus, man.
 I have never seen this kind of faith even in Israel.
 Amen. People of authority.
 He says I am a man under authority.
 And I have people under me as authority.
 When I tell someone go, he goes.
 When I say someone come, he comes.
 Jesus has given you authority over demons.
 You don't need to compromise with demons.
 When you say go, they have to go in Jesus name.
 You are people of authority.
 You are an authority people.
 And you have to come to a place where you develop that spiritual resistance against the devil.
 You have to come to a place where you get this power of resistance against the devil in you.
 Amen.
 The devil hates when church knows who she is in Christ Jesus.
 The devil hates when churches know who they are in Jesus Christ.
 What do you do then?
 You trick them into believing that what they go through is God's will for their lives.
 If you want to know what God's will is, you should look at Jesus.
 He is God's will on earth.
 I have heard so many people say, God allows sickness sometimes.
 And in the Hebrew letter it says that Jesus is the exact representation of the Father.
 Not 90%.
 Not 99%.
 100% representation of the Father.
 And I don't read in my Bible that when a sick person came to Jesus.
 That a sick person came to Jesus.
 And he said, oh, it's you.
 It's not the Father's will to heal.
 It's unfortunately not the Father's will that we should help you.
 Because Jesus said, I have come to do the will of him who sent me.
 Because Jesus says that I have come to do my Father's will.
 And he healed all.
 And he healed all.
 Can I tell you something? If salvation is for all, healing is for all.
 If salvation is for all, healing is for all.
 Let me tell you that.
 If salvation is for all, deliverance is for all.
 So is freedom for all.
 Because that's what Greek word sozo means.
 Let me tell you a real story.
 A family when there was a drought in South Africa.
 They thought we are going to sell everything and migrate to the US.
 And they were going to sell everything they owned to move to the US.
 So they sold everything and they were very poor.
 So they could only buy a ticket from a ship to go to the US.
 So the only thing they could buy was a ticket to go to the US.
 They had no money.
 They went to the ship.
 They went to the ship and started sailing.
 But the father has no money.
 And now it's time for lunch.
 His kids are hungry.
 They are saying, dad we are hungry.
 He says, just wait for two more days.
 And he says, just wait for two more days.
 And when we are going to reach our new place, I am going to work and get some money and get you food.
 So the kids said, ok dad.
 Then came the time for dinner.
 And his kids are looking to the place where everybody is eating.
 And they are looking into the restaurant on the boat where everybody is eating.
 He is feeling so miserable that I cannot do anything for my kids.
 And the father was so bad that he couldn't do this for his kids.
 The next morning as he was walking through the deck, he saw the captain.
 And the next day he walks on the deck and he sees the captain.
 And the captain says, hey how come we never see your family when we are having supper, when we are having food.
 And the captain says, but hey how come we don't see you as a family when we eat every time we have dinner?
 He says, sir we don't have money for food.
 And he says, sir we don't have any money for food.
 He said, you fool, all the meals are included in your ticket.
 And he said, you fool, all the meals are included in your ticket.
 If you are ignorant about what belongs to you, you can never possess and walk into the fullness of this beautiful salvation that God has given us.
 Amen.
 Why do you want to settle for less?
 Why do you want to settle for less?
 Amen.
 This great salvation that Jesus has brought for us.
 This fantastic salvation that Jesus has given to us.
 Genesis 1.26
 In the first book of Genesis 1.26
 Let us make man in our image and likeness.
 Let us make man in our image and likeness.
 And let them have dominion.
 And let them rule.
 This word dominion comes from the Hebrew word radah.
 This word rule comes from the Hebrew word radah.
 It means to put everything under your feet.
 It means to put everything under your feet.
 That's why God gave you his dominion.
 That's why God gave you authority to rule.
 That was God's intention.
 That's what God wanted.
 Understand my heart when I say this.
 Understand my heart when I say this.
 Yes, we will serve God all our life.
 Yes, we will serve God all our life.
 And it's a privilege to serve God.
 And it's a privilege to serve God.
 But when God was creating mankind, he was not creating servants.
 But when God created mankind, it wasn't that he created servants to himself.
 Yes, we will worship God all our life.
 Yes, we will worship God all our life.
 Yes, it's a privilege.
 It's a privilege.
 But when God created mankind, there is no scripture in Genesis where he says,
 Let me make some worshippers.
 But it doesn't say in the Old Testament, in the first verse,
 Let me make some who can worship me.
 He told his intention in the beginning.
 He said what he wanted to do in the beginning.
 I want to create sons because Luke 3.38 says Adam was created to be a son of God.
 In Luke 3 it says that God wanted to create Adam to be a son.
 He wanted to have sons.
 He wanted to have sons.
 Whom he will give dominion.
 Whom he will give dominion.
 Those who will rule and reign on this earth.
 Those who will rule and reign on this earth.
 Amen.
 And that's what Bible says in Revelation 1.6 and Revelation 5.10.
 He has made us kings and priests.
 And we shall rule.
 Yes, we shall rule in heaven.
 And we think, yes, we shall have the Lord in heaven.
 That's not what Bible says.
 We shall rule on earth.
 We shall rule on earth.
 We shall rule on earth.
 We shall rule on earth where there are cancers.
 We shall rule on earth where there is cancer.
 Where there is depression.
 We will rule in the midst of our enemies.
 We shall have the Lord over our enemies.
 Okay, so God said, let us make man in our own image.
 What does that even mean?
 Does it mean that God looks like us?
 It means that God looks like us.
 What's his hair color?
 Is it brown or black or blue or pink?
 Blue or pink.
 What does that even mean that God made us in his own likeness?
 What does it mean that he made us in his own image and in his own likeness?
 In his image and likeness.
 If you want to know that, we go back from the beginning.
 And do you want to know that, then we have to go back.
 He created mankind in his own image and likeness.
 He created mankind in his own image and likeness.
 And in the beginning, when God created heavens and the earth.
 But in the beginning he created heaven and earth.
 God said, let there be light.
 And there was light.
 And God saw.
 And God saw.
 submarine
 And God said and God saw
 If you want to change your scenery change your sound
 If you want to change your environment, change what you say
 Saying comes first, seeing comes later, even with God
 Saying something comes first and seeing it comes after, even for God
 We want to see it first and then we want to say it, but that's not how Kingdom operates
 And we want to see it first and then we want to say it has happened, but that's not how Kingdom operates
 God said it first
 God said and God saw
 And God saw that it was good
 God said and God saw
 God saw that it was good
 And then let us make man in our own image and likeness
 My sons and daughters who can say and then they can see
 And then they can see that it is good
 Bible says in Ephesians 5.1 that we are called to imitate our heavenly father
 So if there are things in your life that you don't like
 You want to change your scenery
 You can change your environment
 Start changing your sound
 You need to command what you want to see
 The problem how we operate and how our father operates is very different
 The problem we have is how we operate and how our father operates
 In the beginning the bible says it was dark, earth was formless, earth was void
 In the beginning it says it was dark and it was chaos
 But God didn't say what he was seeing
 But God didn't say what he saw
 God said what he wanted to see
 God said what he wanted to see
 Let me say it again
 God didn't say what he was seeing
 God didn't say what he saw
 Oh you know
 I'm feeling like this, my family is this and this is happening
 And then you tell it to another friend
 Our problem is we keep saying what we see
 God said what he wanted to see
 Amen
 You need to start saying what you want to see
 Thank you father
 My son loves Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth
 Thank you father
 My body has no cancer
 Thank you father
 I am full of the Holy Ghost
 My God shall supply all my needs
 My God shall supply all my needs
 My God shall supply all my needs
 Thank you father
 I will live and not die but declare the works of the Lord
 I will live and not die but declare the works of the Lord
 But pastor
 Won't I fake it because I'm not seeing it
 Won't I fake it because I'm not seeing it
 No, that's how God operates
 When we see that God works
 We need to change what we are saying
 We need to change what we are saying
 We need to change what we say
 Let us make man in our image and likeness
 Let us make man in our image and likeness
 Who will operate like I operate
 Who will operate like I operate
 How does God operate?
 How does God operate?
 He speaks
 Do you know in the Hebrew when the bible says man became a living soul
 That word is man became a speaking spirit
 That he became a speaking spirit
 God is a speaking spirit
 And he made you and me a speaking spirit
 And heangoes to a speaking spirit
 And now science is catching up to what the bible says
 And science is catching up to what the bible says
 And now things are happening that the bible has been telling us in thousands of years
 Do you know that our words are energy?
 Do you know what?
 Don't freak out when I say energy
 And now someone might think
 Do you mean new age now?
 God made energy
 Just because Newton discovered gravity doesn't mean he created gravity
 So words create energy and energy can affect matter
 And words create energy and energy can change matter
 That's what Einstein found out
 Energy can affect matter
 That means the word that you are saying
 Can affect your health
 Can affect how you feel
 Can affect your finances
 In fact it can also affect how long you will live
 And also affect how long you will live
 Amen
 That's what Jesus said in Mark 11, 23
 I love the way Jesus puts it
 And I love how Jesus explains
 The senior pastors
 The best leaders
 He said whosoever
 Verily I tell you the truth
 Verily I tell you the truth
 He wants to stress on this fact
 He wants to tell you a secret
 A truth
 Whosoever
 Swedish
 Chinese
 Pakistani
 Indian
 African
 If there is a whosoever here show me your hand
 Whosoever
 Say to this mountain
 Oh Jesus but I don't want to say it
 I want to say what I feel
 Oh Jesus I feel miserable Jesus
 No Jesus says you have to change the way you speak
 Whosoever will say to this mountain
 Be thou uprooted
 And go into the sea
 And shall not doubt in his heart
 But believes
 What he says
 Shall come to pass
 He shall have what he says
 Devil knows it
 That's why he hates faith teaching
 Oh this confession business it's a scam
 Oh this confession it's just a scam
 When someone says it to you
 Say it with the guitar example I talked about yesterday
 Otherwise Jesus is a liar
 There is no gray zone
 Either Jesus said or not
 If Jesus says that whosoever can move the mountain
 And it's not true that he lied
 So who?
 My daughter Eliana when she was 9
 She started to have these growths in her hands
 And her hand became hideous look
 So many growths in her hand
 And my wife she said what should we do
 Should we go for a surgery
 And my wife said what should we do
 I said every day when we take communion
 We are going to command these growths
 To be uprooted from our body
 And we did that
 And then I forgot I got busy
 I was travelling
 But my daughter Eliana she kept saying
 To her growth
 And I had forgotten about it
 And she came to me after 3-4 months
 She said daddy look at my hand
 There was not one growth in her hand
 All those growths withered and disappeared
 Whosoever can have what so ever
 Jesus said it
 But it will not happen by you pleading
 And begging
 Oh God can't you see how big my mountain is
 And can't you see how big my mountain is
 And God says can't you see how big my authority is
 Can't you see how big my power is
 All that you need to do
 Is open your mouth
 And come down those mountains
 To be uprooted from your body
 Amen
 Just agreeing to what you are seeing will not change it
 Oh God my son is in drugs
 Can I tell you something
 Prayer is not informing a misinformed God
 He already knows it
 Oh God don't you know
 And all the angels in heaven are like doing
 He knows your son is in drugs
 What is the answer
 Is the answer acknowledging
 Is it right to just agree
 Or is the answer to speak what you want to see
 Lazarus died
 And Jesus said
 My friend Lazarus is sleeping
 And Jesus said my friend he is sleeping
 They didn't get it
 Then Jesus said he died in the end
 But he didn't want to acknowledge it
 But I am going to raise him
 So we can understand that he died in the end
 In the beginning we started our meeting
 And our work
 And we started to see it in these accounts
 Not in accordance with our bank account
 But in accordance with his wealth
 So every time we saw a big account
 We said it was Jesus
 It's just small things
 If it's peanuts for my father
 And all these accounts became smaller
 Because you will have
 What you speak
 If you want to grow as a believer
 You need to have a habit
 A habit to speak out God's sun
 To speak out
 To speak out what you want to see
 And I will tell you what happened
 I can tell you from my own life
 I have been stupid so many times
 One time I had cough
 I thought it was just cough
 It's too much
 I take some Indian masala tea
 Nothing happens
 My immune system will fight it
 One day became three days
 Three days became a week
 And I am just ignoring it
 And so many believe that
 Just ignoring the problem
 I am not coughing
 Ignoring the problem is not faith
 Jesus never told us to ignore the mountain
 He told us to uproot the mountain
 Jesus didn't say we should ignore the mountain
 He said we should throw the mountain into the sea
 I thought this would go away
 I started coughing more and more
 I felt so much pain in my ribs
 There was no stopping this coughing
 I couldn't sleep
 I went to a doctor
 They said it's a very rare tropical allergy
 And they said it's a very unusual
 Tropical allergy
 And I can say that allergy is a nice word for a restriction that the devil puts on you
 Is it a nice word for a restriction that the devil puts on you
 And you don't eat that and that
 And the bible says that it's freedom that Christ has set us free
 So I got this gas mask on me
 And tried to breathe
 And I was so embarrassed
 Because I had preached faith
 And here is their pastor
 And here is their pastor, he's coughing
 And while the song of the promise starts
 I get a vision where I see Jesus Christ
 And he has a rod in his hand
 And I saw he was very stern
 He was very not angry
 But very serious
 And he looked towards me and he said
 Why did you not use the authority I gave you
 And then he stretched the rod towards me
 And he said something which I didn't know was a scripture in the bible
 And he said something which I didn't even know was a scripture in the bible
 And he said stretch out your spear from Zion
 And rule over your enemies
 Psalm 110 verse 2 says
 There it says
 Lift up your spear from Zion
 And rule over your enemies
 And I'm sorry, I knew this teaching
 I'm sorry
 You know the problem is so many times we want new teachings
 We want something new
 But it's not about new teaching
 It's about hearing the same teaching again and again
 And again
 And again
 Till you are established in that teaching
 There was a group of young people in my church
 And when I'll preach something
 They'll say oh pastor we know it
 I said if you know it then show it
 It's not about the teaching you know
 It's about the fruits that you show from that teaching
 Amen
 Do you think we would have learned anything
 If our teacher would have said okay today we are going to teach you ABCD
 Tomorrow we are going to teach you Alzebra
 And then we are going to teach you Tecnometry
 No
 Teachers came to learn
 A for apple, B for ball
 Again and again and again
 Till we got it
 And I've told it in my church until you get it I'll keep preaching it
 Do you think it's like this
 Do you think it's like this
 So I went back
 I repented I went back
 Went to my roof so that if I scream nobody will be bothered
 I was angry at the devil
 So many of you are misdirecting your anger
 Do you know anger was given to us by God
 Anger is not bad
 Anger is not sin
 Anger is not sin
 When anger is directed at the right source
 Do you know Jesus got angry and the bible says Jesus was sinless
 I got angry at the devil I went to my roof
 And I said how dare you touch my body
 In the name of Jesus
 And I kept speaking the word
 And I used the authority and I kept speaking the word
 It didn't change for three months
 It didn't change in half an hour
 In 30 minutes I was completely free
 God wanted me to be free from the beginning
 But because I did not use my authority
 I did not resist the devil
 Devil is not undefeated
 He is just unresisted
 And the devil
 Listen to this
 The devil is not undefeated
 He is just irresistible
 He will annoy you
 As long as you don't stand against him
 You have to come to a place where you will be full of anger
 At the devil
 And if you don't get angry at the devil
 He will not leave you
 If you don't get angry at the devil
 The way he has been trying to destroy your body
 Your relationship, your marriage
 He is not going to leave you
 If you don't get angry at how the devil has destroyed your body
 In your relationships and in your family
 If you don't stand against him
 You have to come to your rightful place
 As a son and a daughter of God
 And you have to speak what you want to see in life
 You have to come to your rightful place
 As a son and a daughter and speak out what you want to see in your life
 Amen
 Come on can we give some praise to Jesus
 We are not powerless people
 We are people with authority
 We cannot carry this victim mentality
 Oh nobody loves me
 Oh when will my situation change
 Your scenario will change when your sound will change
 Your mountain does not need to hear your pastors voice
 Your mountain does not need to hear your pastors voice
 Your mountain needs to hear your voice
 Amen
 If you want to approach your mountain
 Your mountain is waiting for you to hear the voice
 One time a man of God Smith Wigglesworth
 He was standing on a bus station
 And he saw a lady coming towards him
 And a dog was following that woman
 And that lady was like shh doggy go away
 That's how sometimes people treat the devil
 And the dog was not
 And this lady got frustrated
 She stomp her feet and she said go away
 And the dog put his tail between the legs and dog ran away
 And Smith Wigglesworth was seeing this
 And he said that's how you treat the devil
 That's how you treat the devil
 You need to tell the devil
 Go away
 Back off
 You cannot touch my family
 You cannot touch my health
 You cannot touch my ministry
 This is my body
 This is my family
 This is my ministry
 This is my business
 This is my company
 We need to come to a place
 We need to come to a place
 Where we have the sword of the lord coming out from our mouth
 Otherwise the devil will keep pushing your buttons
 Let the sword come out of your mouth
 There is only one thing he is afraid of
 The sword of the spirit that is the word of the living god
 The word of the living god that is real
 So many families in India, their lives have been changed
 Not because something special happened
 But because they have understood their authority
 You need to read the passion translation
 Now you understand
 That I have imparted to you
 My authority
 To trample over the devil's kingdom
 You will trample upon
 Every demon before you
 Come on, can you say this
 I will trample
 I didn't hear you, were you whispering?
 You shouldn't whisper to the mountain
 Jesus didn't say
 Lazarus
 Come on
 Lazarus
 Come on, you need to be bold with the word of the living god
 Amen
 Come on, say this
 I will trample
 Every demon before me
 And I will overcome
 Every power Satan possesses
 Absolutely nothing will harm me
 As I walk in this authority
 Hallelujah
 Amen
 You have authority
 You have authority
 You have authority
 You have authority
 I'm telling you
 It is so powerful
 I have my friends here
 Oh man
 Oh lord
 Praise god
 My time is over
 But I have to quickly
 I'll quickly tell you a testimony
 And then we'll pray
 You will be shocked
 You will be shocked
 By the size of the authority
 You have been given
 I got shocked when god spoke to me
 Delhi is the most polluted city
 In the world
 Delhi is the city with the most
 Pre-organizations in the world
 When we checked the AQI meter
 The air quality index is like 60
 And the air quality index is like 60
 And it can only be counted up to 99
 Because those who created it
 Would never have thought it could be higher than 99
 But welcome to India
 It crossed 999
 And there was a time it crossed 1200
 And there was a time it crossed 1200
 On this index
 You could smell the smell of something
 Like a burning stank
 And people with asthma died
 And children became sick
 You could see dark thick clouds
 So the state started thinking that we should do
 Which was costing hundreds of millions of dollars
 It was all over the news
 And I was just praying in tongues going up and down
 And the lord just spoke to me about this
 And he said is the government answer
 Wow
 Because many think government is the answer
 In the last days
 The church of lord Jesus Christ is going to become the solution center of the world
 Amen
 So I knew what the lord was saying
 He said I want you to command for the rains to come
 Elijah was a man with nature like ours
 Elijah was a man like us
 And he prayed that it would not rain for three years
 And Elijah was like us
 But we don't believe that we can have authority over weather
 And the bible says Elijah was a man like us
 So I called all my leaders
 I said wherever you are come out
 So I told my leaders where you are
 Come here
 And it's sunny
 And I said we are going to take authority
 And we are going to command rains to come
 And we came out all of us we prayed
 In next 15 minutes
 It started raining
 It's not about how great we are
 It's about the great authority that is given to us by a great god
 Amen
 And the government didn't have to do any artificial rain
 And it has happened again and again
 But man I won't go home without preaching this
 And then okay
 Then I'll go back to India
 I just want to say it again
 Hallelujah
 Let me show you something that is so powerful
 You know when the bible says in Hebrews 412
 That the word is a double edged sword
 In Hebrews chapter 12 it says that
 The word double edged comes from the greek word
 Dais Thoma
 A double edged sword comes from greek
 Dais means two
 Thoma means mouth
 Two means two mouths
 The word of god was designed for two mouths
 And god's word was designed for two mouths
 Let me say that again
 The word of god was designed for two mouths
 God's word is designed for two mouths
 One when god says that
 And that word is alive reverberating in the entire cosmos
 And when that word is spoken it is effective in the underworld
 It has the seed the power to create
 But that seed is just reverberating in the cosmos
 And it creates in the underworld
 Jeremiah 1-12
 I watch over my word to perform it
 Jeremiah 1-12 says that
 When I speak out of my mouth
 My question is god why are you watching over your word
 Why don't you perform it
 Why do you see it on your word
 Why don't you just perform it
 Because he is waiting for the other mouth
 He is waiting for the other
 I will show it to you from the word
 Let me show it
 Worship him can you come up
 Ezekiel 37
 Speak fast you listen fast
 Ezekiel 37
 The hand of the lord came upon me
 And brought me out in the spirit of the lord
 And set me down in the midst of the valley
 And it was full of bones
 Right
 So the lord brings Ezekiel to a place
 Which is filled with dry bones
 Then he caused me to pass by them around
 And behold there were many in the open valley
 And indeed they were dry
 And he let me see
 There were many bones
 And now god is talking to Ezekiel prophet
 And he is saying
 Can these bones live
 Son of man can these bones live
 Can these bones live
 Whenever god asks you a question
 Don't answer
 He is not looking for an answer
 Okay I have learned that
 When you give the answer then he won't teach you
 And I don't know
 Whenever he asks you a question
 The best thing to say is teach me I don't know
 When he asks you a question
 Son of man can these bones live
 So I answered
 Oh lord god you know
 Now hear this
 Again he said to me
 Prophesy to these bones
 And say to them
 Now god is telling Ezekiel
 You need to prophesy to these dry bones
 And say this to them
 Oh dry bones
 Hear the word of the lord
 Thus says the lord god to these bones
 Who is saying to these dry bones
 Come on talk to me
 Who is saying
 Lord god
 Thus says the lord god to these dry bones
 Surely I will cause bread to enter into you
 And you shall live
 I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you
 I will put sinews and flesh upon you
 Just give me a second
 Okay okay okay
 It just went away
 Glory
 Thank you lord Jesus
 Okay
 I will put sinews on you
 And bring flesh upon you
 Cover you with skin and put breath in you
 You shall live
 Who is speaking to the dry bones
 Come on talk to me
 Who is speaking to the dry bones
 God is speaking to the dry bones
 But do you know what?
 One day when the holy spirit opened my eyes to the scripture
 I was jumping in my room
 God spoke to these bones
 But nothing happened
 Nothing happened
 Until
 Hesekiel prophesied about them
 God says to the dead bones
 But there is no change
 Now see verse 7
 So I prophesied as I was commanded
 The best prophecy you can release over your life is to speak the word of the living god
 Amen
 So I prophesied as I was commanded
 And as I prophesied
 There was a noise
 And suddenly a rattling and a bone came together
 God is waiting for other mouths
 The word of God is designed for two mouths
 You have to come to a place
 Where you only prophesy not what you feel
 But you prophesy the word of the living god
 Amen
 We have to come to a place where we are full of the holy ghost
 And we are full of the word of god
 And no mountain can stand before you
 I have given you my authority
 To trample upon snakes
 And to overcome all the power of the enemy
 And nothing shall by any means harm you
 Nothing shall by any means harm you
 As you walk in my authority
 As you put my word in your mouth
 As you declare my word to the situation
 Be alive
 Be a prudent
 Come on give some praise to Jesus
 We praise you Jesus
 We adore you Jesus
 Hallelujah
 Thank you lord Jesus
 I'm just going to pray for healing
 You know yesterday so many people came later
 And then they said we got healed but we don't want to testify
 Don't miss the opportunity to glorify what God has done for you
 My pastor I feel shy
 But it's not about you
 It's about giving glory to God
 Amen
 Hallelujah
 Samantha just receive your healing
 Come on
 People who are sick I want you to keep your right hand on the part where you are suffering
 We don't have the time to take testimonies
 But I'm telling you
 You are coming back with miraculous reports in the name of Jesus
 It has started
 And it will not stop in Jesus name
 Mind boggling creative miracles
 Will become normal for us
 In Jesus name
 Hallelujah
 Keep your right hand on the part where you are suffering
 And just receive your healing right now
 Father in the name of Jesus
 I take authority over every spirit of infirmity
 In the name of Jesus
 I command you to stop your manoeuvres and desist your operation right now
 In the name of Jesus
 All the people with mental trauma
 You are being set free now
 In Jesus name
 I command blind eyes to open now
 I command deaf ears to open now
 I command arthritis to be
 So many people are being healed of arthritis
 I command you to stop your manoeuvres
 Arthritis is being healed right now
 Receive your healing
 In the name of Jesus
 Be healed from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet
 In the name of Jesus
 I command tumors to dissolve
 Every pain is leaving your body
 In Jesus name
 There is somebody you cannot move your neck
 You are getting healed right now
 In the name of Jesus
 In the name of Jesus
 Holy Spirit I pray that right now
 Every person here
 I pray for the impartation of the spirit of faith
 I pray that spirit of faith
 Will possess you in the name of Jesus
 I pray that an army of faith champions is rising
 From this place
 In the name of Jesus
 Even kids in our homes will be full of healing
 Even kids in our homes will be filled with healing
 We pray for you Jesus
 Are you a pastor here?
 I want you to believe in the fantastic
 and incredible miracle
 We are just not called to preach about an intellectual Jesus
 In the name of Jesus
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 The kingdom of God is not mere talking
 But it is power
 I want you to just keep your hands in front
 As if you are receiving the impartation
 I pray for the activation of angelic ministry
 In Jesus name
 Father I pray
 That signs and wonders and miracles
 Will become normal in this services
 Thine I gonna see
 Lame I gonna walk
 Death I gonna hear
 In the name of Jesus
 Hallelujah
 I release the mantle of supernatural upon you right now

 Thank you Lord Jesus, okay, we're gonna do something, okay, we're just gonna look crazy to some people
 But guess what, we are called for a crazy kingdom
 Recently we got a breakthrough in India for our land
 To build a building, it was impossible
 Okay, I'm gonna tell you to do something which sounds crazy
 How many people are up for crazy?
 You are called for crazy
 We have told the team a song, if you guys can do that
 And as we worship God, I wanna tell you one thing
 Hear this carefully
 God is releasing new lands and new buildings for so many pastors in this place
 If you can believe it, as we do the worship, I want you to leave your place and just run and glorify God in Jesus' name
 If you believe it, as we do the worship, I want you to leave your place and just run and glorify God in Jesus' name
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 He healed my body, He touched my mind
 He saved me just in time
 I'm gonna praise His name
 His name is just the same
 I'm gonna praise Him
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 Look what the Lord has done
 He healed my body, He touched my mind
 He saved me just in time

 Yeah!
 Give the best words to Jesus!
 Hallelujah!
 Hallelujah!
 Hallelujah!
 Amen!
 You are going back full of the Holy Ghost
 and full of the Word of God
 You are coming back full of God's power, full of God's spirit
 and God's word
 When God told me many years ago that I'm gonna send you to Europe
 That time I said Lord who me? I'm nobody, nobody knows me
 That time I said Lord who me? I'm nobody, nobody knows me
 But the Word that comes out of His mouth
 But the Word that comes out of His mouth
 shall not return back void to Him
 So whatever the Word the Lord has given you
 hold on to that Word
 Amen and I'm telling you
 we love our family in Europe
 and I give you an open invitation
 come and visit us in India
 Amen, you are our family, we love you so much, God bless you
 Wow!
 Wow, what a meeting and what a trip here in the hall
 Wow!
 I hope that it also goes out
 and through the charms
 It really was a very nice evening if you ask me
 and you did
 fantastic confession
 I would call this a confession of faith
 of the best quality
 Yes, that you really get hold of
 that we have got everything in Christ
 and now it is we who can talk about it
 in our lives, to make it work
 I'm very inspired to go out and talk to both of you
 Absolutely, absolutely
 But now we will talk a little bit to you
 Thank you first of all for being here online
 We appreciate you very much
 In a little while, if you want, you can show some appreciation
 because we will make a swish offer here
 before we finish this little broadcast
 But before that, we want to present
 the guest who will be joining us here in the studio
 and this guest
 can be seen a little everywhere
 at the conference, I think
 I saw it on the stage
 It's good
 I have seen you take off your table, I have seen you go and clean
 I have seen you greet people
 and in all kinds of situations here
 Magnus Jidle, welcome
 Thank you very much
 We thought it was in its place to just say something
 about all those who help during a conference
 We appreciate the pedicants
 and all these cool promises
 but what makes this actually possible
 is a little army
 of willing workers
 You are one of them
 It is already obvious
 Do you have any idea how many people
 you can manage to make a conference like this?
 The first thing you get hit on
 is that either an army or
 I as a sports guy, I like teams
 a huge team that moves everywhere
 and just as you said
 In my case I came here at 7.45 in the morning
 and started the lock team
 and got to praise God and just praise it, fantastic
 and then you go over to another team that also needs to be done
 but I think they have said somewhere around 400 people
 to lead this conference
 It's impressive because there is a lot that needs
 to click with something else
 It's a pretty complicated setup
 because there are so many activities that go
 parallel to each other
 I am a pastor
 I work on a smaller scale
 but with the same thing
 and know that if it only depends on me
 I would have already done it from the start
 I am so dependent on
 a lot of other people
 I am so dependent on God
 and his time
 and so on
 and you said you came here at 8.45 in the morning
 then no one has come to meet you yet
 When are you coming home tonight?
 Around 23
 Ok, it's not that bloody then
 It will be long days
 It's fantastic fun
 and you think you can serve the Lord with joy
 I am not from Uppsala, I was born in Dalarna
 to meet my wife here at the Bible school
 in the early 90's, she is from Småland
 We have three boys today who were born in Norrköping
 We had 8 years in Oskarshamn before we landed here
 To see their children serve God in such a big assembly
 is an incredibly great pleasure
 We don't take it for granted
 We usually back the band and say
 Remember where we came from, from Lilla Småland
 We went around in small buildings
 and had a meeting in an emergency house
 and now they are allowed to be here
 As we said before, the son gets to play drums at such meetings
 and works in the usual way with the technology
 Our youngest son also runs around here and helps with everything that is needed
 You really get to serve the Lord with joy
 I think it's especially beautiful that you as a family
 do what I saw Gina do in the song when you were here
 and your son is awesome
 I would say
 This song that ended the rags-sense
 he really got to do it himself for the salary
 I know he doesn't get any salary for this
 but you know what I mean
 I am still impressed by this
 because this has been the case for all the years
 at the European Conference
 and the preparations are far, far ahead
 For your part, how have the preparations been?
 You have been here for a week, but how was it last week?
 We had to work on our regular jobs
 on the 29th of October
 so we got a bit of a break
 I know my job as a singer
 and I often say that I have a mission
 and that is chasing garbage
 so I try to do as much as I can in the field
 so that doesn't need much more preparation
 except that I tell my leaders
 that these days and times I can do
 and here it may be a bit different
 I know my sons
 some of them work here and some of them
 live here with 17
 they spend 10-12 hours a day a week
 fixing all the equipment
 and fixing the sound and lighting
 but they do it with joy
 it is fantastic, you are so happy
 I don't think there are many places
 that you can get this
 even with your children
 they know what is expected of them
 and what comes out during a conference
 to see their loyalty
 and let them build year after year
 is a gift for a parent's heart
 and you can't get that in so many places
 maybe in the Jewish community
 or in the church with horse-drawn horses
 it is like a school for them
 and something is established
 and maybe they will be with them for the rest of their lives
 absolutely
 something that you have noticed
 when you have been to different conferences
 is that you really see
 that the middle age of conference visitors
 is quite low
 and I was a bit surprised
 that there are so many
 that you can see the younger generation
 it is not only young adults
 but also a bit younger
 who want to be there and serve
 who also show up at the meetings
 and are eager to receive God's word
 it is very good during these conferences
 to get involved in this
 and to gather all ages
 but this younger group
 who may not always come to conferences
 it is of course incredibly important
 but I don't know
 what to blame or what is the cause
 but it is appreciated
 that there are so many
 young faces that you see
 and for me and for you Magnus
 who have been here for many years
 to see that one generation follows another
 I recognize them on their parents
 who were in some cases another generation
 but it is something incredibly beautiful
 I think it is exactly as God has thought
 that we have been together for several generations
 the family follows the family's footsteps
 we have learned to sing
 but it is not always the case
 but here we have the desire to live in it
 and it is something that is really doable
 and I think in connection with this
 that we talk about the work here
 and how much actually voluntary people
 who attend the conferences
 there is so much work in different ways
 you walk around here in the morning and in the evening
 and you see so many who earn
 and there are no bitter mines
 and such complaints
 but you are here to earn and it is to earn good
 you are here to do
 I think we do this swish as we mentioned before
 and this is the first time we have a conference
 where the money will go 50% to channel 10
 50% to the Word of Life
 channel 10's part 50% will go to spread the Gospel
 through media
 and we look forward to continue doing that
 this conference is part of us being able to do this
 and we will continue here during the summer
 autumn and in the future to spread the Word of God
 and the Word of Life, their work
 have you heard about it?
 go to channel 10 and Christian Media in Sweden
 with this important task
 to spread the Gospel through different media
 and then you will swish
 I think you are familiar with it so no need for instructions
 but here is the number, listen carefully
 1 2 3 6 9 5
 5 0 9 0
 I will say it one more time
 1 2 3 6 9 5
 5 0 9 0
 and then you do as you want
 you write in a large amount or a smaller amount
 everything according to taste
 but after such an evening I don't feel like you want
 you don't feel like you want to keep it
 yes, very grateful
 I saw several media on the phone
 with happy calls
 and we love this and what a meeting
 and we recognize this from when we were active
 and so on
 and then you write in your report
 and then you press on what you are now pressing
 you have to legitimize yourself
 but already now we say
 thank you so much for your gift
 and thank you so much for being with us
 on these broadcasts
 the conference is not over, this has been
 a worthy closing meeting, but the fact is that
 we have the whole day tomorrow and then we end on Sunday
 so we hope you can be with us
 and then there will be another meeting
 I don't know if you heard that in the middle of everything
 but we are already preparing for the next meeting
 but tomorrow?
 tomorrow we have the morning meeting
 and we will go live from the studio
 a little earlier than we usually do at the morning meetings
 we usually go 5 to 10
 but tomorrow we have a guest
 that we want to present
 and it's very special, you will get to talk about him soon
 but quarter to ten
 so 09.45 we go live from here
 and then you will hear this exciting guest
 who has flown here from the US
 and then we have a meeting with Henn and Warku
 and then there will be some activities
 during the day, among other things, David Ekerbring
 who is the new headmaster here for Livets Ord
 to hold a lead
 a seminar at 1
 and it's not on air
 so if you want to listen to that you have to come here
 to the European conference
 then we have in the afternoon
 a singing service with Elim and the word of life
 and it will probably be very good
 at 15.00
 so you can come here if you want
 actually Elim is on Livets Ord's YouTube
 I heard you today
 then we'll see if we upload it on Facebook
 but you can follow it
 and then we have the evening meeting
 where David Ekerbring comes to the stage
 at 19.00 and then we go live
 a quarter before the meeting at 18.45
 I look forward to it a little extra
 because David has been my pastor in Agape Nordkösning
 and now he comes here as headmaster
 and this will be his first
 it feels like the right thing
 he should be welcomed a little extra tomorrow
 so it will be a special meeting
 but we will have a guest before
 at the morning meeting
 we have a very exciting guest
 who comes from the US
 his name is Fouad Masri
 he may not be known for the wide crowd
 but God has put on his heart
 to reach Muslims with the Gospel
 he is of a Syrian-Libanese origin
 so he is well aware
 of what it means to be a Muslim
 he has given his life to Jesus
 he feels a burden for Europe
 because in Europe there are
 50-60 million
 with Muslims
 in Sweden there are over 1 million
 Muslims, a little ungrateful
 group in Sweden
 but he is here to encourage us
 to go out to them
 and share the Gospel with them
 and he has fantastic witnesses
 we will ask him to share
 a little bit of that tomorrow morning
 9.45 we hope you can be with us
 yes
 I think we thank you Magnus
 for taking the time
 to attend this conference
 thank you very much
 I wish you all the best
 they do a fantastic job
 and are very good examples
 thank you for following this broadcast
 and wish you a good night
 and a good night's sleep
 see you tomorrow at 9.45
 good night
