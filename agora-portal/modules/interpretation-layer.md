# Interpretation Layer Specification

Each file in `/core/theology/` follows a structured format enabling:
- Pedagogical guidance
- Cultural and tradition-aware framing
- Gamification mapping
- AI-safety constraints

Sections:
1. `core_narrative`: ordered sequence
2. `tradition_vectors`: multiple interpretive lenses
3. `pedagogy`: prompts and tasks
4. `gamification`: mapping to quests, virtues, and reflection steps
5. `ai_guidance`: safety and tone notes

See `parable-prodigal-son.json` for a complete example.
