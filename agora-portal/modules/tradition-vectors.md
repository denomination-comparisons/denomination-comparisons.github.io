# Tradition Vectors

The Agora platform uses “tradition vectors” to describe the interpretive
mapping between a text (e.g., a parable) and various religious or philosophical
traditions.

A vector includes:
- **emphases** (what this tradition highlights)
- **virtues** (what qualities it cultivates)
- **doctrinal_links** (or canonical references)
- **sources** (if non-Christian)

This allows:
- Comparative theology
- Adaptive explanations
- Denominationally sensitive reflection
