# White Paper: Agora Portal Crisis Response Protocol
# TIER 1: IMMEDIATE RISK (Safety & Suicide)

## 1. Guiding Philosophy
Our primary responsibility is the preservation of life and safety. This protocol is non-theological and non-judgmental. It is a **"triage and refer"** model. We are not counselors; we are a bridge to professional help. All moderation (AI and Human) is trained to escalate this protocol *above all other rules*.

## 2. The Trigger
This protocol is activated when any user-generated content (forum post, direct message, journal entry) is flagged by:
* **AI Moderation:** For keywords related to suicide, self-harm, severe depression, or immediate threat (e.g., "want to die," "can't go on," "goodbye").
* **User Report:** A user flags another user's content as "Immediate Danger."

## 3. The Protocol: A 3-Step Process

### Step 1: "The Red Lock" (Immediate System Action)
* The moment the content is flagged, the system places a **"Red Lock"** on the user's account.
* This is *not* a ban. It is a temporary, protected state.
* **What it does:**
    1.  **Hides the Post:** The triggering content is immediately made invisible to the public to prevent panic or copycat behavior.
    2.  **Alerts Human Mod:** A "Tier 1 Alert" is sent to all on-duty (24/7) Human Moderators.
    3.  **Locks Communications:** The user is temporarily prevented from posting *new* public content or messaging other users. This is to protect both the user and the community.
    4.  **Engages User:** The user's *only* available action is a private, 1-to-1 chat window that is automatically opened with a trained "Crisis Responder" (a specialized Human Moderator).

### Step 2: The Engagement (Human-in-the-Loop)
* The Crisis Responder receives the alert. Their screen shows the user's country (e.g., "Sweden") to provide localized resources.
* **The Script (Simplified):**
    * **Responder:** "Hi [Username]. My name is [Name], and I'm part of the Agora community support team. I'm a real person, and I've received your message. I want to let you know that we see you, and I'm here to listen. I'm concerned about your safety."
    * **Goal 1: Acknowledge.** Listen. Let them talk. Do *not* offer theological advice (e.g., "God has a plan").
    * **Goal 2: Triage.** Ask non-leading questions: "It sounds like you are in a lot of pain. Are you in immediate danger right now?"
    * **Goal 3: Refer.** This is the main goal. "Thank you for sharing that. It takes a lot of courage. I am not a trained therapist, but I want to get you in touch with someone who can help. Here are some free, 24/7 resources for people in Sweden."

### Step 3: The Referral (The Hand-off)
* The responder provides **localized, pre-vetted crisis resources.**
* **For Sweden:**
    * **Mind:** "For immediate help, you can call 90101 (Självmordslinjen - Suicide Line) or chat with them at [URL]. They are free, anonymous, and available 24/7."
    * **BRIS (for users < 18):** "You can always call 116 111 (BRIS) or chat with them. They are there specifically for you."
    * **Emergency:** "If you are in immediate physical danger, please call 112."
* The session does not end until the user has acknowledged the resources. The "Red Lock" is only lifted after the user is deemed safe or has been handed off to a professional service.

## 4. Post-Incident
* A report is filed.
* The user's account is placed on a "Care Watchlist" for 7 days, where a human moderator will gently check in.
* A (non-automated) follow-up message is sent 24 hours later: "Just checking in. We are thinking of you. Please know these resources are available any time."

This protocol ensures we are a place of safety first. All other features are secondary.
